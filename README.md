A webscraper that will scrape the reviews for two different Animal Crossing games for comparison.

A retrospective on what qualities in an animal crossing game people value the most.

I grew up playing almost all iterations of Animal Crossing (AC) (the only one I havenâ€™t played was the original AC on the Gamecube). I, like many others, were ecstatic at the announcement of a new AC game release, Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I have fond memories of all previous AC games, and was extremely excited for what this new game would bring to the table. When it released during the first COVID-19 lockdown, everyone was playing it like crazy, myself included. But when the initial buzz wore off, I found myself a bit underwhelmed with New Horizons. 

And it seemed I was not alone in this feeling.

There are a lot of opinions floating around about the differences between New Horizons and previous games, and I want to take a look at what the most common criticisms and praises surrounding each game are. I wanted to take a look at what people were saying about New Horizons, and compare it to what was said about the previous AC title, Animal Crossing: New Leaf.

I will be using Python, specifically the BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries.
