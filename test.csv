2,froomie01,"Apr 6, 2024",10,I believe this is the best made animal crossing game. It feels humble and welcoming and is structured in a way that lets the player adventure on there own and make the game feel very rewarding.
3,SnazzySlime,"Mar 4, 2024",9,"The best Animal Crossing. The villagers are fun to talk to, Tortimer Island is fun to play with friends (I wish I had friends). You have the perfect amount of town customization. You can place Buildings and other Public Works Projects, but the town layout is the same. Because you live in this town, you don't control it (coughs in New Horizons). The whole vibe is on point."
4,Luckysoda,"Feb 13, 2024",10,this game is fantastic i remember getting this as my first game for my ds at a garage sale the game has so much to unpack and is extremely fun
5,EmptyPeanut,"Oct 28, 2023",9,best animal crossing so far besides wild world!
6,lostleader,"Oct 26, 2023",10,"New Leaf is an Animal Crossing game that goes above and beyond compared to other installment changes. Everything in New Leaf is a bit newer, a bit bigger, a bit cooler, and a lot more customizable. New Leaf takes expressing yourself in a game to a whole new level and in its own way, making any given town different to any other town out there. New Leaf probably won't get those that hated Animal Crossing before to turn heads, but for those that got bored too easily in the older AC games will find a lot more to do in New Leaf. New Leaf is easily the best in the series, and one of my all time favorite games, and while I have experienced a lot of game, I still have so much more to do still."
7,kup108,"Oct 22, 2023",9,"The best Animal Crossing imo. Perfect map, character-interactions, and gameplay. Wish it had some of the quality-of-life features that New Horizons had tho."
8,Marioipod13,"Oct 21, 2023",5,Well... Maybe I just personally don't like animal crossing. It is too slow and grindy for me.Aside from the excessive grind it's a fun game.
9,leotorol,"Oct 18, 2023",10,This game was awesome it was my childhood game and I just get chills while a listen to the soundtracks 10/10
10,omfgkj,"Jul 21, 2023",10,"The game is amazing! Calm and fun, where you aren't forced to do anything. The characters are lovable, the music fits perfectly, and it's a fun calm game at general."
11,MythicallyLegen,"Apr 8, 2023",9,"I think to this day it’s the best animal crossing game there is. Much was added compared to the previous versions, town was lively and interesting, multiplayer was casual and fun. Only downsides are it can get quite repetitive but thats kinda animal crossing in a nutshell."
12,oopkp,"Apr 1, 2023",10,"FINALLY THEY GOT FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA TO DIRECT AN ANIMAL CROSSING GAME! He made 'em an offer they couldn't refuse and got his spot in the director's seat for the first time since the Godfather Part III (although I've never seen that movie). His influence shines through in every part of the game. First of all, the weeds of Wild World are massively toned down since this game came out 8 years later, meaning there hasn't been as much time for weeds to accumulate in my town. But also, Tom Nook is clearly inspired by crime boss Michael Corleone. Nook's corruption peaks in this entry, as he scams the player with really expensive houses. They also made him have a more sinister personality which I really appreciated. My only problem with this game is that it lost some of the charm that the other games had, but it's still a masterpiece in my eyes."
13,SatinFoil,"Jan 1, 2023",10,"My favorite 3DS game, and most favorite animal crossing game (other then original)! If you have a 3DS, I definitely recommend playing it!"
14,ZangBang,"Oct 24, 2022",4,"45/100
Animal Crossing New Leaf is an immersive experience full of warmth, where the relaxing rhythm of everyday life lulls the player into a state of quietly fulfilling, mundane bliss, surrounded by friendly faces in a charmingly peaceful setting. The villagers are endearingly vibrant and unique thanks to various personality types, even though their presence starts to feel hollow after some time, mainly due to the lack of many meaningful ways to interact with them and a somewhat disappointing amount of lines of dialogue. Nonetheless, the game partially makes up for it through its astonishingly rich customization options. An immense catalogue of clothes to change your appearance, but also countless furniture and hundreds of items to decorate the interior of your house and the landscape of the town as well, not only through the growth of various kinds of trees and flowers, but also projects that vary from small fountains to new facilities hosting new activities. As time passes, new shops and locals will open allowing the player to shop more, access new features and meet new characters. Slowly but surely, players will discover the incredible richness of the decorative and self-expression options the game has to offer, making for a gratifying long-lasting experience. However, as much as it offers an astounding amount of content and a unique atmosphere, the overly simplistic and excruciatingly repetitive nature of the few available activities, namely fishing and catching bugs, leaves New Leaf thriving more off of ambience than actual content."
15,Dairy,"Sep 19, 2022",10,"An absolute masterpiece ****, it has everything an animal crossing game has ever needed, it isn’t watered down like New Horizons, I would say NL is the most balanced in then series feature wise. The music is simply outstanding like 5pm, 7pm, and even the main street theme! Only complaints are grass deterioration, and the lack of other minor special npcs like Frillard, or Serena  but that’s pretty much it. If you have to play only one game in the series it has to be New Leaf."
16,varkaromlu,"Jun 13, 2022",9,"The game was very addicting. I played it for two hours or more a day, everyday, for months. After a while, it gets really repetitive, so I dropped it. But the time I spent on the island was magical, a really great experience."
17,Paperplayer,"Apr 13, 2022",10,To be honest its better than new horizons because of the villagers they have more emotion in this game than the villagers in new horizons but you can't build outside allthough there are items that would look better placed outside but okay I always wanted a steamroller inside my house.
18,Anthony_is_AFK,"Mar 9, 2022",10,"While I may sound like pretty much everyone in the Animal Crossing community, I think this is one of the best AC games, I think the mechanic of being the mayor is one of the best ideas, it really changes the gameplay compared to the games before it. The character customization is great with tons of different options for clothing and tons of new hairstyles (with some of them not even appearing in New Horizons to this day). The UI is easy and simple to understand for new players, and also has that Animal Crossing charm to it of course. The special NPCs are very charming and unique (my personal favorite being Digby), the music is great, and the online is fun. If your thinking about getting an Animal Crossing game soon  would 100% recommend you to pick up a cheap 3DS or 2DS and get this game because it is one of my favorite video games of all time, and I think you should play this if you are interested in playing life simulation games, but speaking of life simulation games, I just want to say Animal Crossing is absolutely nothing like Tomodachi Life, they are completely different games with completely different art styles, gameplay, UI, and controls."
19,albegres,"Feb 5, 2022",9,"89/100
This game has so much charm and is so incredibly relaxing. Animal Crossing is unique in the gaming industry and you need to play it to understand it. At the beginning you might not understand it, but the more you play it the more you enjoy it"
20,MunhozMCM,"Nov 4, 2021",9,"My Score:

(9) - Great!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------"
21,KNX2501,"Jul 17, 2021",8,Es un buen juego sobre todo si disfrutas de realizar pequeñas tareas para pasar el tiempo. Lo recomiendo para jugadores casuales o para aquellos que quieran algo mas relajante.
22,dojarat,"Jun 16, 2021",10,"truly one of the best games on the 3Ds, i remember when i first picked this game up in 2013 i continued playing consistently for almost 5 years and i still find myself checking in on my villagers!"
23,TheBlueBouquet,"May 14, 2021",10,"Even though Animal Crossing: New Leaf is not a perfect game, I think it has way more personality, more things to do, and more life compared to Animal Crossing: New Horizons and is the closest you can get to perfection. When I was playing the game for two to three months, I really got board of the game because there wasn't anything to keep me interested. As of now, there are less buildings, shops and other places you can visit, villager dialogue is far more repetitive, there are less special characters to interact with, and most of the ""new"" features added into the game are honestly nothing special. Sure, teraforming gives the more creative players more freedom when designing their town, but for the interactive players, myself included, are held back by these selling points of the game. Also, the updates in that game are re-adding things from New Leaf that were already in the game at-launch and were spread out monthly to pad out development time and adding things in the game so that they can give the developers more time to implement things at their own pace. Sure, in New Leaf, there was only one update, but it added substantial amounts of content. And in that game, the execution was so much better because of how they envisioned the game. And taking your mark as mayor sure helped to change the conventions of the franchise and gave players more freedom with what they can do. And in this game, there are far more special characters, lots of fun mini-games to play with yourself, or with friends, and much, much more. And since New Horizons was held back by a global pandemic, it was stopped from being the best it could be. And since New Leaf was developed when there was any compromises, they didn't have to worry about delaying content implementation. And New Leaf just is much more special to me, and I will continue playing it for many years to come."
24,Hedaki,"May 12, 2021",9,"Amazing! Amazing! And Amazing! The only thing is that the music in the OG GCN game is better, but in place, it puts you as mayor on a town."
25,Kefero,"May 7, 2021",9,"Animal Crossing: New Leaf kept me interested until the end. It's a very good and interesting game. If you want engaging material, then look no further. With Animal Crossing: New Leaf, you become a mayor of a town. I would recommend Animal Crossing: New Leaf to any fan of the genre."
26,CharlestonBit,"May 2, 2021",10,"This game.... Its quite powerful,
To Anyone who has never played it before you need to, the game itself is great but there's something else that is just really amazing. It has this memorable spark of nostalgia after a few months of playing and that never goes away. Which is why this game is a 10 out of 10!"
27,yeet2009,"Apr 11, 2021",10,"I love this game its really fun its a lot (in my opinion) the best one in the series, better than ""New Horizons"""
28,redpandaman,"Apr 6, 2021",10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
29,TG098,"Apr 6, 2021",10,"Really fun, one of, if not the best 3ds game. I have put 100's of hours in and it still has something new to offer every single day. Every villager has so much character, which I can not say about new horizons, in my opinion the best game in the series."

31,MrTheMan,"Feb 20, 2021",5,"I understand why so many people love this game, but to me, it feels like an app I have to check on every day for an hour and do nothing gameplay."
32,marcelkuvshee,"Dec 10, 2020",0,"A very soulful and memorable game, whose virtual world, every sound and every melody remains in the heart for life. Thanks for this miracle!"
33,obthegeek,"Nov 22, 2020",10,"the pinnacle of the series, and one of my all time favourite games. i've sunk so many hours into this game for a reason. i'll always love the memories i made with it."
34,Luccio,"Oct 20, 2020",8,"New Leaf brought animal crossing to a whole new generation with marvelous splendor and arguably perfected the gameplay loop. Incredible game anyone can enjoy, however derivative it is of its previous entries."
35,gamerz4life,"Oct 12, 2020",5,"What can be said about this game? On paper, the game sounds like it should be fun. You become a mayor of a town in which you move in, you get control of designing the inside of your house and eventually the outside, and you are in charge of beefing up the town and bringing in new residents. It seems almost like it should be a Sims or SimCity type game. But then you start playing.

First, you’re provided with a tent as you’re told you need to have a down payment of 10,000 bells for them to get you a one-room shack as though you just moved out west. Then once you finally get your house, Tom frickin’ Nook has the nerve to say you now owe 39,800 bells for the place and you can’t upgrade the house at all until you pay it off. Oh and don’t worry those expansions will be even more exorbitant fees. It would be okay if in like the Sims you had real ways of making money but oh wait, you don’t. You have to shake trees for fruit, go digging for fossils, pick up shells, some of the most mundane tasks imaginable and then the shop offers you a couple hundred bells if you’re lucky. And don’t forget that while you’re collecting things you have limited inventory! So after you pick up a couple items (your required tools count as pocket space) you have to run over to immediately sell or plant your items, hopefully it’s the right time of day and they’re open!

As for upgrading the town itself, your assistant tells you a few Public Works Projects you can set in motion, but oh wait those cost hundreds of thousands of bells, that you’re pretty much expected to come up with out of your own pocket. You can set up a fund for the community to pitch in but they either don’t even notice that this is going on or they’ll give you 2 bells. Wow am I on my way now!

The villagers are pretty annoying, many of them, especially the people at the stores that you have to interact with constantly, will say the same few lines over and over again, and you can’t speed through the lines of text! And sometimes you’re tasked with finding certain villagers but they’re not always at home, they’re busy wandering around the place at the same time you are so you’re most likely going to go through town several times before coming across them. Oh and then the real question. Why are you the only human in this town? And you’re not even given the option to be a different creature, you can just choose human boy/human girl.

Time in-game is real time, there is no speeding up. You want nighttime? Well you better be playing at night. You have a contest during the day? Too bad if you’re not home to play. Time and day randomize the store items for you to buy as well. So if you want that fishing pole or butterfly net you have to check the store each day, crossing your fingers that it’s in stock today. And then there’s hardly anything to ever buy in store. What is the point?! Not to mention the awful clothing choices, where if you’re playing as a boy you can still be offered skirts and dresses?, where you can tell the only real reason those are still being sold is to cover up their lack of choices in that department. And not only that but you can also use your wallpaper colors and patterns to change your clothing patterns, like what?!

At the beginning, you think this game is kinda fun until you get several hours in and realize that you’re expected to do the same thing day in and day out, it never changes. And you realize that you don’t have any real power in this town as mayor. The loan-shark Tom Nook has more power in this town than you. This game is just a major time-waster where you can do real world chores digitally. I don’t see the appeal of this series and I’d rather spend my time playing a game that has meaning, a story, and is FUN! (Or doing my chores in the real world, thank you very much.) This is more a game for little kids, people who don’t want anything out ****, or hardcore Nintendo fans."
36,TEMP0,"Sep 6, 2020",10,"Best Animal Crossing game of all time, or maybe even one the best games of all time. The 4th installment of the Animal Crossing franchise is an endless experience that can allow hundreds of hours of open-ended gameplay.

New Leaf is something I'd recommend for many people"
37,Botwisbestgame,"Sep 1, 2020",0,****/NOaSdO5H91M this game **** its just a mario party wanna be.
38,jikflet,"Jun 26, 2020",10,"Is July 2020.  While everyone is playing AC new Horizons, I had the crazy idea of buying New Leaf for my 3ds.   never played any Animal Crossing game before and I thought, why not. ? lets see whats all about.  I Still love my 3ds so one more game to play on it.   An oh, boy ..! I get it now !  Im obsessed trying to make my town the best I can.   this is a 10/10 game.  One day ill buy the switch version, but for now I think I have years of fun on my 3ds.  Great game for sure! it relaxes me.  is peaceful and calm.  is a pleasure to pay your loan and to get money for town development,.  Is someone by any chance is reading this and still on 2020, want to buy this game, let me tell you is absolutely worth it.  And maybe even more than New horizons, as this one is compete and all content is there.  no need to wait for more content updates.  The entire game with all items, bugs, fishes, etc is here and I love that as a retro gamer."
39,koyukon,"Jun 17, 2020",6,"It's a great relaxing game with few faults on its own. It could be better in a lot of ways however. Music, ambiance, exploration, better dialogue. They took a lot of the challenge out of the series with this game and I think it would have been better if people had to work harder for bells and rare items. Getting rare valuable bugs and fish on the island should was game breaking and removed the need for every other bell making method in the game. Animal behavior was too repetitive and should be more like the previous titles or better."
40,Nico49,"Jun 13, 2020",8,"I had a lot of fun with this game. The chracters have charm, the gameplay will never be boring, the grafic is nice and the soundtrack too."
41,Big_Ravioli,"May 23, 2020",9,"Thank you, loyal citizens of my town, for donating a combined total of 5 bells towards a new trash can while I spend hundreds of thousands of bells in order to complete it. Truly, if it weren't for your help, we'd never be able to throw away our garbage."
42,AskAtlas,"May 5, 2020",8,"About eight years ago, Nintendo released this beautiful masterpiece with very few flaws to criticize over.  There are native fruits and island fruits, which seems the island fruits have disappeared from the next title: New Horizons.  I have enjoyed the role of mayor and because I just got the game a month ago, I decided to time travel backwards to its release date to experience everything, event for event.

I have enjoyed minigames, decorating my town with every fruit (some I got from Harvest Day), and using features like Dream Suites.

This game however, is not perfect and some things did bother me, such as why an putdoor bench could not be placed outside after buying it from Nook Emporium?  However, this added charm to the house interior because no longer did I see a house as a house, but each room for its own story.  I was sad when I realized island minigames, island fruits, Gracie, Brewster did not make it to our island adventure practically foretold by tortimer island.  I saw there was also a campsite where I vould buy stuff, a flea market where I could put stuff for sale for any villager to consider...this was a charm in New Leaf that sadly never moved forward.  How does pocket camp, a mobile game, have more fruits than a Switch title (not that all fruit and vegetables came to New Leaf either)?

Nintendo should consider making New Horizons a superior title, combing all of what Animal Vrossing games have and could offer.  I am thankful for this experience, and I wish New Leaf wasn't superior to New Horizons in my experience, but until all of this could be incorporated there, I prefer my town compared to my island."
43,martimnog,"Apr 22, 2020",10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
44,flyingbeaver,"Apr 20, 2020",10,"This game is unbeatable. There’s so many things to do everyday. The shops are really cool and upgradable. The characters have really fun personalities. The holiday events are something to look out to every year. All the easter eggs in this game are unbelievable. I have played this game for 6 years straight and even the day before ACNH came out, i found new info about this game. A straight 10."
45,md5fungi,"Apr 1, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing: New Leaf may very well be the king of casual gaming.

Having arrived in your new town by train, the local residents mistake you for the mayor. Despite your pleas to the contrary, they are completely convinced, and you hilariously end up taking upon the role. The quirky, humorous charm of the game starts here and pervades every facet of the adorable world you’ll be a part of.

The goal of the game is simple but open-ended: expand your town and furnish your house. If the game has one shortcoming, it’s that the various activities you can take part in gradually unlock as you progress through the game. The first few days in particular give you very little to do besides catching bugs and fishing, but after that, there is a massive amount of content that awaits.

Massive is no understatement: yes, the main activities include fishing, catching bugs, planting and harvesting fruit, buying and selling items and furniture, and doing favors for residents, but there’s so much more here. You can inflate prices of items and convince residents to buy them on the flea market, shake beehives out of trees and carefully swipe the bees for a generous profit (this can be tricky at first to do without getting stung), acquire a golden shovel that allows you to literally plant money trees, open a coffee shop that you can work at, and even travel to a tropical island that has extremely valuable bugs, fish, and a slew of mini-games that provide you with medals to buy special items (not to mention exotic fruit you can swipe mid-game).

Making money (or “bells” in this series) is a central part of Animal Crossing: New Leaf. You’ll take out loans to expand your house, which you’ll pay back with large sums of bells. Public works projects (e.g. bridges, police station, coffee shop) cost bells, as well as items, tools, and furniture. The great thing about the game is that most activities are very viable for making bells. There are extremely valuable fish and bugs, as well as fossils that sell for very good prices. Shaking trees often results in items and bells falling out, not to mention the aforementioned valuable bees. Even hitting rocks with your shovel will occasionally result in valuable ore or again, a ton of bells. There’s even a sort of stock market with turnips in the game that can yield incredible profits.

Even more impressive is the fact that the game world is constantly changing without you even doing anything. The game plays out in real time, so if you are playing at night, it’s night in the game, which means you can do certain things like attend nightclub shows that you couldn’t do during the day. As the seasons change in real life, the seasons change in Animal Crossing, which affects the availability of bugs and fish, the look of the town, and what events take place.

Special events keep the game exciting. On April Fool’s day, a character will show up in your town and impersonate villagers, and you are tasked with figuring out who the impostor is. Every so often, fishing tournaments are held. A fun spin on trick-or-treating takes place every Halloween.

Overall, New Leaf is pretty close to being the ultimate casual video game. There’s an astounding amount of content here, and one could easily spend hundreds of hours exploring all of it."
46,ShoujoWitch,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Figured I'd put a review up for New Leaf as I had signed up for metacritic to review the new game (New Horizons). New Leaf is aguably the definitive animal crossing. There's a few things missing from previous games, but nothing major. And the additions make it well worth the purchase. The game is absolutely jam packed with content, and improves upon the previous games in every way. They also went and made a huge downloadable update that gives tons of new content in the game, including fully playable minigames; with the return of a new entry in the puzzle league series which is amazing  @.@. Only nit-pick: the public works projects are really slow and kinda annoying to get going as you have to hope you randomly get one from the npcs, and then it's fairly expensive to get it set up. I never ended up getting certain major buildings in the game.

All in all, New Leaf is the animal crossing game I'd point people to when they ask which version they should play. And is one of the few games I've spent hundreds of hours in."
47,Mrisser,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"This is exactly the sort of game that I would love. I spent months being excited for the release of this game. I had never played animal crossing before and was excited to experience everything the game offered. Unfortunately, the game is poorly designed and there is only one island PER SWITCH. So while I was working, my girlfriend got the mesume and the shops on her profile. But because we share the same island, when I went to play all of those tasks had already been completed. I don't get to play significant portions of the game, it is as simple as that. The game progresses when I am not playing. It is an awful system that makes my girlfriend feel bad for playing and me feel bad for not playing. The gameplay is good, but I have lost all interest from the fact that so much was done without me. I don't know how this game company thought for a second this was an okay thing to do. This is good game that is unnecessarily ruined by an awful decision. I do not recommend this game."
48,Hizubiki25,"Mar 28, 2020",9,This game is very innovative and fresh due to the role of the mayor and new features and content they added. Must play.
49,MarcSeriesX,"Mar 25, 2020",7,"I love the game, but I think the graphic quality is improvable and more things could have been added to the video game. But if you want it for a small console, honestly it's fine!"
50,alpharin,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"wow! i love this game! it's cute, addictive, funny and warm thing!! the best part of AC"
51,Dawcks,"Feb 19, 2020",10,"This new game in the animal crossing series made multiple leaps for the series as a whole. To me, it was my first animal crossing game and is what got me into the series as a whole. I highly await the new animal crossing game coming out in March. I would recommend this to parents who want to have a fun time and also for kids learning things such as city management and paying off things and having to work for your money. These things are why I believe this game is amazing for everyone."
52,Jciam3,"Feb 15, 2020",6,"I wanted to love this game. Its pretty, the characters are... nice, the music is amazing, and it had a lot of effort put into it. I love this game for these reasons, and i think it is a good game, but its just not for me. I dont find much of what you do entertaining, as it can get repetitive, the characters are all the same and quite bland, and, for me at least,  there's not much to do."
53,GameBoy66,"Feb 11, 2020",9,"This game is super good, even when it's over 6 years old.  The game is super adorable,  it's super addictive, and is one of the most engaging Animal Crossing games.  Even though it is super addictive, you can't play for more than 2 hours a day because there are only some things you can do.  But this doesn't impact the rating because the pros overpower the cons by 5 times."
54,SuperKrampus,"Feb 1, 2020",10,"It’s Animal Crossing. Always 10/10! But to elaborate, the games puts you in the position of mayor. You can change ordinances and build ships. You can even construct public works projects. This game is all around amazing!"
55,twinklyten,"Jan 25, 2020",9,I love this game. Such a huge stepup from the previous games while retaining that animal crossing charm.
56,ourendlesseason,"Dec 14, 2019",9,"Grazie Nintendo per averci regalato questa perla. Veniamo catapultati in questa cittadina abitata da dolci e carini animali con cui poter fare tante belle chiacchiere, dove possiamo anche pescare, raccogliere frutti e decorare la nostra casa. Un gioco tranquillo e rilassante che ti mette il sorriso sulle labbra.

Sicuramente non un gioco per gli amanti dell'avventura e dell'horror."
57,vodkaffee,"Dec 13, 2019",2,"I do not understand this game, i literally do not understand why people like it, why would i want to send cards to my own villagers, i can put horrible things about them and they would say they love it and is kawaii, seriously wtf
maybe is because in my country people dont have 3ds because are very expensive and i dont have any friend with the game.... but the game should still stand on it's own without online, and it doesnt, this game is literally ""why didnt i buy **** valley or a harvest moon game, is the same **** thing with better characters and actual fun things to do not just collecting and selling the same fruit everyday""

EDIT: BTW i have +50 hours in the game dont tell me i didnt try"
58,AShinyGiratina,"Nov 21, 2019",10,"I have a 312 hour save file for this game, as I still play it regularly after 6 years. This game is the true pinnacle of the life simulation genre and I don't think a better game in this genre will ever be released."
59,new2dsxl,"Sep 6, 2019",9,"New Leaf is designed to be played in small chunks, every day, over a very long period of time, and stresses this fact by slowly unwinding events in real-time. Yet it is apparent from only a comparably short time — as opposed to months and years — spent with the game that Nintendo has done a great deal to address the complaints of its Wii predecessor, and provided plenty of exciting new features and buildings to enjoy. Taking on the role of Mayor is a great innovation to the series, finally giving the player a real reason to keep coming back time and time again.

It's a shame that powers of the Mayor are slightly limited to installing benches, instating pre-designated laws and occasionally building bigger venues, however the vibrant visuals and delightful gameplay of New Leaf stop this from ever becoming too much of a problem, making New Leaf the latest essential member of your 3DS collection."
60,brendo214,"Aug 9, 2019",5,I think that the Animal Crossing games just might not be for me. I find the gameplay kind of boring and a little bit pointless seeing as there is no end to the game.
61,momstiel,"Jul 16, 2019",10,"Incredibly engaging gameplay. I feel like there's always something I can do - whether it be working to make a new project, collect bugs/fish/etc, plant, design, or just hang around with the villagers. My favorite aspect is that it runs on a true to time feature so that each new in life day there's new content."
62,r4igamer,"Jun 16, 2019",9,"Animal Crossing: New Leaf isn’t just a game – it’s a whole new world full of lovable characters and insurmountable charm. A world where you'll sometimes find a Metroid or a Triforce in a fortune cookie, where you can arrange your surroundings to perfectly suit your tastes, and where the Mayor still chips in at the local coffee joint. Every day feels different from the last, like you’re living out a separate (and wonderful) life with your wacky villagers. There’s always something to work toward, something to look forward to, something to be proud of or to remember fondly. New Leaf is a truly magical game, one that you can easily expect to invest hundreds of hours in over the course of years. Anyone with access to a 3DS should absolutely give this game a try - just be prepared to kiss your “real” life goodbye."
63,Skwiizzii,"May 28, 2019",10,"I have been playing this game at least 15 hours a month since 2012. Sometimes I get bored and play only around 10, but months I love it get to 50 or more hours. This game is amazing. It is the only game I can play for years and still be my favorite game. Do not get in to this game thinking you'll be playing hours a day, because you won't. You can do small tasks every day like fishing or catching bugs for the museum or money, picking fruit for money, finding fossils for the museum or money, and talking to villagers. These tasks can range from 30 minutes going fast, to hours long taking your time and having fun. You can also do tasks like picking fruit, fishing, catching bugs or trading items with villagers. These may seem like boring tasks but are really fun. The music for this game is also amazing and makes you super relaxed. Amazing game and only 20$?! Defiantly should be one of your first 2/3DS pickups."
64,TJ_of_Carolina,"Jan 10, 2019",9,"The best life simulation out there so far. Makes significant improvements from previous games including seemingly small quality of life changes like donating multiple things to the museum, switching tools with the D pad instead of bringing up your inventory constantly, Being able to stack items like fruits in your inventory, etc. One of the biggest additions are Public Works Projects which can be used to improve your town, these are mostly aesthetic but some Projects have their own uses. You will find yourself grinding for money even more than in other games due to the works projects giving you another thing to pay off. The dialogue is not as interesting as the GameCube original but that's the one thing the original has over this game. The Welcome Amiibo update also adds Happy Home Designer style touchscreen furniture moving which is very convenient."
65,Bbplayer,"Jan 3, 2019",8,"It's a good relaxing time, and fun to keep up with. For about 5 months, which is a long time for a videogame.  Nothing that will wow you, but still a great game."
66,dislexicpotato,"Dec 18, 2018",8,"With impressive visuals, tons of fresh ideas and a relaxing sensation that no other game can provide, Animal Crossing New Leaf is a fantastic game for some casual fun and short gameplay sessions."
67,dorffy,"Dec 4, 2018",9,"This game is everything an animal crossing game should be, Its fun simplistic and addicting. You can play this game for days to months without ever feeling old. However the end game takes way too long, like I've been playing for years and I'm still no closing to beating it than the day i first bought it. Besides that its one of my favorite games on the 3ds."
68,HiHallo123,"Aug 17, 2018",10,One of the best games I have ever played. In 2014 I hardly did anything different than playing this game. I just enjoyed finding new things or catching fish and beetles. The house had to be extended to put more furniture in there. 10/10 game. Would like to play again.
69,MayorElla,"Jun 1, 2018",10,"The best game I have ever played. Great soundtrack except for the hourly themes I didn't like as much as in the other games. Some people just can't get into this game, and many others lose their entire lives to it. There is no set objective, and if you try to describe the series concept to someone who hasn't played it before it sounds dumb, but it is surprisingly more fun than it seems.
The customization is great, with infinite different options for furniture and town layouts. Swimming and setting down public works projects are a bit finicky, but that will definitely improve in the future. The different furniture and public works projects are varied and great. I have spent so much time on this game and have fallen in love with the series because of it.
The island and online connectivity gave me many great memories and friends I will always remember. Offline was great too while talking to villagers in my town and becoming best friends with them. Hyped beyond measure for a new installment to this series that improves and expands upon Animal Crossing: New Leaf."
70,What_A_nerd,"Mar 8, 2018",8,"As an old Animal Crossing fan I was exited of the release of Animal Crossing New Leaf, when I first played the game I was struck with the pure joy of this game. The music was great and every time i hear the title screen I just want to smile! But I have to lower the score a little bit because the  game could get repetitive at  times, but overall I would recommend any parent to give their child this amazing game."
71,Sressiv,"Mar 5, 2018",8,"I think this is the best game in the series so far. Great visuals, a great soundtrack and very calming gameplay. The whole island setting is pretty awesome. Even better than the DS version which was my favourite before this one. It's so relaxing just walking through your little village doing whatever you like. Amazing game, the online is great too. The fact that you can be the mayor gives you lots of freedom and opens new possibilities."
72,SortOfCritic,"Jan 1, 2018",10,"Animal Crossing New Leaf is absolute entertainment. Taking on the role of Mayor, you get to customize your town however you like. Its free-like game play and portability make it a must have for 3ds players"
73,Sausage22,"Nov 7, 2017",8,Really fun game that requires from you daily visits. If not characters will get mad at you and your city will be in ruin. There'a a lot of suprises waiting for the player if you are patient with it.
74,BJarms,"Oct 16, 2017",10,"All of the countless hours I've spent playing this game was countless. The characters, lifestyle, overworld, simulation and completionism was done very well and can take forever to finish (in a good way.) This game can make you smile, which can be a great thing while gaming. Not to mention the thousands of items you can place in your home! No wonder they brought it back to include amiibo functionality and chop 50% off the price. This game is an angel, but I will warn you, do not use the time travel trick. It will only punish you. My favorite villager left town and I haven't seen him for a long time except for a little while back. You can cycle through villagers though. See YouTube. Regardless, it's a cute game and can be educational in some ways. Great for kids, AND man-children. It's a classic, and I love the franchise."
75,Hiiiiiii,"Sep 22, 2017",10,This game is really fun have been playing since it came out and I have never regretted it I would recommend this game and its full of surprises ️️ And u can play with friends & family what fun 
76,kee113455,"Sep 18, 2017",0,"Most boring game I've ever played. There is barely anything new you can do each day and nothing you do is engaging or fun. Terrible game, wouldn't recommend."
77,Kallenovsky,"Sep 15, 2017",9,"Animal Crossing: New Leaf is an excellent fourth outing for the cutesy Nintendo life simulator series. Traditionally, Animal Crossing games draw you in with a basic premise: create a character, move in to a new village, make some animal friends, and live your life. While the series has moved on from some of the more vulgar conversations that one could have with animals on the original Gamecube title, New Leaf does offer so much more that blows every other AC game in the series out of the water.

Basically, there's just so much to do. You've still got fishing, bug catching, and everything else you should be familiar with if you've ever played an AC game. The difference in New Leaf is that now your villager is the mayor. You decide what projects to take on and fund. Essentially, the entire village's appearance is now at your fingertips. Clothing design at the Abel Sisters has improved, having added a QR code reader to download user-created content online. There's also compatibility with another AC game on the 3DS, Happy Home Designer.

Nothing is perfect however as you will have to wait a long time to unlock all of the shops and building materials. Simply put, you will need to put in more work than ever before to get things to look exactly how you want them to. Unfortunately, by the time you actually have everything that you want at your disposal, you may have already lost interest in the game. There's also the issue of Amiibos and Amiibo cards. They are all ridiculously expensive and there are a lot to collect. All this aside, I highly recommend Animal Crossing: New Leaf to fans of the series and newcomers alike. I suppose the best praise I could give to this game and the series in general to sell it to anyone is very simple: this is the best game to just sit down and relax with. Play it."
78,MrTacoBob,"Sep 6, 2017",10,The last 3 games had a few flaws but this entry in the **** now flaws in my opinion! It's a fun game with new additions that make the game perfect!
79,RCruey,"Aug 17, 2017",7,"Where do I even begin?

Animal Crossing New Leaf is an entertaining game about you living your life as mayor. But if you think you are going to have to make an assortment of complex choices like taxes and such you’re insane. This game is designed for kids who probably don’t give a hoot about no taxes. But if you want to play a game where you do a bunch of pointless chores for your neighbors who rank from ugly to downright adorable then you’re in luck. This game will offer you just that.

Your job as mayor is simple. Spend your hard earned money on pointless attractions for the village. Then you can unlock certain buildings that will get you certain tools and such. The music is catchy, and the visuals are bright and colorful. Talking to the neighbors can be delightful or a horrifying experience. Just like real life, I know. You’re not exactly in debt from the get go, but you do have to buy a house just like any of the other animal crossing games. The controls aren’t awful, but can be annoying on how precise you have to be when digging a hole. Fishing is simple, catching bugs is simple. Having to be in town at the right moments for special holiday events does add a replay value. Being able to visit your friend’s towns and work together on planting, digging, fishing, etc can be an fun little piece. But honestly this game is just one big chore.

It’s the Sims with a lot less choices and more adorable talking animals. 7/10

Happy Gaming."
80,Kevexception,"Aug 15, 2017",9,"The magic in this game is hidden. New Leaf offers various activities that can last 2 hours per day. The idea of the game is more large scale in terms of time because it is a game that uses real time for events. Never mess with this feature and you will develop bonds with villagers and spend countless hours doing ""nothing"" which is actually not a bad thing in this game. Just play it, you'll love it."
81,jdcomix,"Jun 21, 2017",10,"One of my favorite games of all time, and the best 3DS game by a long shot, nothing comes close. An absolute masterpiece ****. So much variety in gameplay, and the number of options is astounding."
82,Zionif,"May 25, 2017",10,"Has a LOT of items to collect and things to do, nice tunes, multiplayer action for up to 4 people at the same time (local or online), nice amiibo compatibility with the latest update."
83,AsrielDreemur,"Mar 16, 2017",8,"I had played this game for over a month now and decided i would write a review on this game. This is my first ever animal crossing game so i don't have any knowledge on any pass animal crossing game. But what i can tell you it's that AC is a really relaxing and enjoyable game, there is no purpose in this game but managing your village and your villager. There are tons of activities you can do in AC such as bug catching, fishing, building new facilities and so on and forth. How fast you progress in the game depend on the player play style, you could either take it slow and steady like me or you can grind by catching bugs and fishing to earn bells in order to improve your village. ACNL is just a game that makes you get addicted to it and you would keep coming back wanting for more. Overall it's one of the better life stimulation game out there and if you're into life stimulation games or had been wanting to play a more lay back game, ACNL is just the game for you."

85,likea24,"Feb 15, 2017",10,"This game is a addiction to me. Catching bugs, fish, talking to folks, going to the island, play online, and other activities. Finding secrets in this game is a fun experience and you should definitely play it. It's for all ages, this is worth 20 bucks than any item in this world. If you don't have 20 bucks, ask your mom, this is a innocent and fun game for them to play too. The graphics are at its best for the 3ds, smooth controls, and the 3d is great on the 3ds. Everyone needs to play this wonderful game. This is why I gave this game a ten."
86,Poobeebles,"Jan 17, 2017",10,This game is addicting and fun. Who knew doing chores for animals would be as fun as this the game is so much like it's original but better! This game deserves as much credit as possible.
87,MaxiRE123,"Dec 11, 2016",9,"This is a very addicting game! I have put over 130h into the game, and still havent discover or did everything the game has to offer! Beware It's be be pretty repetitive, as you'll have to do the same task for a couples of days to get enough money to do what you wanted, but since It's meant to be played by little session time, It's not a major problem. This game is very friendly, very easy and let you do things your way. Must play for any 3DS owner! (PS: the game was just updated to add new feature, most notably the amiibo, which means that you can now have freaking Link in your village, and acouple of others! It's good and refreshing!)"
88,geo333,"Oct 5, 2016",9,"This game is a life simulation in that your free to do whatever you please to do. You can buy a house,built town projects, go to a different part of the island or participate in real life holidays(Christmas  etc). This game is not designed to be beaten, its designed to entertain the gamer for a few hours every day. Furthermore. it's soundtrack makes the game relaxing to play as you fish, hunt for bugs,look for fossils among many other things. The only downside is some players might find it boring as it might get repetitive after hours of playing aside from that; its great game to play. Overall, as a first time player in the franchise i can say this game is worth the playing time and purchase."
89,GamecubeLover,"Jul 3, 2016",10,"My 2nd favorite of the animal crossing series. This is my favorite 3ds game of all time. The game feels fresh and becoming mayor of your town is great! The graphics are adorable and there is so much variety. Never ever hate this game. I see people do cause they say it's ""boring"". It's a life simulator but a fantasy type."
90,wegie125,"Jun 28, 2016",10,This game definitely changed the animal crossing series. The changes are something that will probably stay for future games and still to this day I am hoping for another animal crossing game here soon
91,RSD4G,"Jun 22, 2016",9,"As an early Animal Crossing gamer, I have seen the way the game has progressed since the Gamecube version. New Leaf really makes a difference, everything I always wanted takes pace in this game, almost.

I love the new neighbors, how easy it is to visit somebody, the design options, and the freedom to build anything you want wherever you want.

The only thing I do not like in this game is that the characters in general don't have much to say like in previous games. In previous games, they would speak more lines to you, there was more depth in the conversation, and now you get many two lines dialog. And there are not as many different conversations, 4 different villagers could say the exact same thing to you. I hated that.

I loved the things animals said in previous games, how they spoke about lots of things, but now they don't have much to say.

Ahead from that, it's an amazing game. You can play it forever."
92,EpicLadySponge,"Jun 20, 2016",9,"Getting this game is a must-do for all Nintendo 3DS owners even if you have terrible games on it. If they're still selling these, you're in luck because this one is a must-get. Do yourself a favor and get it on a store near you or get it on the Nintendo eShop if you set up an internet connection and your Nintendo Network ID on the 3DS."
93,NerdyThursday,"May 14, 2016",10,"There is no doubt about it. I LOVE Animal Crossing. I've been playing it since the Gamecube and have tried (I think) every iteration since.

New Leaf is unbelievable. I purchased this game almost two years ago and subsequently logged hundreds of hours into it. It's easy to do when you put in an average of an hour a day for a year into the game. And that's exactly what I love about it. You can literally log in for 20 minutes and be done for the day, just to get lost in an activity the next day and play for 2 hours. You can play it in the car for long periods of time, or just check on what's available in the stores while you are laying in bed.

I love visiting other peoples towns and seeing what they have done. I love the feeling of wanting to catch every bug and fish.

I just recently started this game again (about a month and a half ago) and have played it every day. I've brought it with me on trips to DC, Canada and NYC and kept it on me so that I could pick up streetpass houses!

If you like Animal Crossing, get this game. It doesn't matter that it came out a few years ago. It's still relevant and their are still people playing! I just got 3 of my friends REaddicted to it. Haha."

95,SaltyNoodles,"Apr 4, 2016",10,"I absolutely adore this game. This game is most likely not for you if you don't enjoy games with a slow pace and not that many specific goals, but I felt that way too and I've ended up adoring this game. The first day or so that I played Animal Crossing, I was really not into it, I wasn't used to a game that had such a slow pace, but it's grown on me, and I find that there is more to do the more I play. It's honestly really good for someone like me, I don't have very many friends, but it's been very heartwarming to have animal friends in my game. I have heard that Animal Crossing was originally started as a way to cope with loneliness, and I think it does it's job well. There are also many silly and fun things to discover within the game, creative outlets, and building aspects, that make the game very relaxing and rewarding."
96,TwistedCritic,"Mar 14, 2016",10,"Now, this game isn't for most people. If you think a routine of ""collect, sell, improve house"" is boring, this isn't for you. If you don't like cutesy style games, this isn't for you. I however, love it. It's great fun, it's relaxing, and a good break from those typical gore fests. It's got a great level of customization, and you can play with friends, manage a town, and do other little activities to keep you occupied. It's great!"
97,Tbonedabeasst,"Jan 4, 2016",9,"This game is a great game to pick up for a few minutes and play while taking a break from games like fallout 4 and Fire emblem Awakening.

It is a cute and relaxing game where your the mayor of your own town. you can build public works projects, dig up fossils, collect fruit, and so much more."
98,ericwithcheese,"Nov 11, 2015",10,"I have always loved Animal Crossing, but New Leaf is where I feel the franchise really came into its own.  Giving you the additional power as Mayor where you can create ordinances and unique items and designs for your town is an ingenious twist, while characters like Isabelle have quickly become among my favorite in the series.  As with any AC game, you do eventually run out of things to do when played long enough, but it is an endearing journey, and one of my favorite games of all time."
99,GAMERGUY25,"Sep 17, 2015",10,"Animal Crossing New Leaf for the 3DS is one of its premiere titles.

For the first time in series history you are the mayor of your town. You can issue ordinances, Build public works projects and change various things such as the town tune and flag. The projects you build are very unique and can help your town in many ways. From benches and bridges to a coffee shop and police station. Of course you cant have an animal crossing game without animals and every one can live in your town old favorites and newcomers alike can join you and friends via multiplayer for the definitive animal crossing game only on 3DS"
100,Ayana,"Aug 24, 2015",10,"Animal Crossing New Leaf is an enjoyable and adorable game, mimicking real life actions and routines, with fun, and creative fictional animal based-characters to interact and talk with. It's an addicting game and is for every age; without including violence."
101,kiwikelly,"Aug 2, 2015",9,"The beginning is pretty long and you can get bored then because you barely have any fruit to sell, so I suggest planting new trees as soon as you get into the game. As it goes on, it becomes really fun.
I love the Roost Café, such a fun addition, they should've added a bakery as well!
Sometimes you run out of things to do but you can always earn bells by fishing, catching bugs and picking all of the fruits. Some villagers might ask you to deliver something.
It's fun to get back to, I tend to be addicted, then quit for a while, then check up on it and find myself playing for hours again. I used to have Wild World and City Folk as well and the series only get better!"

107,thebeautydeb,"Feb 16, 2015",1,"I know Nintendo DSes don't have many good game options so people got crazy over this game because it's different from most and has more to it than the first Animal Crossing, but I can't give into the hype. Honestly this game made me feel like I was playing a game meant for a 5 to 10 year old. Collect fruit, shells, and fish for money. Upgrade house, build bridges, do ridiculously easy favors like give a present to someone in exchange for a t-shirt, dig holes, catch bugs, send letters.. After just a week of playing this game, I was sick of the boring tasks I had to do repeatedly for dosh. I didn't feel like there were any difficult missions or game structure. I know there's more to it when you get deeper into the game but I couldn't tolerate how slow moving it was and the lack of things to do at night. Fantasy Life and Rune Factory 4 basically has the same things included in this game along with in depth missions and hours and hours of gameplay that is enjoyable. A few hours pass by and you're like wow I didn't realize. In Animal Crossing, I struggled to play for more than 30 minutes at a time, I lost interest easily. If you're in the younger crowd, this is for you."
108,imoses,"Jan 26, 2015",10,"I have logged 440+ hours on Animal Crossing: New Leaf! It is AC at its best, I have played all AC games to date.

Pros:
+ You're the mayor this time!
+ Animals and their personalities
+ Fish, fossil, furniture collecting OCD!
+ customize town
+ Real time = extension of own life
+ mini-games
+ visiting other towns
+ streetpass integration

Cons:
- friend codes still a thing
- repeating dialogue
- flat terrain (compared to previous installments)"
109,DBPirate1129,"Jan 11, 2015",10,"I was expecting great things when I popped in my first ever Animal Crossing game into my 3DS for the first time! Was I disappointed? Of course not!

The game's incredibly addictive and you'll find yourself playing it for months on end. There's just so much to see and do here. You can go to Main Street and buy some clothes or donate fossils, fish, and bugs to the museum or you can go to the Roost to get coffee (or make coffee for your villagers) and much more! I've never played a game where I've never got bored: this game is the first!

The villagers/animals in the game make you feel much more engaged with the experience. They all have a unique personality (boys have four available personalities and girls have also have four available personalities), making it easy to connect with them. Of course, I do have my favorite (boy-smug, girl-normal) but the fact that you like some villagers more than others shows that each one is different.

Tortimer Island is a fantastic addition to the game. Without it there'd probably be a lot less fish and bugs to collect. Therefore, Tortimer Island is one of the reasons the game has so much replayability. The tours (or minigames) featured at the island are very fun even if some of them are a bit more confusing than others. Tortimer Island probably would've been a lot more fun if I hadn't cut down all the trees there but that's my own fault...

Your home plays a big part in the game. You can upgrade it via Nook's shop, get points on it via the Happy Home Academy, and get ideas for it via Happy Home Showcase. I personally was so busy with other things to worry about my house but it's a much needed addition. The Happy Home Showcase was really fun to look at, though, as you could buy furniture from other people's houses straight from it!

New to the Animal Crossing series is your responsibility of being a mayor. Namely, you can make ordinances (make things lower priced, make the town look better, etc.) and make public works projects. These public works projects are a huge responsibility in the game. Without these, you can't add the Dream Suite (in which you can visit other players' towns via dream) or the Reset Center (Mr. Resetti, the boss of the Reset Center, will scold you for not saving). The whole mayor thing is like turning a new leaf! (pun intended)

Holidays also play a big role in the game. While in the grand scope of things, there aren't much holidays, when they do come around they're a big deal: especially Toy Day (Animal Crossing equivalent of Christmas). You have to learn what every single villager wants for Toy Day as when the holiday occurs, you have to play the role of Santa! It's a big undertaking, but it's all worth it! Other holidays include Bunny Day (Easter), Festivale (made up for this), and Halloween.

Overall, Animal Crossing: New Leaf is a fantastic game and it's one of the best I've ever played. It's incredibly addictive and for good reason. The amount of replayability in the game is astounding!"
110,EPICNANMAN,"Jan 3, 2015",9,"this was my first AC game so i did not expect much i got it day one little did i know it was probably one of the best 3ds hits of all time your a mayor of a town the towns name you decide (i named mine hyrule) when you get off the train you decide where you wanna build your house er a tent but with patience it will become a lot better when you start off  theres one shop in town going to the shopping district theres only a few places to go like the bank the museum   and 2 other shops but there will be more like Kicks run by...kicks a flower shop the t&t shop will expand and club lol and more later you'll see the original mayor who gives you boat rides for 1,000 bells theres multiplayer and even EASTER EGGS!"
111,Enchantedsloth,"Dec 7, 2014",10,"This game is great! It's really improved itself from its Wii and DS counterparts. This game is vibrant and fun, and also quite relaxing. The addition to the new characters are wonderful, and also the addition of the House Renovation shop and the island. The whole game just leaves you feeling at peace, and it's just such a nice addition to the Animal Crossing series. I can't wait to see what they do next."
112,Jje261,"Nov 30, 2014",9,"A wonderful game. From someone who hasn't played the other ones, makes me want to play them. This so far is one of my favorite 3DS game. Only thing I don't like is that In the begging, It makes you wait for a  pretty long time for things to get ""interesting"". But If you can get over that, this game will keep you entertain for a LONG TIME"

114,aasecr14,"Nov 18, 2014",10,"I played Animal Crossing: Wild World for the old DS, so I was pumped when I heard about the new one. The first thing I noticed when I popped the game in was that it was gorgeous. The second thing I noticed was that it was one of the most engaging games I've ever played. The way the game is set up forces you to care about your villagers and their problems. And the best/worst part about it is that there is a limited amount of things to do each day, so it's almost impossible to play this game for more than 45 minutes a day. I have over 100 hours on this game and plan to restart my town and get 100 more. Amazing game."
115,LaraR,"Nov 17, 2014",9,"Now that I reflect on how much time I spent on this game, I'm surprised I haven't gotten all the badges yet. Besides that, I love this game! I have played less lately but I enjoyed the phase I had being addicted to this game. I will still cherish the time some random stranger at that island gave me a million bells. I highly recommend this game and who knows, you might just be as lucky as me!"
116,saxo27,"Nov 12, 2014",9,"Animal Crossing is an example of a simple game that is simply enjoyable. The art style is quaint, bright and cheerful. The characters are fun and memorable. It is truely a quintessential Nintendo game and displays the creativity and uniqeness that Nintendo brings to the gaming industry. Yes, the game can be a bit slow and is not too enjoyable to play for hours at a time. However, for how simply the game is--it is quietly dynamic. Every day brings something new and fun to do. Every week brings a new surprise (like a lost sailor, an art dealer selling potential conterfits, a DJ, and more). Even every month can potentially bring a new surprise with new animals moving into your town, a holiday or a specifical event. Again, this game possess a quiet dynamism coupled with a cheerful art scheme and charming characters and charming activities to partake in. Enjoy."
117,Komrath,"Oct 22, 2014",10,"It is my first Animal Crossing game and it's absolutely fantastic :-) It's like a ""free to play"" game, without the micro-transactions, really charming and heartwarming. You decide on how much you want to spend with the game, but I already scored over 70 hours in around a month, there's always something to do: take care of fruit trees, plant and water flowers, collect shells, visit other gamers, have mini parties with your villagers, who are cute and silly and funny. It's a great game to play when you don't want to save the world another time, or you just want to do something positive, since you can never loose in this game, every villager tells you how awesome you are, and in general this game makes you feel great about life and yourself."
118,danech10,"Oct 14, 2014",8,"This is, by far, the best Animal Crossing in terms of gameplay refinement, features, and design. There's more stuff to do in your town, more ways to customize it, more stuff on main street, and it's all easier and more fluid thanks to a lot of thoughtful streamlining that removes so much of the tedium present in earlier entries of the series.

My biggest problem with the game, really my only problem, and ultimately the reason why I stopped playing so soon, was that so much of the charm that made this series unique is gone. The characters all just feel so bland and samey, with none of that zany sharpness or bite in their dialogue that made you care about them in earlier games.

I definitely think the gameplay improvements and innovations are necessary to keep a series like this relevant and to allow it to grow into potentially something bigger, I just hope that if/when that does happen, it doesn't lose touch with what made it so special in the first place: charm."
119,Rainbowhusky,"Sep 18, 2014",10,This is one of my favourite games on my 3ds and I love it! Everything is perfect and it has a very cute charm to it! If your new to ACNL and love to customize things then this is a perfect game for you!
120,SwitSwat,"Sep 3, 2014",8,"I will come out and say it straight that the Animal Crossing series is pretty pointless... WAIT, DON'T KILL ME. Let me explain. Admit it, there is no real goal to this game which makes the whole thing pretty pointless... BUT, it doesn't mean that it isn't enjoyable. The game has plenty to offer and plays smoother than previous titles in the series. Fishing and decorating houses has never been more fun! - But in all seriousness, it's a well made 4th installment. My one complaint? Only one person can be mayor. I mean, why couldn't they have made it where you can have multiple towns with multiple mayors? Still, it's a great casual title and it makes for a very attractive 3DS game for many. 8/10"
121,sonicheroes123,"Aug 23, 2014",8,This game is fun you should pick it up for your 3DS 2DS or 3DS XL. Teh game starts up with u choosing the name for your town and when u enter your town and there are randomly picked people in teh town.
122,murdock6,"Jul 17, 2014",10,"Just a simple, relaxing video game that will definitely keep you entertained for hours on end. A game that is meant to be enjoyed at your own pace.

123,reviewmatt,"Jul 14, 2014",9,"A Great game. You can make your town your little paradise, build an awesome house, go to an tropical island resort, play with friends and more. Fun is a thing that this is full of!
Unfortunately, there is 1 flaw. That is that even though it's fun, it gets boring so you might be taking breaks from the game.

124,daversss00,"Jul 6, 2014",10,"This game is the gateway to your new life, and what a great life it is! This insanely addicting game is well worth any price you can find for it. This was my first version and I was still immediately **** into the charm of my villagers even when I didn't know what to do. This is one of the few video games I can think of where I always smile or laugh at all the witty banter and puns that they can come up with. This game has a completely INSANE amount of content, and is meant to be digested in little bursts daily, unlike others where you would want to spree for a week or two. Probably what I most like about New Leaf though is how it never ends, I got my copy for Christmas and I never want to stop playing. Another win for New Leaf is how it makes you care about all your villagers. Whenever I accidentally forgot about meeting them I felt bad for them and wanted to do something to make them feel better. I cannot recommend this game enough, it is a 3ds must have, and you won't regret picking it up."
125,theecakee,"Jun 6, 2014",8,"First Animal Crossing I played, I'd really give this a 7.5 because I can't decide between a 7 or an 8. Game was pretty fun, but I did not find it as addicting as everyone claims. It was fun for a week or two, then it just got a little more like a hassle with no real direction and dull."

127,Ernste,"May 13, 2014",7,"A good game for sure even without a proper story line.
Reason  to buy this game.
-When you saving money to buy something
-When you saving money to build something
-When you play online
-When you play with your friends and do stupid things together
-When you decorate your house

Boring when playing the game.
-When you try to save your money (you have to repeat the same progress) like training level in pokemon game
-When you completed everything (even you can play online , but you will get bored eventually)
-When none of your friend can play this game together with you
-When playing with someone you don't know make you feel troublesome
-When you are a boy but see a beautiful girl dress/ you are a girl but see a cool boy clothe (using female character may better for me ~.0  ,because man clothe is suitable for girl character too)
-When someone keep calling you to open your gate when you in the middle of saving money(especially early game)

OVERALL
-Great game +
-no story -
-I WOULD RECOMMEND THE GAME FOR YOU (especially your friend own a 3ds)"
128,goopyGoop,"May 9, 2014",9,"They have greatly improved this game since the Animal Crossing Wild World, it's much more complete and fun. You have much more freedom. It's very fun I would recommend buying it. :)"
129,Ferdinel,"Apr 6, 2014",8,"So, I start the game on a train with a guy trying to interrogate me in order to let the game figure out how things should be set up at the start.  Ok, nothing too weird there, but then I get off the train and everybody tells me I am their mayor now and will not take no for an answer.  Even better, they are all furries so I am apparently in the wrong world.  Why did it have to be furries?...I keep telling them I never agreed to this but they acted like they can not understand me and begged me to lead them so I eventually said Sod It and went to some tree planting ceremony to take the role as mayor after all.  I am told I need to scrounge up $10000 for a down payment on a house by pawning off whatever I find laying around the area to stores that make a good living off our hard work harnessing the natural resources of this area and this is the only way the unemployed majority are allowed to make money, I keep being told to do a bunch of mundane things at the mayor's office at first and then finally after a couple of days and receiving a letter saying ""I am too busy doing things so you are the new mayor now -Keep it a secret"" the secretary gets around to telling me I actually have duties, the people have a very low opinion of me, people think the town **** and I have to earn the approval of people while pawning off random stuff to try to save the money for the home down payment.  I also am immediately told the area is not green enough.  The area is a forest with a few cottages for crissakes, how can it get any greener than that?  And it gets weirder from there.  A duck said ""Fishing for ducks? You are gonna need some exquisite bait"" (was that a **** reference?), an obviously male reptilian asked me to give him a makeup kit (wtf?) and a flower suddenly gave birth to another fully grown flower with a plopping sound (which I assume is anatomically impossible), then I find out nobody maintains the area and I am expected to water small plants and do the weeding on top of everything else.  Boy, if this were real life I would be getting the hell out of town.

Hilarious review aside, this is a good sandbox game and the occasional weirdness that can occur only adds to it..  You can follow recommendations or set your own goals, it starts out ok but as time goes on and you interact with characters and meet certain conditions more things to see and do become available and you can eventually make the town your own.  According to what I read there are also seasonal events and after you reach a certain criteria a few dozen mini games become available for you to enjoy.  This game is definitely worth getting if you are a fan of the Animal Crossing series."
130,KCritic,"Apr 3, 2014",10,"My girlfriend played this game, and I wasn't so sold on it. Though, as I watched her play it wasn't long until I fell in love with its charming world, characters, music and gameplay. New Leaf is a truly unique game which I not only now own myself, but have sunk almost 200 hours into. One of the most addictive games ever, be warned."
131,DrewtheDude85,"Mar 28, 2014",9,"Before playing New Leaf, the only experience I've had with Animal Crossing was the original on the GameCube and while I enjoyed the original, I was completely blown away from this game. I was addicted to this game since day one, there was lots to do and the game changes as time goes on which is both good and bad in a way. It's good because it gives you things to look forward to, but it was also bad for me mainly because I would get a bit impatient to see what happens next to the point of where I would start playing early in the morning. But there was plenty of activity to do and I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who has a Nintendo 3ds or 2ds. If you are only going to buy one animal crossing game, then let it be Animal Crossing: New Leaf."
132,Doodahday66,"Mar 24, 2014",9,"Animal crossing never fails to disappoint, the New Leaf for the 3DS is much smoother, graphically beautiful and diverse than Wild World was on the original DS. The gameplay mechanic of being the mayor has much to improve upon, but it has made a start none the less. I do feel this game could do better with exclusive events and DLC, as to me, the game does kind of get boring, slow and even tedious as you start to expand your house to the point where it costs hundreds of thousands of bells..."
133,CurlyFryGamer,"Mar 23, 2014",9,As I am new to the Animal Crossing series I probably haven't got much say in this debate but since I got it at Christmas 2013 I would say it's a must buy for the Nintendo 3DS with it's layed back nature and  simplistic objectives it's a very nice game to kick back and relax to. My only complaint is that maybe they could have added more Mini Games other than the Island games and also it's VERY addictive living your life just waiting for what wonders in the next day.
134,ReviewScope,"Mar 13, 2014",6,"Animal Crossing: New Leaf does show some promise, but it can fade away after a while

Pros:
Full of charm
The experience can be relaxing

Cons:
Most parts of the game can be tedious

If you are a huge animal crossing fan, try this out, but if you are a newcomer, only play this if its what you strongly desire.  It can last a reasonable amount of time, but it may start to fade away after a while"

136,Moooo,"Feb 21, 2014",9,"This game improves upon the other games in the series in almost every way. You can do so much in this game, there is no way I could say everything you can do in this review. There is an absolute ton of stuff to do in this game. I've been playing for about 90 hours now, and I'm not even halfway done. You are the mayor of a town. You can add new buildings and maintain the town through town projects and ordinances, trying to get a perfect town rating. There are 60 things you can add in the town, ranging from a cafe to the Sphinx. All of this is new to the series. My only complaint is the villagers have to tell you about 40 town projects (you start out with about 20) before you can build them. That would be fine, if they would just tell you them about 2-4 times a week. Instead, you will be lucky to get 1 in a week. Overall, I think the tiny flaws in this game can easily be overlooked and this game could become one of your most played games ever due to the amount of content in it."
137,rhaynes7,"Feb 11, 2014",9,"I went through the GC and the DS versions, and I was pretty sure I was never going to do it again.  In fact, my brother got the Wii version, but I quickly lost interest.  However, when I saw that you were now the mayor and ruler of your own city, my curiosity was piqued, and I decided to give Animal Crossing one last go.

It's nice that they finally changed the initial set up of the game.  You're starting place, is a tent, and your goal is a mansion.  However, throwing in the concept of being town mayor affords you better control of personalizing your town.  The graphics are much improved and the 3D allows things to pop.  As with any good expansion, there's more of everything to do.

StreetPass affords some excellent functionality.  I love running through people's homes or dream town and laying waste to their city cause I can, knowing there's no consequences.  Buying their furniture and seeing the incredible things people can do inspires you to come up with ideas for your own ultimate town.

However, after awhile, I hit the rut again, and the realization comes that I've played this game twice before.  Animal Crossing New Leaf is still essentially the same game.  It's just as enjoyable, if not better with all the improvements, but I guess I had imagined that holding the position as mayor could afford me more power.  Oh well.  It's just sad to know that my town is running destitute with weeds now, and few games hold that attachment for me.  I simply wish it would make it easier to pull away and to know my town isn't to falling apart.  This game just shows me I have deep commitment issues.  Until a few more installments down the road, I bid you adieu ACNL."
138,PolisKanin,"Feb 7, 2014",9,"Animal Crossing New Leaf takes the fun of the previous games in the series, and adds new and innovative features. In this instalment, you become the mayor of the town, which means there is a lot more freedom and activities to do in the game. The game is fun and relaxing, so it is not for everyone, but most people can   get lost in the game and spend hours playing it."
139,Aozz101x,"Jan 29, 2014",9,"Animal Crossing New Leaf is one of the best 3DS games that i enjoy playing

140,EvilChicken,"Jan 26, 2014",10,"CONTENT!!
There is so much to do on this game! The only other one i have played is the original, but i love this one. You can get all your fruits and shells and sell them to get bells to customize your home and do projects as the mayor. If your bored of that, you can go to an island and do fun games with the previous mayor.
I strongly recommend this game."
141,bobbyman46,"Jan 13, 2014",9,Incredible fun and super addictive. You'll find yourself playing this game all the time everyday because of its fun and easy to do game play. It's a nice game to sit and relax to.
142,Cerenzio,"Jan 10, 2014",10,"The best AC by FAR. This is NOT Wild World, or City Folk. NEW LEAF has so much more content, it is ridiculous. I've got 180 hours logged, and new things are still opening up. It may look similar, but, it's FAR superior. Also, the touch screen is a god-send, as is the new ability to bundle fruit into baskets of 9. Grab some friends and visit the Island. It's one of many cool new additions."
143,Megg,"Dec 27, 2013",10,I'm addicted to this game. It's cute and funny and there are a infinite possibilities. I have played the other version but New Leaf is 100 times better! I also like the fact that you're in control but not so much as you don't have time to do anything. (Like talk to the animals or earn money.) I also think the animals are friendlier than they were on the previous version. It's an amazing game and I know that even though I've had it for 2 days because it's so action packed.
144,Dcoy,"Dec 21, 2013",9,I am willing to give this game a 10 because not only is it extremely relaxing it may look childish but it has hundreds of hours and things  to do. I can safely say this game is a game you must buy if you own a 3ds in fact it was the first game I got when I bought it and I have not had doubts about it since. The music is very nice while being relaxing and there is stuff to do every day.
145,Lokathor,"Dec 17, 2013",4,"For being the fourth entry in the series, the game hasn't advanced much since the first one. You're the mayor of town in this one, which lets you setup Public Works Projects. They're decorations for your town, and they let you customize how your town is. Except you can only make 30 of them, even though there's space for tons and tons of them. Also, the selection of public projects is mostly limited to things like lamps and benches and statues. You can build up to three bridges across your town's river, but you can't divert the river, you can't add a pond or fill in a pond, you can't add or remove a ramp down to the beach. When villagers move in, they just move in any old place that fits, you can't declare where house lots should go. What I'm saying is that, for a game that tries to sell you on the point of being able to customize your town, you don't get access to a lot of very obvious customization options.

Houses are about the same as before. You can change the outside of your house some, and you can get several rooms inside of your house. All rooms start off at 4x4, then have a 6x6 and 8x8 upgrade you can buy. Always a central room, a room left, back, and right, and an upstairs and downstairs. You can't re-arrange the orientation of your house's rooms, like having it be a long ranch-style house or a tower house where you just stack it five floors high. Even if the exterior didn't change to match it, it would have been nice for your house's rooms to be arrangable.

Of course there's a ton of goodies to put inside of your house, wallpapers, floors, beds, chairs, etc, etc. Once you've picked up an item once, it goes into your catalog, so you can buy it again from Nook's if you sell or lose it. Except some items are ""special event"" items, so you can't re-purcahse them from your catalog. It'll show the item, and then not let you buy it. Not being able to just buy anything in your catalog is pretty poop.

There's a ""Mall"" section, behind your main town, and you can upgrade it a bit. Re-Tail is in the main area, but all the rest of the stores, and the Museum and Post Office, are in the Mall area. Behind the Mall is the Happy Home section, where the houses of people you Street Pass are displayed, and you can order items that you see in their home. It follows the same rules as the catalog though, so if they have a limited item then you can't order it. Which is, again, poop.

The villagers in town are kinda alright, some of them are fun characters that I really like (Ken and Bruce). Except they're a little shallow. You interact with them or not, and based on that they'll usually stay in town. If they decide to move, you can tell them to stay, and they'll stay if you've interacted with them a lot. I say ""interact"" instead of ""be nice to"" because it doesn't matter what your interaction is. You can talk to them, send them letters, hit them with a net, push them into pit-falls, whatever. It's all the same to them.

They each start off with a house customized to them when they move into town, but they don't have any sort of style as to what things get replaced with what, so they'll just use anything you give them and anything they see in Re-Tail. Their houses end up looking like weird mish-mashes of all sorts of styles at once. The villagers aren't very distinct in how they act in general. Internally, the game itself has like 6 general personality types, and it kinda shows through even without knowing that. There's apparently 110 or so villagers in the game, but you can only have up to 10 in your town at once. It'd probably have been better for them to make fewer villagers that are each more distinct.

I guess what I'm getting at in general is that the game has stuff in it, but most of the options are kinda shallow or surface or whatever you wanna call it. There's not many systems driven interactions going on, and the game regularly feels like a disappointment and an ""if only they had"" sort ****."
146,asfj,"Dec 9, 2013",8,"I admit this game is a First-Class, but corresponding to real-time destroyed the game for me.
I don't want to play a game as daily routine. I just want to enjoy a game several weeks in a holiday. Ok, you say using Time-Traveling, but I just feel utterly annoyed when I have to quit game frequently to reset system time.
If there is a machnism within the game for player to adjust time, I will give the game a 9..with no doubt."
147,graccy99,"Dec 4, 2013",10,"This game is by far the best in the series. The mechanics of the game are much better. The controls feel smoother, the gameplay makes perfect sense, and most **** makes you want to keep playing all the time. This game is great for both kids and adults. There is something about the game that just so addicting and you definitely get your money's worth."
148,CptThreepwood,"Nov 21, 2013",9,"This is my first Animal Crossing game and I really enjoy playing it. As someone who usually likes to play storytelling adventures, I was a bit sceptical towards AC:NL, but it did only take minutes of playing to fall in love with it.  Everything is well designed and it is really amusing to interact with all those little weird animals living in your small town. The minigames (especially while playing them with friends)  are also really fun and don't take a lot of time. The only small minus point for me is, that you can reach a point each day where you just can't do any more stuff without ""cheating"" and changing the the time in the Nintendo 3DS setups. It takes hours to reach this point, but as a long time gamer that can be frustrating."
149,Falcus,"Nov 17, 2013",6,"Okay, first of all this game was much too hyped about. This I'm going to keep short.

This game is great for a fan of the series, since it's not too much different than the other Animal Crossing games. Unless you're someone who likes spending hours on end collecting stuff to build your virtual town, not given any specific goal really, then this game eventually becomes rather pointless and boring.

Starting your virtual town is fun  there's lots to do, and everything happens at your own pace. But once you've played for a while, you tire of the repetitive cycle that you go through every day, and everything seems mundane. It doesn't help that everything's in real time, so unless you want to constantly switch your time and date, you have to wait real time for new seasons, new events. And I don't know about you, but changing the time takes any bit of fun away for me.

The game's visuals are alright, definitely nice for an Animal Crossing game. The characters never **** ALL, so if you like RPGs then you probably won't like this game. Not to mention the citizens that live in your town are ANNOYING. The game is quite slow to load and save, and even though you're the mayor, your power is very limited. The interface is nice, but doing anything requires a lot of time, and it's in this time that you start to wonder ""why am I even doing this?""

In short, the game will hook you, but you'll eventually break out of the cycle and just stop... until the next big event comes along. So it's not exactly a game I'd call ""fun."" I can't say much against it, other than my own opinion, because it's been well received. I guess I'm just the odd one out who doesn't understand the core concepts of the series well enough. New Leaf is as cute as games get, but ultimately repetitive and futile.

151,ThePatronGamer,"Nov 5, 2013",7,"This game is just AC: Wild World with a few more features and  3D capabilities. I was struck by nostalgia, but it was not enough for me to have total enjoyment of this game. I felt like it did not offer a sustained amount of game play, just 20 minute increments a day. You need an active friend group to fully enjoy this game."
152,epicdude12302,"Nov 5, 2013",10,"I used to own wild world for my 3ds and it bored me after about a month. this game is not like that. there are actually goals in this game and things to do. it never bores you since there are different things to do every day like checking stores(they change stock every day. a new feature I like is the island you can play mini games) I would recommend this game to everyone. I also like how the game runs on real time so it's not like the stores are open24/7. there's always different events and there are even projects that you can build. you can also renovate the exterior of your home. the graphics and 3d are great and the street pass feature is put to good use. when you street pass with another acnl owner you can view their house and even order stuff from it. overall animal crossing new leaf is an exceptional game, most likely the best I've ever played. this game exceeds all of its predecessors and is a must buy for any 3ds owner."
153,Kelphy,"Nov 5, 2013",9,"I personally did not have high expectations for this game, but this game exceeded the levels of greatness. The characters somewhat sometimes feel repetitive as far as dialogue is concerned.
After dark the game can become quite boring, but this is what Animal Crossing is all about. A world where your little animals seem alive even when not playing.

Superb."
154,LilD,"Nov 1, 2013",8,"If you've never played an Animal Crossing game, this game will absolutely blow your mind. I have had just about every Animal Crossing, so I wasn't as impressed. My overall sentiment is that there is just ""more"" than there being any radical additions. While becoming the mayor is a drastic change, the ways to make money are almost identical to the previous versions. The iterations of this game have incrementally added things, but New Leaf has been the series' biggest jump. It is what City Folk should have been. One gripe I've had with the series is that it still caters to the morning crowd; if I want to play late at night, I still have to time travel to another day because there just isn't much to do in the late hours. I had played Wild World on the original DS to death, which is probably why this entry is not as amazing as it could have been. I am glad that this series is back on track and heading in a solid direction."
155,BulldogReviews,"Oct 20, 2013",4,"If your a classic traditional Animal Crossing Fan  like me. You may find the game wanders away from the original game. You become the mayor of your chosen town  which strays away from staring from the bottom as in other Animal Crossing titles such as  City Life and Wild World. I felt disappointed with the game and felt the 3D in the game felt as if it was a gimmick.
4/10 Poor       Check Out My other reviews"
156,Pad_Lock,"Oct 15, 2013",9,"Definitely the best Animal Crossing so far. It's really easy to enjoy and relaxing. All the features work how you want them to. A game you can pick up for a few minutes just to kill some time. Although, it would be nice if the shops opened earlier (without having to use Early-Bird Ordinance) and the mayor had more power."
157,ZAVGreviews,"Oct 12, 2013",10,"It's creative, It's cute, It's addictive, It's Animal Crossing and it's back and better than ever on the Nintendo 3DS system. Animal Crossing New Leaf is a life simulation game that has no other real goal than to just enjoy your life amongst your animal neighbors. New Leaf has so many new and amazing features that Animal Crossing fans have been waiting for. The whole catching fish and bugs, digging up fossils, decorating your house, and chatting with your neighbors mechanic is all still there but you're not just a regular citizen in Animal Crossing anymore. You move to the town to find out you have accidentally been mistaken for the new mayor that was supposed to arrive and now, well, you become mayor! As mayor you can do things like set ordinances for your town to follow and set up creations in your town like benches and lighthouses. They mayor mechanic is small but it's a whole lot of fun. But ultimately your still playing Animal Crossing, and tons of new features have been added like an island area, new unique holidays, and tons of new stores that allow you to do and buy an assortment of different things. The Graphics are cute, colorful and are extremely well done, and while the music in the game is done very well, I think I still prefer Wild World and City Folks music a bit more. If you are an Animal Crossing fan who was worried that the new Animal Crossing game was just going to be City Folk with a fresh coat of paint I can tell you that New Leaf is most certainly not that. What it is, is a game that has added so much to the Animal Crossing series that the game will keep you entertained for years. From the fans of the AC series to the people who have never played a game in the franchise, I suggest picking up one of the best 3DS games on the market today, Animal Crossing New Leaf."
158,padako,"Sep 19, 2013",7,"A charming and sometimes fun game that ultimately left me wanting more. I mean, there's a lot to do in this game but you can really only play for a couple of hours a day before you run out of fun activities. You can always farm more bells while waiting for the next day but this gets old fast. It's a solid time waster but a little overrated imo and not as memorable as I had hoped. Being mayor puts you in charge of all the cities building projects and the island tours add some variety but they also get boring pretty quickly. I love Nintendo games but this one just didn't grab me like most do."
159,Dragonitefan56,"Sep 6, 2013",9,"This is my first Animal Crossing game and I have no regrets. This game was basically my summer, giving me lots of things to do everyday, growing my town, gaining the respect of my residents and developing my own house. If I have any issues with this game, is that the chatbox when talking to others is very short. Other than that, everything is so perfect that I don't even notice the little flaws. This game is known to be the best in its series, and I'm not surprised."
160,PurplesGameRoom,"Sep 1, 2013",10,"Really fun game. I just can't stop playing it. The only other game in the series I've played before New Leaf is Wild World,but still,I think this is the best game in the series. I play with my sister and my best friend almost every day. It's really worth money and I think even anyone who doesn't really like video games will like it. 10/10."
161,Chaiyoshnay,"Aug 12, 2013",10,"I have been playing video games all of my life. Every once in a while a game comes along that consumes me. Animal Crossing: New Leaf is one of the best video game experiences you will ever have if you are willing to explore it's hidden depth. It's a well known fact that this game is a little difficult to describe in terms of what makes it so fantastic, so I thought I would try to describe it a little differently than most people in the hope of attracting more people to this wonderful game.

Running my town as Mayor to me is similar to running a business, without ever worrying about failing. You have to work hard for your money and spend it creatively on your town. Earning money in this game is addicting in the way mining is in Mine Craft or Terraria. It's addicting in the way leveling up in an RPG can be. Before you know it, you will be compelled to earn big money on those evenings on the island, catching rare bugs. The compulsion to earn money is insane. Who would have guessed that Fishing and Bug catching could be so addictive?

Every town will look different and expressing your style and wealth is one of the most satisfying aspects to a game that I have ever had.  Your town will continue to evolve, and more and more building options and public work projects become available. Each of the buildings and their upgrades adds new facets to your virtual life. From the incredible amount of customizations to your house, to the insane amount of items, to the equally insane amount of quirky wardrobes; each aesthetic choice can be reflection of your own creativity or you can simply use the themes readily available if you are not feeling creative. I built a movie theater in my house, with surround sound speakers, arcades, candy machines and one of those crane machines you find at any theater. It is my pride and joy. I built a park in my town and it's beautiful.

It's one of those games that I think about as soon as I wake up. What's for sale at all of the numerous stores on main street? What events are taking place? What's happening in my virtual alternate life?There is always something happening in your town. Females beware, this game was definitely designed to appeal to your inner shopper. Yes, there is a shoe store and it's inventory changes daily as with all of the stores.

In a day when almost all of the major game announcements involve guns and violence, Animal Crossing: New Leaf is the diametric opposite of those experiences. It's a laid back and incredibly relaxing game. Take it at your own pace, and just chill out. Sometimes I watch TV, while playing Animal Crossing, and that is one of my favorite things to do now. I have put over 150 hours into the game since launch and I imagine I will put two thousand in by the time it is all said and done. If this appeals to you in any way, go out and buy this game. The social features are fantastic, and the community is very helpful. If you do not have a 3DS, it's about time you bought one. Animal Crossing: New Leaf is Nintendo's new killer app."
162,salamanca,"Aug 12, 2013",9,"Animal Crossing is one of those games you keep coming back to over and over again with each iteration, and you never really know why. In its fourth installment since its Gamecube debut in 2002, it's still one of the freshest, most relaxing, and oddly enough, most addictive game franchises on the market. It's also yet another must-own for anyone who has a 3DS.

The biggest difference between New Leaf and the prior Animal Crossing games is that this time, you are the mayor in your town, and as such, you have the ability to customize and improve your town like never before. If you have the money and you're willing to cough up the dough, you can buy various public works projects that add to the aesthetic of your town: things like streetlights, extra bridges, new shops, a night club, police stations, Resetti's headquarters, and more. In relation to previous installments, everything in New Leaf is much more streamlined. Most of the shops are bunched together in the area north of your town, while several staples from prior entries in the series, like the police station for example, are now public works projects that you can place anywhere in your actual town... after you pay for them of course. The depth of customizing your town will, needless to say, keep you coming back to the game, even after you've paid off the millions of ""Bells"" (the currency in Animal Crossing) it will take to expand your home to its biggest potential.

I honestly can't even begin to explain how much furniture and clothing there is to collect in this game. After playing the game for two months, I still walk into the department store and see something new every time I go in. The sheer amount of items and collectibles will baffle you, and this is yet another aspect of the game that will bring you right back to it.

Much of the New Leaf is business as usual, providing you with the same motivation to meet your neighbors, collect all of the bugs, fish, fossils, etc., and pay off that dang home loan that Tom Nook likes to harass you about. All of it is executed extremely smoothly and intricately, in typical Nintendo form. The visuals are delightful, the music is fairly relaxed, and the 3D effect is pretty good, but it really isn't needed for this kind of game anyway.

Overall Animal Crossing: New Leaf is great fun. It's got a strange alluring quality to it that is unlike any other game out there. Considering all of the gritty and violent realism of many other video games on the market, Animal Crossing is a welcome and delightful detour. Without a doubt, it's a must-own for anyone who owns a 3DS, and is yet another great addition to the 3DS's already extremely impressive library of games."
163,Ron1212,"Aug 9, 2013",10,"At first, the game seems slow, however once you begin to discover new things and elements the game becomes an extremely pleasant experience that you'll look forward to playing every day you wake up."

Animal Crossing has been a staple of Nintendo’s games since it first debuted for the GameCube back in 2001. The newest offering Animal Crossing New Leaf delivers the same addicting gameplay with many new additions to keep you coming back for more.

If you have never played Animal Crossing, the basic idea involves you living and interacting in a small town where the other residents are these adorable animals that want to be your friend. The home you live in is expandable and you can fill it with furniture collections and knickknacks. Your day is spent doing errands for your animal friends, catching bugs and fishing for bells. Because the game is in real time, as you go throughout your day so does the life in the town. Time and seasons change and occasionally there are town events like fishing tournaments or fireworks display.

New Leaf has brought a more extensive and personal touch to the gameplay. Here is just a small list of the many new additions:

The first player who moves into your town gets to be Mayor! Their duties include town ordinances and public works with the ability to spruce up the town with benches, flower clocks and other decorations.
Expansion to the museum with a second floor that allows you to create your own showcase.
New stores including shoes, a coffee shop where you can work part-time, and Club LOL that features nightly entertainment.
Travel by boat to a cute island to play mini games and buy island or mermaid themed furniture.

This is definitely a game for collectors, and as a collector of things, Animal Crossing New Leaf taps into my OCD with gusto! I do recommend checking out the Strategy Guide, either in book form or online, to keep track of your collections. As for the game play, I wish they had added more to the monthly events and happenings since they seem to be on the skimpy side. But even with that tiny complaint,  I still find myself checking in daily with the animals to see if they need anything, going shopping to find out what’s on sale at Nooks and stopping by the Roost café for a cup of coffee made with care by Brewster the pigeon. He knows my preference too, Mocha blend with 2 sugars and a little cream. Aahhh..perfect every time.

A-"
165,camilosanchez16,"Aug 7, 2013",8,"Hasta el momento, es el juego del año en Nintendo 3DS, el mejor calificado y el mas vendido (Solo detrás de TLOU). Este juego se merece la popularidad y notas que esta teniendo, ademas de ser la mejor entrega de toda la serie."
166,buleaaah,"Aug 7, 2013",10,"My first animal crossing game, its very addictive and its very clever how the game work. I cant stop playing this game, its like I have second life in this game and a good life."
167,Exca,"Aug 4, 2013",10,"This is the reason of my 3ds purchase    this game is so addictive .
The world keep ""living""  even when you are not playing  and that is the reason of your desire to play   to see what is happening"
168,Mxdem,"Jul 28, 2013",5,"This is one of the funnest and cutest games you'll ever get to play, collecting it's always interesting, furniture list is huge. Why the 5 then? Well, if you ask me, they forgot to fix some of the major issues on this franchise. First of all, collecting furniture in ferns is nice, but you SHOULD be able to see what you got right from the inventory, also changing anything for your house should have a ""preview"" feature, like buying clothes. Some other details would include having to save your tool before talking or entering a building, you could just walk in with in. Other than that, great game."
169,ZeRo_Bahamut,"Jul 22, 2013",9,"Animal's Crossing: New Leaf is a sort of life simulator game, where time flows just like it does in the real world.

If you ever played an AC game before you know exactly what you're diving into, it's more of the same, only done better!

For the newcomers, this is a game that you play day by day as the year goes by, partaking in events, meeting the locals, relax as you catch fish/bugs and generally just do whatever you feel like, there are lots of goals to accomplish in-game, be it completing the museum with various collectibles or decorating your house to your liking, pay your loan to get expansions to your house or just casually play with friends, there's something for everyone here.

AC: NL brings some major and a lot of minor additions to the game, which ultimately enriches the experience by quite a lot, the biggest major addition tho, is being the mayor of your own little virtual town.

Being the mayor brings in all sorts of extra features, like being able to build town projects and putting ordinances into place. These projects range from building a new bridge over the river to an expansion of the town museum...

A minor addition (but a good one at that) is the ability to play with more people on 1 cartridge/town, this means if you and a friend/girlfriend want to live in the same town this is completely possible, but if your friend/girlfriend does something, this will be reflected the next time you start up the game for your character.

All in all, Animals Crossing: New Leaf has something for everyone and when you find time to invest in it, you can play for months to come, it's not for people looking for a fast and action paced game, it's something you need to do a few minutes/hours a day while relaxing and enjoying your ever growing/evolving town."
170,asjklasjklas,"Jul 21, 2013",9,"For any doubters and outsiders of the Animal Crossing fandom, there is nothing new that'll change your minds. However, for veterans of one of Nintendo's cutest franchises, it is the finest installment to date. In the creative department, while players are finally offered the ability to choose the layout of their town at the beginning of the game and given chances to build on to their towns with a slew of scenery and shops, the mayor role in the game is very underwhelming and you'll often grow irritated with having a puppy dog (spoiler: your secretary named Isabelle) tell you what to do 24/7. But outside of that minor struggles, New Leaf refines and adds beyond everything that made the game addictive in the first place, taking even more of the time of your day to simply grow plants, catch bugs and fish, go to the tropical island and play mini-games, play with your friends via Wi-Fi connection, etc. Truly one of the funnest games on the Nintendo 3DS at the moment."
171,JP97,"Jul 21, 2013",10,"As an avid Animal Crossing fan for 10 years, I remember the beauty and joy of playing AC on the GameCube. Sadly, that originality slowly diminished over the years as the DS and Wii versions were basically a copy of each other. But this completely changed with New Leaf. It brought back that amazing feeling the original gave me. Unlike most video games, where you binge through the story until you beat it after a week, New Leaf is made to be played for an hour or less a day, every day, for months. I have had my copy of this game for over a month, and i've played it every day. It's sad to say that i've spent over 100 hours on it already. Actually no, i'm fine with saying that, because this game is truly wonderful. It truly is an endless game, there are new things to do every day and there's always something to look forward to; like paying off your next mortgage, starting a new public works project, or celebrating holidays by getting exclusive furniture. What also makes New Leaf a hit is the much better online play. In previous version, connecting with people was a hassle. This is because Animal Crossing was behind it's time, it was really hard to find new people to play with online back in 2005. But now with bustling AC communities on the internet, getting friend codes is so easy. Overall, this game will give you an experience unlike any other. If you don't have this game and you have a 3DS, go out and buy it right now."
172,baconbrain234,"Jul 21, 2013",10,I have logged hours and hours into this game and have found no flaws at all. It is just amazing to find a game that can **** you in and not let you go for days and weeks on end.
173,danielneves,"Jul 20, 2013",10,"I have tried Wii and Nintendo DS' games but none of them captured me. I saw lots of trailers and critics and them I decided to buy.

The game is SO GREAT, it has lots of content and so many things to do! It's very refined with great graphics and rich soundtrack. The game has lots of ways to connect with friends through online visits real time in your city, local and also streetpass. They enabled a chat to talk to friends in diferents cities. I have never spent so many time playing a game as I'm doing with Animal Crossing New Leaf."
174,Shaggy88,"Jul 17, 2013",10,"For quite some time, I had almost lost hope on the Animal Crossing franchise. They were all good, but it seemed like they were gradually regressing...until New Leaf came out. Now, you are the mayor of the town, and can construct public works projects seemingly wherever you want. You can construct the town any way you like. Easily a game you can get lost in, take my word."
175,MOHAMMAD0203,"Jul 14, 2013",9,"This is the first Nintendo 3DS game I felt like it was 40$ well spent.This game adds so much to the animal crossing series from all the new shops, the new clothing items, the tropical island  and the high level of **** yourself a favor and go buy yourself this game.9/10"
176,pocky,"Jul 13, 2013",10,"A fantastic slice of life game that you can dip into a little every day for months. Great characters and charm, the music is fantastic and the customization is great, if albeit hid behind unlocking. Only criticism is that you can only store 10 designs on your character, but you can make an alt to get more so it's not that big of a problem."
177,MrZanctum,"Jul 10, 2013",9,"I have never been the biggest Animal Crossing fan.  I usually find the games boring and repetitive.  But, I decided to pick up this new Animal Crossing game and something about changed my whole view on the series.  All of the things you can do, all of the new features that Nintendo added to this version compared to the DS version.  Animal Crossing New Leaf has so much charm.  All of the characters consistently make me smile and laugh.  Animal Crossing New Leaf has so much depth to it that I could literally sit down and play this game for hours and hours.  This game has changed my view on the Animal Crossing franchise and I will definitely be picking up the next version of Animal Crossing whenever Nintendo decides to make another one.  But this is a game that I will be playing every day until the next Animal Crossing comes out.  The only reason why I didn't give it a 10/10 is that it is still an Animal Crossing game and I can still find it a little boring at some times, but that's just me.  Are you missing out on a great experience if you don't get Animal Crossing New Leaf?  Absolutely!"
178,Svampriket_se,"Jul 10, 2013",10,"What can I say, it's the best game of the year so far. And unless something comes straight from left field and surprises me, it will stay the best game of the year. It's almost impossible to describe this game, and I'm not even entirely sure if it's to be called a game. But there's so much to do, and the reward system is so devilish paced that you get hooked at once. Combined with a cute and cosy feel, it's a game I've played every day since release, and will continue to do so for several months to come."
179,DynamikReviews,"Jul 8, 2013",10,This is my favorite game for the 3ds i have never played a game as addictive and fun as animal crossing the characters are interesting and always have something silly to say. The ways in which tou can upgrade and decorate your house are amazing the possibility's are endless! Plus the game never ends so you will have fun for days to come!
180,Nostalgic9tails,"Jul 7, 2013",10,"A beautiful addition to a wonderful franchise that has meant so much to me since 2002. This was the first time since the GameCube version that I felt the wonder of having a town and so much to do in it. It brings elements of the past 3 releases and adds several more. And this is one instance that the 3D actually improves the experience. Definitely a must buy for anyone with a 3DS or are fans of the series in general. You will not be disappointed, except perhaps by the many sea bass you'll catch."

182,jeff_reviews,"Jul 4, 2013",10,"So addicting that I am constantly changing the time on my 3DS in order to get what I want in the game. Overall, Animal Crossing: New Life is just fun and wonderful to play when bored."
183,Prozilla,"Jul 3, 2013",9,"fiancé loved it, I thought it was alright. She was a fan since the wii version. if you like the wii version you will more than likely love the 3DS version. its not really my cup of tea but I can see how some like it. I gave it a 9 because I feel the developers accomplished what they were going for and gave you more choices. still could use more changes especially if it takes a couple years to make"
184,ORCSandDRAGONS,"Jul 2, 2013",10,"This being my first Animal Crossing experience I had no idea what I was in for. The game is a true gaming gem in this current generation. I never feel cheated or as if this game is being unfair. I have yet to come across one thing that is sub par. Animal Crossing let's you experience an entire living world on your 3DS. New residents move in and on a daily basis items in stores change. You can chose to play it and accomplish quite a bit in a hurried fashion (even go so far to change the clock in the game to speed along some processes), or you can chose to play day by day like a daily ritual. It's a game that anyone can get something out of. I am obsessed. Great job Nintendo!!!"
185,tech101,"Jul 2, 2013",9,What people need to understand when picking up this game is it needs to be played for an hour or 2 a day.  This is the type of game that is rewarding more and more everyday.  I love how you slowly unlock stuff day by day instead of just being able to buy whatever you want upfront.  I play for hours some times i and i don't even know why but i have fun doing it!  Give this game a chance and it could be so rewarding.
186,Carlsdil000,"Jun 29, 2013",9,"I became a fan of the series in late 2004 when I played Animal Crossing on the Nintendo GameCube for the first time. I was fascinated that a game that includes weed picking and seashell hunting as part of the regular gameplay, and wondered how and why I found it to be so strangely addicting. Fast forward almost nine years later and here we have the fourth installment in the series. While it doesn't stray far from the Animal Crossing formula it does add that nostalgic feeling that I feel was lost in the second and third games. You're still in debt to Tom Nook, but it feels less forced. You're still doing chores such as  killing and weed pulling, but now with projects and things to add to your town instead of it being the same forever. Your main street grows and adds on as you continue to play, and you can't help but feel satisfied as you watch your town flourish into something beautiful and completely your own.

If I had to say something negative about this game (or rather something ""less positive"") it would have to be the placement of public works projects. You can almost never place them exactly where you want, and symmetry is very hard to create.   That being said, I definitely recommend this game to anyone. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, and that's ok, but those who have liked the game for sure will fall in love with this one. This is the best one since the GameCube, and in many ways it's even better than that."
187,Rtheom,"Jun 28, 2013",8,"This is a good one to fall asleep to or to play with your kids/significant other when you have a little bit of free time at the end of the day. It's charming, quirky, and fun in a mini-sims sort of way. There's not much to do that takes any sort of mental capacity, but that's not why you play Animal Crossing. You play because it's a nice little vacation from the stupid of the rest of the world.

I do agree that it's a shame you can't play for much more than an hour without completely running out of things to do, and it's reliance on real time rather than some sort of an in-game sleep system is kinda annoying, but like I said, it's not really meant to be something you take up an entire day with. It's a light snack **** to help wind you down. Keep that in mind if you try it. You'll get your money's worth after many weeks of play, not in a handful of sittings."
188,WoodenToaster,"Jun 25, 2013",10,"Pretty much a perfect, relaxing and charming handheld adventure for all ages                                                                                   I had a lot of fun with this installment"
189,monster_meal,"Jun 24, 2013",10,"Thank you Nintendo. I have been so in to Animal Crossing for years.  I was very disappointed when ""City Folk"" ended up being a pretty straightforward port of the DS game.  Finally we have a true successor to the Animal Crossing game.  Whereas I found myself running out of things to do in the old games, I now have all sorts of things to keep me busy.  New furniture, better AI dialogue, all kinds of new features, and a more fleshed out multiplayer offering.  All this, and Streetpass has finally given you a way to see what complete strangers are doing with their town.  I love it."
190,ce111,"Jun 21, 2013",9,"I'm in love with this game! A great improvement from the previous game! Its not a game that you can play for hours in one sitting since you will run out of things to do but that is, in my opinion, part of its charm. I look forward to playing it every day so that I may do new things and continue to improve the town! Also, I find it a refreshing change of pace from many other games out there that are primarily about violence. In this game the most violent thing that happens is getting stung by bees(and thats only if you shake the tree their hive is in so you kind of deserve it...). So whether you are a fan of the series or just want a fun, family friendly game to play, this one is definitely a winner."
191,SuperstarVenom,"Jun 20, 2013",9,"This is the first Animal Crossing I've played, had it for 5 days now and play it virtually every free minute I have. Simple to play and rewarding each day. Fun to play as a family as each profile you create, all live in the same town and contribute to the community. Highly recommended."
192,RyanA,"Jun 19, 2013",8,"This is one of the best 3DS games out there right now, maybe even the best (I personally disliked immorality of having to kill everyone in most of the levels in FE:A). I guess it's true that it is quite similar to the Wii version, but who says this game is worse than the one on the Wii. If this was the first game in the series, my opinion may differ, but overall, it wasn't a bad game. Overall, 8.3/10"
193,cheesum,"Jun 18, 2013",9,"I didn't expect to enjoy this new installment to the AC series, but I tried it regardless. This game is wonderful, there is charm everywhere; from the lines your townies say, to the captions you get when you capture a bug or a fish. As you play the buildings will expand and begin to sell more items, and be open at different times of the day, you can also now enact ""town ordinances"" which can make your townies go to sleep later or earlier, make them pay more attention to keeping your town beautiful, and increase the selling/buying prices of all items in all of the shops. If you truly want to you could play this game all day, every day, but that might get a bit boring. I have had this game for a week and have been playing 3-4 hours every day, and cannot see myself stopping anytime soon. This is definitely one of the best 3DS games currently available."
194,TheMzingReview,"Jun 17, 2013",9,Great game and very addictive. My only gripe is that you cannot delete extra files on the card without erasing your entire memory. Other than that this is a must buy.
195,firecloud42,"Jun 17, 2013",10,"This is the  OF THE YEAR

So I haven't played an Animal Crossing game since GameCube, not because I don't like the series more that I didn't have a Wii till Skyward Sword and by that time I had a lot of catching up to do with Nintendo Wii titles.

The controls are well done and feels the same as the GameCube (don't fix it if it's not broken). The Graphics are great, the detail of the bugs, fish, and squids are awesome. the story is good (you know the classic tail of becoming the mayor and turning into a **** I mean struggling on becoming a great Mayor). the Music is AWESOME, K. K. Strider is a Legend, and the background music makes great atmosphere and can change the mood of the game. And the characters are so well made that you will fall in love (platonicly..well I guess I can only speak for my self there) or grow to hate...Darn you Tom Nook, I'm done with being in debt with you.

I give it a 1000/10 score  and if you're like me and haven't touched an Animal Crossing game in awhile or haven't at all then New Leaf is a great to get back into or start with

what? I'm not a fan boy "
196,lolfactor100,"Jun 15, 2013",9,What a game! From the moment I have started playing till now I have truly enjoyed my time and felt that there was always something to do rather then pay off my loans. It is very refreshing to have animal crossing with just the right amount of new content added. The few thing that bug me personally are easily out weighed by the enjoyment i get from all the other content that has been added. If you were a fan of the original animal crossing then you will love this new one.
197,Rxbadass25,"Jun 15, 2013",10,"I've been a fan of the AC series since the days of the Gamecube and let me say: New Leaf is by far the best in the series!

First of all, I am a firm believer that this game was never truly intended for the main Nintendo consoles; it had ""handheld"" written all over it since the first installment. This game is the most organic-feeling of the lot and the online play is fantastic.

I love how the game is able to stay pretty much the same as it always has been yet is able to add one small thing to the mix and instantly there's hours upon hours of added game play that in no way feels tacked on. For example, the addition of the wetsuit, being the mayor, the addition of pants and shoes, and the tropical getaway are all great/entertaining additions to the game that make it feel like an even bigger world than it already is and makes the game even more addicting.

If you're on the fence about getting this game, don't be. The 3DS has been coming on strong within the last year and this title has just solidified its victory against the Vita. TEHNOUTTATEHN!"
198,Dastrados,"Jun 14, 2013",10,A game u will keep coming back to months after you buy. Every 3ds owner should get this game. Play it for 1-2 hours at  time. This isnt monster hunter where u grind for 5 hours. Its meant to be played gracefully.
199,ldypebsaby,"Jun 14, 2013",8,"If you played the original game on the GameCube or played the DS version a few years back and enjoyed them, you'll have a ball with this game. If you don't like the first games you won't like this game. Game play is still very similar and not many things are new, but it's fun."
200,Poisonthemonkey,"Jun 13, 2013",10,"My first Animal Crossing **** I'm hooked. I'm not usually into games of this type, but I gave it a try because a lot of folks at my office play it and it has multiplayer. The multiplayer on this game is top-notch, for the kind of game it is--nothing like taking a boat ride with three of your friends and running off to go diving, fishing, and scavenger hunting together."
201,Footballpires,"Jun 13, 2013",10,"Absolutley magnificent! I've really enjoyed this game so far, it's so relaxing and fun at the same time, very pretty visuals and a lot of charm! A lot of things to do and the new online modes are very intresting."
202,NintendoJeroen,"Jun 13, 2013",10,This game is truly innovating and worth it's every penny. I never imagined a new game in the series to be equal to Wild World but this game has proven my wrong.
203,EvilShadowX11,"Jun 12, 2013",10,"So much is the same for the old game, but there are so much more things that are new that make this Animal Crossing so much better than the previous entries in the series. So many more interactions with the townspeople, the island, the stores, everything is just 100X better than the old games."
204,LostAnkh,"Jun 11, 2013",8,"Animal Crossing presents a whole new element in this new title, a new idea or in this case, a new role for players to fulfill in their own town, becoming Mayor of ""insert name of your town here"".

In your new role as Mayor, you can manage the town and work on projects that will make your town stand out among others, making this a brand new experience that previous titles have not given. Instead of worrying about Tom Nook's constant loans with the past 3 titles, this game steers it's head to everything else that isn't about bells, the town and the animals that live there. Making the player the Mayor, provides a new role that players can play to further appreciate their hard work by seeing how they helped shape their town, instead of a mere house upgrade.

Of course, more items and furniture have been added, to make the game more personal as previous titles have done. Accessories, hats, glasses, pants (WHOA), shoes, and more clothing truly add to the experience to tailor your character to your liking. With the addition of home exterior decorating, the personalization presented in this game is ever vast.

A very good element in the game, is your secretary, Isabelle. She helps you with your mayor duties and really helps explain the game to newcomers. Talk to her enough, and she'll provide you with necessary information that will help your experience with this game. Plus, she's incredibly adorable (as with many things in this game).

Other improvements are more finishing touches to this finely crafted game in this North American release, adding much needed flexible controls that make the game easier to play. And with Twitter and Tumblr, you can share in-game screenshots of your life in Animal Crossing and keep those memories stamped on social media.

Now, to the things didn't appeal to me, and it may just be the fact that I'm more critical in my current age. The game holds you back from experiencing everything the game has to offer, by only letting you do certain things when you done this or that. While that may add a feeling of progression with rewards, the series has always kept open doors to you. Aside from that, when all the necessities are done and you can move on to the next task, it feels as if the game has nothing for you to do but wander around aimlessly in the night, waiting eagerly for the next day. While you can get certain fish/bugs and talk to your neighbors, those are things you can already do during daytime, and they really needed to populate the night life with things that don't need to be unlocked.

New Leaf is a fantastic entry in this fun and adorable franchise, adding more of what you love about these games, teaching the player more about what she/he can do in this game, improvements to already existing elements, and while the game does hold you back from experiencing everything you can do, there is no doubt that this is an enriching game that you can leisurely play everyday."
205,rowazra,"Jun 11, 2013",10,"This game strikes a perfect balance between the classic freefrom feeling of Animal Crossing with new goals and structures. There is a never a dull moment in this game from the classic hobbies we all know and love to new mayoral duties. New music and new graphics give this game a real boost and brilliance. The game also nails it on the small touches that are so charming and enjoyable they're impossible to adore. They streamlined the game as well, fixing everything that might have bugged you before. The game lets you know when you catch a new fish, let's you do basically everything in bulk, and also gives you a place to sell your things in the village. The animal scripts for the game are so amazing and diverse you wouldn't notice they weren't real unless you hounded the animals to death. They are so much more aware and lively in every way. When I say the game strikes a perfect balance it really does, between structure and freedom, work and play, city and village, familiar and new, this game is exactly what fans have been asking for and is sure to capture the attention and devotion of new players!"
206,KillaRiku,"Jun 11, 2013",10,"Since I bought this game, I've been playing this like I'm addicted. It is the best Animal Crossing. If you liked the GC Version, the NDS Version or the Wii Version, then you will love this game like it's you're own child.
Play it! Love it!"
207,VidsRule,"Jun 11, 2013",7,I can see this will become addictive. If played for an hour a day it could be played for years. But it still feels pretty barren. It has charm but there still isn't enough stuff to do. I don't want to run out after an hour and wait till the next day to play. Fun though.
208,FalloutShadow,"Jun 10, 2013",10,"If your veteran or new to animal crossing then this game is a must to be  in your 3DS library. This game adds enough new fresh stuff like being mayor and such for people
Who are new to animal crossing, and people who loved the previous animal crossing will love this one. Best animal Crossing to date."
209,Autosaver,"Jun 9, 2013",10,"Animal Crossing has gone a long way since the original game. While previous entries have not made any evolutionary turns, this one surely has. The 3DS game is the one that beats them all. Missing out on this game is a great mistake. This is a must have for all 3DS owners."
210,KirkyDaTurkey,"Jun 9, 2013",9,"Based on Day 1, this game is definitely a 9 so far. Could be 10 or could be an 8 depending on what happens over time as I will edit this review. I haven't played AC since the DS like 5 years ago, and this is hands down the PERFECT way to get back in to the series. The little changes have made this fantastic. Being able to get rid of things in groups rather than singles. choosing ANYWHERE you want to place your house in the town. You like that view by the beach? ""Done,"" says Nook. One thing that bothers me is that the curvature of the world is a little too much and zoomed in too far, making it a little annoying to find fish.
I can't wait to see what else this game keeps showing tomorrow, throughout the week, and for months to come!"
211,EFYevan,"Jun 9, 2013",10,"Much different than the previous DS version  I popped in the old game today to see the difference, and ""Animal Crossing: New Leaf"" is so much smoother and better in every way!  The whole game seems happier and Nintendo really listened to its fans.  It may sound silly, but being able to sell all your items at once or have the owl appraise all your items at once saves a ton of time and is so convenient!  No game is perfect, but this is so close!  9.9/10"
212,L0stR3negade,"Jun 9, 2013",9,Refreshing style of game to play. Its hard to frown on it as this game is cheerful and brings joy when being played. Graphically the stands strong to other 3DS titles. The music is calming and the characters a lovable. Customization could have been better but it is in no way bad.
213,46joey_b,"Jun 9, 2013",10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
214,setz,"Jun 9, 2013",10,Finally an AC to dethrone the Gamecube version. This game is so full of charm and makes me constantly smile and laugh. There is no other series I can pick up and play literally ever day for months.
