2,froomie01,"Apr 6, 2024",10,I believe this is the best made animal crossing game. It feels humble and welcoming and is structured in a way that lets the player adventure on there own and make the game feel very rewarding.
3,SnazzySlime,"Mar 4, 2024",9,"The best Animal Crossing. The villagers are fun to talk to, Tortimer Island is fun to play with friends (I wish I had friends). You have the perfect amount of town customization. You can place Buildings and other Public Works Projects, but the town layout is the same. Because you live in this town, you don't control it (coughs in New Horizons). The whole vibe is on point."
4,Luckysoda,"Feb 13, 2024",10,this game is fantastic i remember getting this as my first game for my ds at a garage sale the game has so much to unpack and is extremely fun
5,EmptyPeanut,"Oct 28, 2023",9,best animal crossing so far besides wild world!
6,lostleader,"Oct 26, 2023",10,"New Leaf is an Animal Crossing game that goes above and beyond compared to other installment changes. Everything in New Leaf is a bit newer, a bit bigger, a bit cooler, and a lot more customizable. New Leaf takes expressing yourself in a game to a whole new level and in its own way, making any given town different to any other town out there. New Leaf probably won't get those that hated Animal Crossing before to turn heads, but for those that got bored too easily in the older AC games will find a lot more to do in New Leaf. New Leaf is easily the best in the series, and one of my all time favorite games, and while I have experienced a lot of game, I still have so much more to do still."
7,kup108,"Oct 22, 2023",9,"The best Animal Crossing imo. Perfect map, character-interactions, and gameplay. Wish it had some of the quality-of-life features that New Horizons had tho."
8,Marioipod13,"Oct 21, 2023",5,Well... Maybe I just personally don't like animal crossing. It is too slow and grindy for me.Aside from the excessive grind it's a fun game.
9,leotorol,"Oct 18, 2023",10,This game was awesome it was my childhood game and I just get chills while a listen to the soundtracks 10/10
10,omfgkj,"Jul 21, 2023",10,"The game is amazing! Calm and fun, where you aren't forced to do anything. The characters are lovable, the music fits perfectly, and it's a fun calm game at general."
11,MythicallyLegen,"Apr 8, 2023",9,"I think to this day it’s the best animal crossing game there is. Much was added compared to the previous versions, town was lively and interesting, multiplayer was casual and fun. Only downsides are it can get quite repetitive but thats kinda animal crossing in a nutshell."
12,oopkp,"Apr 1, 2023",10,"FINALLY THEY GOT FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA TO DIRECT AN ANIMAL CROSSING GAME! He made 'em an offer they couldn't refuse and got his spot in the director's seat for the first time since the Godfather Part III (although I've never seen that movie). His influence shines through in every part of the game. First of all, the weeds of Wild World are massively toned down since this game came out 8 years later, meaning there hasn't been as much time for weeds to accumulate in my town. But also, Tom Nook is clearly inspired by crime boss Michael Corleone. Nook's corruption peaks in this entry, as he scams the player with really expensive houses. They also made him have a more sinister personality which I really appreciated. My only problem with this game is that it lost some of the charm that the other games had, but it's still a masterpiece in my eyes."
13,SatinFoil,"Jan 1, 2023",10,"My favorite 3DS game, and most favorite animal crossing game (other then original)! If you have a 3DS, I definitely recommend playing it!"
14,ZangBang,"Oct 24, 2022",4,"45/100
Animal Crossing New Leaf is an immersive experience full of warmth, where the relaxing rhythm of everyday life lulls the player into a state of quietly fulfilling, mundane bliss, surrounded by friendly faces in a charmingly peaceful setting. The villagers are endearingly vibrant and unique thanks to various personality types, even though their presence starts to feel hollow after some time, mainly due to the lack of many meaningful ways to interact with them and a somewhat disappointing amount of lines of dialogue. Nonetheless, the game partially makes up for it through its astonishingly rich customization options. An immense catalogue of clothes to change your appearance, but also countless furniture and hundreds of items to decorate the interior of your house and the landscape of the town as well, not only through the growth of various kinds of trees and flowers, but also projects that vary from small fountains to new facilities hosting new activities. As time passes, new shops and locals will open allowing the player to shop more, access new features and meet new characters. Slowly but surely, players will discover the incredible richness of the decorative and self-expression options the game has to offer, making for a gratifying long-lasting experience. However, as much as it offers an astounding amount of content and a unique atmosphere, the overly simplistic and excruciatingly repetitive nature of the few available activities, namely fishing and catching bugs, leaves New Leaf thriving more off of ambience than actual content."
15,Dairy,"Sep 19, 2022",10,"An absolute masterpiece ****, it has everything an animal crossing game has ever needed, it isn’t watered down like New Horizons, I would say NL is the most balanced in then series feature wise. The music is simply outstanding like 5pm, 7pm, and even the main street theme! Only complaints are grass deterioration, and the lack of other minor special npcs like Frillard, or Serena  but that’s pretty much it. If you have to play only one game in the series it has to be New Leaf."
16,varkaromlu,"Jun 13, 2022",9,"The game was very addicting. I played it for two hours or more a day, everyday, for months. After a while, it gets really repetitive, so I dropped it. But the time I spent on the island was magical, a really great experience."
17,Paperplayer,"Apr 13, 2022",10,To be honest its better than new horizons because of the villagers they have more emotion in this game than the villagers in new horizons but you can't build outside allthough there are items that would look better placed outside but okay I always wanted a steamroller inside my house.
18,Anthony_is_AFK,"Mar 9, 2022",10,"While I may sound like pretty much everyone in the Animal Crossing community, I think this is one of the best AC games, I think the mechanic of being the mayor is one of the best ideas, it really changes the gameplay compared to the games before it. The character customization is great with tons of different options for clothing and tons of new hairstyles (with some of them not even appearing in New Horizons to this day). The UI is easy and simple to understand for new players, and also has that Animal Crossing charm to it of course. The special NPCs are very charming and unique (my personal favorite being Digby), the music is great, and the online is fun. If your thinking about getting an Animal Crossing game soon  would 100% recommend you to pick up a cheap 3DS or 2DS and get this game because it is one of my favorite video games of all time, and I think you should play this if you are interested in playing life simulation games, but speaking of life simulation games, I just want to say Animal Crossing is absolutely nothing like Tomodachi Life, they are completely different games with completely different art styles, gameplay, UI, and controls."
19,albegres,"Feb 5, 2022",9,"89/100
This game has so much charm and is so incredibly relaxing. Animal Crossing is unique in the gaming industry and you need to play it to understand it. At the beginning you might not understand it, but the more you play it the more you enjoy it"
20,MunhozMCM,"Nov 4, 2021",9,"My Score:

(9) - Great!

21,KNX2501,"Jul 17, 2021",8,Es un buen juego sobre todo si disfrutas de realizar pequeñas tareas para pasar el tiempo. Lo recomiendo para jugadores casuales o para aquellos que quieran algo mas relajante.
22,dojarat,"Jun 16, 2021",10,"truly one of the best games on the 3Ds, i remember when i first picked this game up in 2013 i continued playing consistently for almost 5 years and i still find myself checking in on my villagers!"
23,TheBlueBouquet,"May 14, 2021",10,"Even though Animal Crossing: New Leaf is not a perfect game, I think it has way more personality, more things to do, and more life compared to Animal Crossing: New Horizons and is the closest you can get to perfection. When I was playing the game for two to three months, I really got board of the game because there wasn't anything to keep me interested. As of now, there are less buildings, shops and other places you can visit, villager dialogue is far more repetitive, there are less special characters to interact with, and most of the ""new"" features added into the game are honestly nothing special. Sure, teraforming gives the more creative players more freedom when designing their town, but for the interactive players, myself included, are held back by these selling points of the game. Also, the updates in that game are re-adding things from New Leaf that were already in the game at-launch and were spread out monthly to pad out development time and adding things in the game so that they can give the developers more time to implement things at their own pace. Sure, in New Leaf, there was only one update, but it added substantial amounts of content. And in that game, the execution was so much better because of how they envisioned the game. And taking your mark as mayor sure helped to change the conventions of the franchise and gave players more freedom with what they can do. And in this game, there are far more special characters, lots of fun mini-games to play with yourself, or with friends, and much, much more. And since New Horizons was held back by a global pandemic, it was stopped from being the best it could be. And since New Leaf was developed when there was any compromises, they didn't have to worry about delaying content implementation. And New Leaf just is much more special to me, and I will continue playing it for many years to come."
24,Hedaki,"May 12, 2021",9,"Amazing! Amazing! And Amazing! The only thing is that the music in the OG GCN game is better, but in place, it puts you as mayor on a town."
25,Kefero,"May 7, 2021",9,"Animal Crossing: New Leaf kept me interested until the end. It's a very good and interesting game. If you want engaging material, then look no further. With Animal Crossing: New Leaf, you become a mayor of a town. I would recommend Animal Crossing: New Leaf to any fan of the genre."
26,CharlestonBit,"May 2, 2021",10,"This game.... Its quite powerful,
To Anyone who has never played it before you need to, the game itself is great but there's something else that is just really amazing. It has this memorable spark of nostalgia after a few months of playing and that never goes away. Which is why this game is a 10 out of 10!"
27,yeet2009,"Apr 11, 2021",10,"I love this game its really fun its a lot (in my opinion) the best one in the series, better than ""New Horizons"""
28,redpandaman,"Apr 6, 2021",10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
29,TG098,"Apr 6, 2021",10,"Really fun, one of, if not the best 3ds game. I have put 100's of hours in and it still has something new to offer every single day. Every villager has so much character, which I can not say about new horizons, in my opinion the best game in the series."

31,MrTheMan,"Feb 20, 2021",5,"I understand why so many people love this game, but to me, it feels like an app I have to check on every day for an hour and do nothing gameplay."
32,marcelkuvshee,"Dec 10, 2020",0,"A very soulful and memorable game, whose virtual world, every sound and every melody remains in the heart for life. Thanks for this miracle!"
33,obthegeek,"Nov 22, 2020",10,"the pinnacle of the series, and one of my all time favourite games. i've sunk so many hours into this game for a reason. i'll always love the memories i made with it."
34,Luccio,"Oct 20, 2020",8,"New Leaf brought animal crossing to a whole new generation with marvelous splendor and arguably perfected the gameplay loop. Incredible game anyone can enjoy, however derivative it is of its previous entries."
35,gamerz4life,"Oct 12, 2020",5,"What can be said about this game? On paper, the game sounds like it should be fun. You become a mayor of a town in which you move in, you get control of designing the inside of your house and eventually the outside, and you are in charge of beefing up the town and bringing in new residents. It seems almost like it should be a Sims or SimCity type game. But then you start playing.

First, you’re provided with a tent as you’re told you need to have a down payment of 10,000 bells for them to get you a one-room shack as though you just moved out west. Then once you finally get your house, Tom frickin’ Nook has the nerve to say you now owe 39,800 bells for the place and you can’t upgrade the house at all until you pay it off. Oh and don’t worry those expansions will be even more exorbitant fees. It would be okay if in like the Sims you had real ways of making money but oh wait, you don’t. You have to shake trees for fruit, go digging for fossils, pick up shells, some of the most mundane tasks imaginable and then the shop offers you a couple hundred bells if you’re lucky. And don’t forget that while you’re collecting things you have limited inventory! So after you pick up a couple items (your required tools count as pocket space) you have to run over to immediately sell or plant your items, hopefully it’s the right time of day and they’re open!

As for upgrading the town itself, your assistant tells you a few Public Works Projects you can set in motion, but oh wait those cost hundreds of thousands of bells, that you’re pretty much expected to come up with out of your own pocket. You can set up a fund for the community to pitch in but they either don’t even notice that this is going on or they’ll give you 2 bells. Wow am I on my way now!

The villagers are pretty annoying, many of them, especially the people at the stores that you have to interact with constantly, will say the same few lines over and over again, and you can’t speed through the lines of text! And sometimes you’re tasked with finding certain villagers but they’re not always at home, they’re busy wandering around the place at the same time you are so you’re most likely going to go through town several times before coming across them. Oh and then the real question. Why are you the only human in this town? And you’re not even given the option to be a different creature, you can just choose human boy/human girl.

Time in-game is real time, there is no speeding up. You want nighttime? Well you better be playing at night. You have a contest during the day? Too bad if you’re not home to play. Time and day randomize the store items for you to buy as well. So if you want that fishing pole or butterfly net you have to check the store each day, crossing your fingers that it’s in stock today. And then there’s hardly anything to ever buy in store. What is the point?! Not to mention the awful clothing choices, where if you’re playing as a boy you can still be offered skirts and dresses?, where you can tell the only real reason those are still being sold is to cover up their lack of choices in that department. And not only that but you can also use your wallpaper colors and patterns to change your clothing patterns, like what?!

At the beginning, you think this game is kinda fun until you get several hours in and realize that you’re expected to do the same thing day in and day out, it never changes. And you realize that you don’t have any real power in this town as mayor. The loan-shark Tom Nook has more power in this town than you. This game is just a major time-waster where you can do real world chores digitally. I don’t see the appeal of this series and I’d rather spend my time playing a game that has meaning, a story, and is FUN! (Or doing my chores in the real world, thank you very much.) This is more a game for little kids, people who don’t want anything out ****, or hardcore Nintendo fans."
36,TEMP0,"Sep 6, 2020",10,"Best Animal Crossing game of all time, or maybe even one the best games of all time. The 4th installment of the Animal Crossing franchise is an endless experience that can allow hundreds of hours of open-ended gameplay.

New Leaf is something I'd recommend for many people"
37,Botwisbestgame,"Sep 1, 2020",0,****/NOaSdO5H91M this game **** its just a mario party wanna be.
38,jikflet,"Jun 26, 2020",10,"Is July 2020.  While everyone is playing AC new Horizons, I had the crazy idea of buying New Leaf for my 3ds.   never played any Animal Crossing game before and I thought, why not. ? lets see whats all about.  I Still love my 3ds so one more game to play on it.   An oh, boy ..! I get it now !  Im obsessed trying to make my town the best I can.   this is a 10/10 game.  One day ill buy the switch version, but for now I think I have years of fun on my 3ds.  Great game for sure! it relaxes me.  is peaceful and calm.  is a pleasure to pay your loan and to get money for town development,.  Is someone by any chance is reading this and still on 2020, want to buy this game, let me tell you is absolutely worth it.  And maybe even more than New horizons, as this one is compete and all content is there.  no need to wait for more content updates.  The entire game with all items, bugs, fishes, etc is here and I love that as a retro gamer."
39,koyukon,"Jun 17, 2020",6,"It's a great relaxing game with few faults on its own. It could be better in a lot of ways however. Music, ambiance, exploration, better dialogue. They took a lot of the challenge out of the series with this game and I think it would have been better if people had to work harder for bells and rare items. Getting rare valuable bugs and fish on the island should was game breaking and removed the need for every other bell making method in the game. Animal behavior was too repetitive and should be more like the previous titles or better."
40,Nico49,"Jun 13, 2020",8,"I had a lot of fun with this game. The chracters have charm, the gameplay will never be boring, the grafic is nice and the soundtrack too."
41,Big_Ravioli,"May 23, 2020",9,"Thank you, loyal citizens of my town, for donating a combined total of 5 bells towards a new trash can while I spend hundreds of thousands of bells in order to complete it. Truly, if it weren't for your help, we'd never be able to throw away our garbage."
42,AskAtlas,"May 5, 2020",8,"About eight years ago, Nintendo released this beautiful masterpiece with very few flaws to criticize over.  There are native fruits and island fruits, which seems the island fruits have disappeared from the next title: New Horizons.  I have enjoyed the role of mayor and because I just got the game a month ago, I decided to time travel backwards to its release date to experience everything, event for event.

I have enjoyed minigames, decorating my town with every fruit (some I got from Harvest Day), and using features like Dream Suites.

This game however, is not perfect and some things did bother me, such as why an putdoor bench could not be placed outside after buying it from Nook Emporium?  However, this added charm to the house interior because no longer did I see a house as a house, but each room for its own story.  I was sad when I realized island minigames, island fruits, Gracie, Brewster did not make it to our island adventure practically foretold by tortimer island.  I saw there was also a campsite where I vould buy stuff, a flea market where I could put stuff for sale for any villager to consider...this was a charm in New Leaf that sadly never moved forward.  How does pocket camp, a mobile game, have more fruits than a Switch title (not that all fruit and vegetables came to New Leaf either)?

Nintendo should consider making New Horizons a superior title, combing all of what Animal Vrossing games have and could offer.  I am thankful for this experience, and I wish New Leaf wasn't superior to New Horizons in my experience, but until all of this could be incorporated there, I prefer my town compared to my island."
43,martimnog,"Apr 22, 2020",10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
44,flyingbeaver,"Apr 20, 2020",10,"This game is unbeatable. There’s so many things to do everyday. The shops are really cool and upgradable. The characters have really fun personalities. The holiday events are something to look out to every year. All the easter eggs in this game are unbelievable. I have played this game for 6 years straight and even the day before ACNH came out, i found new info about this game. A straight 10."
45,md5fungi,"Apr 1, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing: New Leaf may very well be the king of casual gaming.

Having arrived in your new town by train, the local residents mistake you for the mayor. Despite your pleas to the contrary, they are completely convinced, and you hilariously end up taking upon the role. The quirky, humorous charm of the game starts here and pervades every facet of the adorable world you’ll be a part of.

The goal of the game is simple but open-ended: expand your town and furnish your house. If the game has one shortcoming, it’s that the various activities you can take part in gradually unlock as you progress through the game. The first few days in particular give you very little to do besides catching bugs and fishing, but after that, there is a massive amount of content that awaits.

Massive is no understatement: yes, the main activities include fishing, catching bugs, planting and harvesting fruit, buying and selling items and furniture, and doing favors for residents, but there’s so much more here. You can inflate prices of items and convince residents to buy them on the flea market, shake beehives out of trees and carefully swipe the bees for a generous profit (this can be tricky at first to do without getting stung), acquire a golden shovel that allows you to literally plant money trees, open a coffee shop that you can work at, and even travel to a tropical island that has extremely valuable bugs, fish, and a slew of mini-games that provide you with medals to buy special items (not to mention exotic fruit you can swipe mid-game).

Making money (or “bells” in this series) is a central part of Animal Crossing: New Leaf. You’ll take out loans to expand your house, which you’ll pay back with large sums of bells. Public works projects (e.g. bridges, police station, coffee shop) cost bells, as well as items, tools, and furniture. The great thing about the game is that most activities are very viable for making bells. There are extremely valuable fish and bugs, as well as fossils that sell for very good prices. Shaking trees often results in items and bells falling out, not to mention the aforementioned valuable bees. Even hitting rocks with your shovel will occasionally result in valuable ore or again, a ton of bells. There’s even a sort of stock market with turnips in the game that can yield incredible profits.

Even more impressive is the fact that the game world is constantly changing without you even doing anything. The game plays out in real time, so if you are playing at night, it’s night in the game, which means you can do certain things like attend nightclub shows that you couldn’t do during the day. As the seasons change in real life, the seasons change in Animal Crossing, which affects the availability of bugs and fish, the look of the town, and what events take place.

Special events keep the game exciting. On April Fool’s day, a character will show up in your town and impersonate villagers, and you are tasked with figuring out who the impostor is. Every so often, fishing tournaments are held. A fun spin on trick-or-treating takes place every Halloween.

Overall, New Leaf is pretty close to being the ultimate casual video game. There’s an astounding amount of content here, and one could easily spend hundreds of hours exploring all of it."
46,ShoujoWitch,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Figured I'd put a review up for New Leaf as I had signed up for metacritic to review the new game (New Horizons). New Leaf is aguably the definitive animal crossing. There's a few things missing from previous games, but nothing major. And the additions make it well worth the purchase. The game is absolutely jam packed with content, and improves upon the previous games in every way. They also went and made a huge downloadable update that gives tons of new content in the game, including fully playable minigames; with the return of a new entry in the puzzle league series which is amazing  @.@. Only nit-pick: the public works projects are really slow and kinda annoying to get going as you have to hope you randomly get one from the npcs, and then it's fairly expensive to get it set up. I never ended up getting certain major buildings in the game.

All in all, New Leaf is the animal crossing game I'd point people to when they ask which version they should play. And is one of the few games I've spent hundreds of hours in."
47,Mrisser,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"This is exactly the sort of game that I would love. I spent months being excited for the release of this game. I had never played animal crossing before and was excited to experience everything the game offered. Unfortunately, the game is poorly designed and there is only one island PER SWITCH. So while I was working, my girlfriend got the mesume and the shops on her profile. But because we share the same island, when I went to play all of those tasks had already been completed. I don't get to play significant portions of the game, it is as simple as that. The game progresses when I am not playing. It is an awful system that makes my girlfriend feel bad for playing and me feel bad for not playing. The gameplay is good, but I have lost all interest from the fact that so much was done without me. I don't know how this game company thought for a second this was an okay thing to do. This is good game that is unnecessarily ruined by an awful decision. I do not recommend this game."
48,Hizubiki25,"Mar 28, 2020",9,This game is very innovative and fresh due to the role of the mayor and new features and content they added. Must play.
49,MarcSeriesX,"Mar 25, 2020",7,"I love the game, but I think the graphic quality is improvable and more things could have been added to the video game. But if you want it for a small console, honestly it's fine!"
