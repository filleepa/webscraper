NotKs,"Jun 7, 2025",4,"fun at first, but eventually it just gets boring after you unlock a lot of stuff. also the villagers just have like 1 message of dialog that keeps repeating when you talk to them"
Colt123mario7,"Jun 6, 2025",10,"Que jogo maravilhoso! É muito relaxante, a trilha sonora é incrível, é divertido, você pode jogar por anos e ainda tem coisa para fazer. É muito legal a relação que você faz com os personagens e como você pode ajeitar a ilha do seu jeito."
FlashbackMT12,"Jun 6, 2025",7,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons was a fantastic escape during the COVID-19 pandemic that everybody needed. The definition of perfect timing. That being said, the game is held back by a severe lack of content updates, and very few reasons for me to go back to my island."
Gigglez,"May 13, 2025",10,"I come back to it every now and again and it still makes me happy. So much variety and customisation. A wonderful style that has me wanting so many things in game has in real life. There are some issues, repetitive characters, no mini games like previous ones apparently had and they stopped updating it way too early but given that I have 1000+ hours in it clearly I felt it was enough."
pat_bat_matt,"Apr 30, 2025",10,"An absolutely amazing game, it’s got something for everyone, no matter your age. The rich content, charming visuals, and outstanding crafting system are a total blast to play."
starrrrxmsmp,"Apr 27, 2025",4,"Exciting at first but heavily disappointig in retrospect. Much less content than new leaf. More of a builder simulator than a life sim like previous AC games. Many beloved characters gone, game feels flat, less stores, less upgrades, redundant dialogue, no mini games, online is useless and insanely time consuming to setup. If you use the game for what it’s good at (decorating) your switch will run the game at 15 fps."
Rat_du_49,"Apr 8, 2025",1,"J'ai joué plus de 250 heures à ce jeu et je regrette fortement d'y avoir perdu mon temps.
Si je devais résumer ce jeu en un mot, ce serait emmm*rdant, ou ennuyant à mourir, ou même nul à chi*r."
Timster2,"Apr 7, 2025",9,"This is an amazing game! The story is great, because you can design your own island! This is different from any other Animal Crossing game. Sure, you could do public works projects to put stuff outside. But this game allows you to put anything thing outside, and you're not limited to a few things. The sky's the limit. The villagers are so nice, but their text is pretty bland. For example, when one of your villager's are sitting down, when you talk to them they say, ""Sometimes I  just like to sit."" See what I mean! The gameplay can be a bit slow because it takes a day to build almost anything. But I understand, the game developers don't want you to build Rome in a day. What I mean by that is that they don't want you to get everything in a week because then you'll get bored. I wish that there was more house upgrades because New Leaf had a bit more, and New Horizons should have at least the same amount. This is still an amazing game! I would give it a 93/100, there are some minor problems, but they're so small that it doesn't matter."
Pinkphi,"Apr 5, 2025",10,"I spent many many hours playing it, the new update was great! We need more updates as once you purchase everything there is nothing new to explore. But is a great game! Highly recommend if you like relaxing games, decorating, fishing, collect bugs, design your island etc"
HaloBlues,"Apr 2, 2025",5,"The graphics are charming and genuinely pretty in places such as the sky/weather and the textures and designs of most of the villagers. It's easy to forget how good they are, but looking back at older games makes it clear that New Horizons is a massive graphical upgrade. Characters are appropriately adorable-looking, but completely devoid of personality. Villagers are the entire point of this franchise, as well as the bonds you form with yours, and yet in this game they've been reduced to window-dressing for your customised island who recite the same dozen generic lines identical to every other villager of the same type. A lot of my 'dream villagers' are of the same few types, and so I can be hitting nothing but repeated dialogues within literal minutes of opening the game. It's soulless. The gameplay is... fine. There are some good QoL improvements, such as the way clothes shopping now works at the Able Sisters and terraforming the land, but there are just... so many things that were a given in older games that have been cut out or have regressed in this one. The crafting system is awful and repetitive, DIY recipes are time-consuming to get and even then mostly just carbon copies of ones you already have, even golden tools (extremely difficult to construct) are now breakable, and shops have far fewer or no upgrades to uncover, just to name a few. You can have up to eight players on an island over online multiplayer, or up to four using local co-op. It's pretty much what you'd expect from Animal Crossing - you can run around together and visit each other's villagers (so you can experience their generic dialogue, too!) but aside from activities you can come up with and design yourself there's nothing to really do together. Overall, this game just... depresses me in a lot of ways. It's stripped back, sanitised, minimalised and ""streamlined"" in that corporate, modern game kind of way, where all the charm and heart is being lost in order to fit flashy new features to distract from all the ones that have been made worse. Sure, it was a nice refuge over lockdown, but it genuinely kind of angers me that that means this game is going down as a huge best-seller success when it's just... empty. It has the same kind of issue as Sims 4, to my mind, and the fact that so many players picked New Horizons up as their first Animal Crossing game means they don't even know what they're missing. I'll be returning to Wild World and perhaps even New Leaf, because playing this just reminds me I miss the old villagers."
charmander1,"Mar 29, 2025",8,"It would've been better if the villagers weren't so bland in comparison to early entries. They all say the same thing, no matter their personality type."
Z4ry,"Mar 24, 2025",6,"80+ hours
- Starts as expected (which is good)
- Decent evolution from previous title 
- Good graphics and performance
- tool to form the island comes too late for me"
Kemet_,"Mar 21, 2025",3,"Offering this kind of game, where you basically do nothing, a semi-simulation of managing your island, well... I might have enjoyed it if I didn’t know about all the other great games out there."
da333,"Mar 9, 2025",0,"최악의 게임.
코로나 시기 잘 타서 많이 판매했지만
게임 자체의 완성도가 없음
전 작품이 너무 히트쳐서 그 발판으로 많이 팔았고 인기도 얻었지만 전 작품의 완성도+코로나 시기로 운이 대박 터져 판매량은 높지만 게임 자체로는 최악"
kknchh,"Feb 14, 2025",10,"In my opinion, is the best Animal Crossing game. I bought Nintendo Switch just for Animal Crossing New Horizons, AND I DON'T REGRET IT. Cute animals, good dialogs."
lq820,"Feb 10, 2025",8,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a charming life - sim worthy of an 8. Its colorful visuals, creative DIY system, real - time seasons, and engaging social elements with villagers and other players are big pluses. The island is a great place for creativity. But it has downsides like repetitive tasks and an unintuitive UI. Still, it offers a relaxing and enjoyable experience."
DonkeyKongo,"Jan 27, 2025",5,It WAS a great game. The game just doesnt get Updates anymore. The last big Update was the 2.0 Update in 2021. The game just gets boring after some time.
jxstjxlius,"Jan 27, 2025",6,"Man hat seine 30h Tasks, bis man nichts mehr zu tun hat. Und diese Tasks sind auch nur wiederholend, bis es langweilig wird."
Critisiser1234,"Jan 16, 2025",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is, without a doubt, one of the most captivating games in the series. It builds upon the beloved formula of the previous titles while introducing new mechanics, beautiful graphics, and endless customization options. While it’s easily one of the best entries in the franchise, I believe it falls short of being the best—ranking just behind Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Here’s why.First, let’s talk about the graphics, which are absolutely stunning. The vibrant, pastel-like colours and meticulously designed environments make your island feel alive and full of possibility. The changing seasons, day-night cycles, and even the weather create an immersive world. From the gentle sway of trees to the calm ripple of water as you fish, the visuals are breathtaking. The animals themselves are also more expressive than ever, with unique animations that make them feel more like living characters.However, the game’s dialogue and villager interactions, while charming, lack some of the depth seen in earlier games. The villagers now deliver sweet, often funny speeches, but there's less of the emotional weight that made GameCube or New Leaf so special. For example, when a villager moves away, the farewell isn’t as moving as in previous games, and many villagers repeat generic phrases rather than showing the depth of personality we came to love.While the core gameplay—fishing, bug catching, decorating, and designing—remains enjoyable, some key elements were removed. The lack of Animal Tracks (villager footprints left around the island) feels like a missed opportunity to add more life to the world. Additionally, the special holidays from earlier titles are fewer, and the events themselves feel more streamlined and less rewarding. While we have Toy Day, Bunny Day, and others, there’s less variation in how they’re celebrated compared to New Leaf, which offered a wider range of **** of the biggest frustrations is the island limitations. While the concept of designing your island is fantastic, there’s a lack of variety in island layouts, and you can’t interact with villagers in the same ways you could in past games. The Nook Miles system also limits what you can do early on, requiring a lot of grinding just to unlock more content.Finally, paying for an online membership to visit friends' islands is disappointing. The joy of sharing your creations and seeing others should be free, especially given how central the multiplayer aspect is to the game.Overall, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautiful, fun game but has its shortcomings in villager interactions, missing content, and the online experience. Still, it’s the second-best Animal Crossing game for its gorgeous visuals and the freedom it offers.Final verdict: 9/10. A stunning and enjoyable experience, but not without its flaws."
notagoose025,"Jan 11, 2025",5,its a beautiful fun game with a nice story great casual play and almost a impossibly perfect formula for seemingly infinite content if it was 2020 i would say its a must have for any switch owner but since like 2022 the game feels unsupported and baren the only kind of people playing it are avid fans and treasure island streams and i would really suggest just waiting until Nintendo ether gives new support to the game or makes a new animal crossing
ReallyPegLeg,"Jan 10, 2025",7,This is a really fun franchise and game. You can feel the amount of creativity that went into every single one of the games. But I unfortunately don't find these games all too appealing. I spent maybe a month or two on this game before forgetting I even owned it.
Starry99,"Jan 5, 2025",10,Amazing Game Would Recommend To All My Friends. It Is A Chill Signal Player Game
DanielFortal81,"Dec 29, 2024",10,Jogo incrível! Nintendo teve tanto carinho com esse  jogo que nos faz esquecerd9.mundo real enquanto estamos na ilha.
CallieShiver20,"Dec 25, 2024",0,"Bland turbo-trash that killed its updates way too early. Avoid this turbo-steaming, fiery pile of trash like a disease."
mistercookie447,"Dec 6, 2024",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s such a chill and relaxing experience that you can sink hours into without even realizing it. The freedom you get to design your island, customize your house, and create your own little paradise is unmatched. Whether you’re planting flowers, building bridges, or just hanging out with the adorable villagers, it’s the kind of game that makes you feel at peace. The seasonal events and special updates keep it fresh and exciting, making you want to come back and see what’s **** music and sound effects are so soothing and really add to the vibe of the game. And don’t even get me started on the villagers—they have so much personality and make the game feel alive. You get attached to them, and when they leave, it’s like saying goodbye to a friend. And then there’s Tom Nook, the capitalistic king of the island who somehow manages to make you feel like you’re the one in charge while he’s pulling all the strings behind the scenes. The man’s a genius when it comes to selling you overpriced homes and upgrades, but you can’t help but love him for it. It’s hilarious how he’s both a business mogul and your best buddy at the same time.I used to play it all the time, but sadly, I sold my Switch because I wasn’t using it much. Now, I really regret it. I miss spending time in my little island paradise, creating new designs, and seeing what my favorite villagers are up to. It’s such a great game that I’d love to pick up again. It’s just pure comfort and joy, and the kind of game that makes you smile every time you play."
coolboy12345,"Dec 1, 2024",7,Very fun game and really relaxing. Don't really like how it follows real world time but  still very fun and relaxing
Ekz0,"Nov 20, 2024",10,"Haven't even played it and can already tell it is one of the better Nintendo games out there. Trumps Mario Odyssey by miles, never play odyssey, play animal crossing"

andyfullyo12,"Sep 14, 2024",7,"I like the game, but there are some people saying there are 1 island per switch"
Lord_Poshman,"Sep 13, 2024",8,"What a time sink ****, for good and for bad. The game has a lot of things to do around your island at first but it does tend to get a bit repetitive after a 200 hours or so but even then, you could continue perfecting your island or spending more time with the DLC Home designer which could be a great experience. Overall it is the game we all needed at the time but now the lack of substantial content drops have limited its replay value"
Bradyherbst7,"Sep 13, 2024",9,"Phenomenal!!!
I don't even like cozy farm games anymore, but this game is soooo goood!
It's cute and pollished. It has a sense of addictiveness that me and many other people enjoy. The community while filled with complaining attitudes is one of the most special elements of this game.
I will say that I understand the critisism that this game was a letdown. We were promised 2-3 years of updates, and all we got was around 1 and a half. I will say that the people saying that have put thousands of hours into the game already so it's a bit of a moot point.

This game has many plus's tho-
It's seriously unbeleivaby cute, everything from the animals, to the objects, character creators are so adorable. The gameplay is fun especially when you don't time travel. You get a sense of accomplishment which is funny because all you did was sit at home playing Animal Crossing (This part was fun especially in the 2020 lockdown) This game while clearly not being even remotly realistic is a great social sim. The villagers are charming and fun to talk to, you can build them objects and fufill requests, give them gifts etc. The game is forever playable and never ending. So you can get as much animal crossing content as you want until you eventually get sick of i, and the animals will be waiting for you to come back when you do.

It's great, I've sunk far too many hours into it, but I love it"
Declue,"Aug 9, 2024",8,The idea of not letting you proceed with the game after your daily job is done so that you will have to come back tomorrow is so brilliant yet so simple.
Thwompthing,"Aug 19, 2024",3,Boring crap.  who cares about a farm sim?  Glad I don't play this garbage.  Yuck.

jorge1102,"Aug 16, 2024",5,玩法個人不喜歡，買實體片，賣掉回血。無法讓我持續投入遊玩，並且無法感到好玩有趣。這遊戲可能更適合別的玩家，不適合我。建議沒玩過這系列的買實體片，不好玩還可以賣掉回血
MortalBeats,"Aug 6, 2024",10,"This is my favorite game, it is very meditative and relaxing. It is always a pleasure to return to the world of animal crossing. This game is capable of dragging on for a long time, and surprises with new events every time. If you have a Nintendo switch, then you just have to play this masterpiece."
WikiPlane48,"Jul 30, 2024",8,Possibly the best animal crossing game to come.                                                               .
LEGames,"Jul 8, 2024",9,Amazing game great graphics I just love it SO MUCH it’s perfect but I think they could improve on some stuff
RestlessWater,"Jul 3, 2024",1,"I thought this game was okay. Some things in the game are cool but it is a game that loves to waste the players time with everything that you do, and because of that, I hate it so much.

The Good
The graphics are very good and cute.
You can move most of the objects that you place.
You can customize your house and island.

The Bad
There’s no story. You just have to talk to right people to make your island better. And, even when I was putting a lot of cool expensive things around the island, Isabelle still gave it a 1 star, saying that I needed to improve it.

The game is so damn grindy. Omg. The amount of time that it takes to accumulate enough money to pay off each debt keeps increasing to a stupid degree. How can adding another room be more expensive than the last extra room?

Dialogue takes forever to complete, even when you are pressing it to make it go faster. It still takes too long!You can’t buy a ton of a single item at once. 

You can only buy an item one at a time. It’s crazy! I expected more from Nintendo. You can however buy seeds in bulk of 5 at the shop.

Everything wastes your time. Talking to the museum owl, he says the same thing every time and it’s annoying. All his complaining and bulls##t too.

Crafting items ****. When crafting you have to manually put the specific ingredients in your bag to craft an item. Items cannot be used from your storage. 

Tools that you make break fast. It’s beyond stupid how that works for your high-end tools.

All the characters seem to talk the same. Some may have their own little quirks like Cherry saying “what what” at the end of sentences.

Birds who appear on the beach all make you do the same fetch every time! Same with the ghost!

The scallop guy in the ocean is annoying when he pops up and wants to spread his useless thoughts.

You have to hold the “B” button then move the analog all the way to make your character run. Just make the damn character run! What else is that button used for?

Going to another island when using a ticket makes the switch run hotter and you can hear it and feel it. Like, how can a small island with one villager stress the switch?

There’s no way to know what items you already own. I had no idea what clothes or stuff I bought from the nook store. So I stopped caring and just wore one thing. No point in collecting a ton of clothes or items that I’ll never know that I have dupes of, especially when it doesn’t matter and even more so when there is only so much space in the storage. Hanging clothes on the walls is dumb.

There’s no way to change controls, keybindings, or settings. I wanted to play with the dpad. Scared of drift.

People want and can leave the island. Problem is, you need resources that you can only get once per day, and then you have to use that to buy a ticket to then fly to get people. Why make it a pain in the a#$ to have some attempt to beat this game?

Everything in this game is so expensive.

An achievement wants you to play every day for a year.

Some items take too long or are too hard to get.

Conclusion
I gave the game 85 hours of my life, when I knew that playing my other games, like mario wonder or kingdom hearts, was way more fun. Bottomline, the game doesn’t respect your time."
100sam,"Jun 22, 2024",5,Animal crossing it's alright one of my most played games on my switch. Thing is it's so stresssfulwith the decorating getting materials and stuff. I recently came back to it and resetted my island and a fresh start by flattening it but it'shust to much. You have to place furniture everywhere outside like i wish it was basic and just flowers and path and trees only outside like new leaf and no terraforming makes it complicated
LuciferCaeleste,"Jun 18, 2024",9,"This is my first Animal Crossing game. I bought it back in late November 2020 to help with my PTSD. I'm still playing it as of this post. Doing island chores each day (30 minutes to an hour) might be boring to some people but it helps me relax, and I'm grateful for that."
KajQrd,"Jun 15, 2024",4,"It's a time sink, but sadly for all the wrong reasons. I have 75 hours so far in the game. But a LOT of it is basically fast clicking to repeat mundane tasks like buying bell vouchers, crafting multiples of the same thing etc. Instead of doing the logical thing and having an option to purchase or craft multiples by a simple box asking how many it's five different clicks per item purchased, several clicks per item crafted etc. How is this in any way acceptable? Luckily I am the only person using my switch. But the limit to one island per console is also a MAJOR point of pure idiocy. And no cloud save means if the console goes so does your island (yes, this has happened to me). It does have some things going for it. The graphics are cute, the social aspect is fine (though I do think **** Valley does it better) but it is hard to respect a game that clearly doesn't respect your time."
psycholosan,"Jun 5, 2024",9,"It's a little unfair , I gave that Game a 9. It would've gotten a 10 , if I was someone who loves to craf and design for hours. But I'm not xd. Nevertheless, for me it's a ""I should check out my Island a little"" then play it for 1-2 Hours make some changes and go off. Even though im not the guy for Sandbox, this game calls me everyday to play it a little"
OmoriBoy,"May 21, 2024",10,"Bought this for my girlfriend. Without a doubt, the best decision of my life."
xgeorgiiax16,"May 12, 2024",1,"I have been playing since 2006. 

The characters have been massively dumbed down, they have no personality. 
WAY too many weeds.
Terraforming is not fun, please make it stop.
Everything takes so much time, it’s overwhelming. I don’t want to craft all day. 
Where has all the fruit gone? 
There is nothing new that is fun.
The islands you can travel to collect things ****. 
The easter event is awful.
The shop upgrade is so basic.

I am so disappointed, instead of enhancing the experience you have ruined it.
This was my comfort game, now it is just a stressful, unpleasant experience."
Ciccillo77,"May 12, 2024",5,"The game have much potential but it don t use all beacues have so much bug and after finish the game you can t make much,but only for the dlc the game are safe 6/10"
Dan_Zimmer,"May 6, 2024",8,Animal Crossing New Horizons is a ball of a time but you have to understand that when you play it you will hit a wall. eventually you do whatever you wanted to do and you need to take  abreak before finding the next thing.Other than that the game isso smooth and well done giving an excellent simulator game for a guy that doesnt even really like simulator games.
Lumiaxelite,"May 5, 2024",8,"Being a big fan of Animal Crossing, it's impossible not to play it!On the other hand, we very quickly reach the limits of the switch, the devs understood this well and quickly stopped the updates, which is a shame."
IlGufo21,"May 1, 2024",7,"Personally a big waste of money, in terms of quality there is no doubt, the game takes you a lot even if you don't like it, because it tries to prolong everything you have to do. Of course, if you don't like the genre, you'll never like it"
Thatonegamer1,"Apr 30, 2024",10,Animal Crossing New Horizons is basically perfect. This games music atmosphere and characters are all amazing. This game is very calming and the community is amazing (Just don't mention Raymond)
Amistiel,"Apr 29, 2024",10,"I love this game, it's bright and friendly community helped me stay sane during covid-times. It was such a perfect timing with this game, lucky :)) but also the game itself is super adorable and relaxing!"
Boysle,"Apr 24, 2024",5,"Disappointing.
First of all, I am a fan of the series. New Leaf was one of my favorite 3DS games. I enjoyed New Horizons for some time so my score is not lower than 5.
What made me keep playing New Horizons was the possibility of building my ultimate dream world. At first, it started great, hour by hour, slowly improving my island. After a hundred hours, though, I started to lose interest, and looking back, all I saw were unfinished dreams and bitter feelings of regret for losing all these hours.
So, what happened? To start and invest time in these games, you have to build trust in the game itself about what the end game will bring. However, the game came out unfinished so the trust shifted from the game itself to the developers. Ultimately, the developers failed to deliver quality updates and it made everything fall to the ground.
My last complaint is about the villager's personalities. They are always so agreeable and getting the same line from two different villagers with the same personality breaks the immersion."
Tipt03,"Apr 21, 2024",4,"Gotta be honest, I find this game really boring. The only improvements are the amount of customization options and different skintones (because animal crossing was way behind in that aspect). Other than that, this is a step down from New Leaf. The terraforming, which was the most advertised feature, takes forever to get to. New Leaf lets you jump into the fun immediately, but here you have to wait soo long until the interesting part. I actually didn't get to the terraforming because I put the game down a year ago and haven't checked on it since. I've never lost interest in a game so quickly. Another thing that bothers me is how washed down and boring the villagers (or islanders) are now. I know there were people who didn't like how some villagers were mean or sassy in older games, but you can't deny that it added spice and made them feel like real neighbors (because not everybody will instantly love you upon first meeting in real life, obviously). But now all the villagers have the same cookie-cutter niceness, making them lose what made them distict. Even villagers with snooty and grouchy personality types lack the edge they used to have. New Horizons was only critically acclaimed because it released during the pandemic when everyone was dying of boredom. If it was released before or a year after the pandemic, I'd imagine people would've been much more critical of it. I think they tried too hard to be ""cozy"" and ""chill"" that it backfired and made the game boring and bland."
froomie01,"Apr 6, 2024",7,Animal crossing new horizons is a great looking game but lacks the charm and content the series is know for and feels to short. There is only a few goals in the game to keep the player intrigued and if the player fails to find a connection with the game they will probably stop playing as they feel unfufilled.
Melwheezy,"Apr 5, 2024",10,"This game single handley helped me through the first year of the pandemic , and made cozy games a whole new genre chefs kiss."
Ugnaughtlover69,"Apr 4, 2024",2,Yeah yeah yeah farming and **** we get it. I like slave labour and abusing animals as much as the next guy but the lack of Ugnaughts in this horrid game is disturbing!
jarcub,"Mar 30, 2024",10,"Animal Crossing New Horizons ist ein wunderbares Spiel.
Der Release hat viel dazu beigetragen, dass das Spiel sich ca. 40 Millionen Mal verkauft hat, da es am Anfang der Corona-Pandemie veröffentlicht wurde. Und ein Simulationsspiel zu einer solchen Zeit ist **** sieht wunderschön für Switchverhältnisse aus und kann ohne Probleme mit Spielen wie Luigi's Mansion 3, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe oder The Legendof Zelda Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom **** Spiel bietet viel Content, viel wurde aber erst durch kostenfreie Updates **** Gegensatz zu vielen älteren Animal Crossing Ablegern beeinhaltet das Spiel wohl weniger Feiertage und besondere Events, das New Horizons jedoch mein erstes Animal Crossing Spiel ist, kann ich nichts dazu sagen und ignorie den Punkt in meiner **** kann das Spiel mit bis zu 7 Mitspielern spielen, lokal sowie **** Online-Modus gibt es das Probleme mit den Fehlern beim Verbinden. Man kann das Spiel jedoch auch Offline genießen und braucht sich deshalb keine Gedanken **** DLC hat die Ferienhausagentur und somit einen Grund hinzugefügt, weshalb es sich lohnt weitere 50-100 Stunden in dem Spiel zu verbringen. 25 Euro lohnen sich in diesem Fall zu zahlen."
J0626,"Mar 24, 2024",2,"Animal Crossing New Horizons success was complete luck in that the COVID 19 pandemic meant people needed something to do, and which game was just coming out? Animal Crossing New Horizons. However, previous Animal Crossing players such as myself noticed that something was missing in this game. A lot of things were missing. And even after the year and a half of updates that should have been there from the start, there were still things missing. While Harvey’s Island added pop up shops, it was a lazy excuse for past games permanent shops and even shopping districts. The game also took away several NPCs that were staples in the franchise, as well as also removing the negative aspects of Villager dialogue almost completely. The only time villagers get mad at you anymore is if you hit them with a net or push them around. The game also puts an immense focus on decorating and customization so much that you’re basically god. You can put anything wherever you want, villagers no longer move out on their own but instead need your permission, and with the DLC you can also customize their houses at your will. All of the charm was taken out replaced by you making every signal decision and you now being your islands new monarchy."
Letamaru,"Mar 21, 2024",4,"Animal Crossing New Horizons occupies a weird spot in my games folder. 
It flourishes with great ideas and additions like terra forming, the crafting of tools and furnitures, and basically unlimited control over your island. 
During the Covid pandemic, the game really appeared as a life saver, allowing us to get together in our little islands. 

However, since then, we got barely any new content aside from a god-awful Easter event and a mild separate island for bonus characters like Redd the kitsune or Saharah the camel.
Ultimately, this meant having basically less content than what the 3DS game offered, but in a pricier package. No shop upgrades after the first one, no coffee shop separate from the museum, golden tools that are breakable despite their awful price, no Kappn Island, and a paid DLC that barely improved anything at all despite known issues for months. 

This leaves ACNH as an unfinished, unpolished state that feels more like an open beta than a fully finished game. As such, while I cannot call it a ""bad"" game per se, I cannot in my right mind recommend it."
Nauer,"Mar 15, 2024",8,"I really enjoyed my time on this game, especially during COVID. The game is great and the content was good and it was my first experience with this sage. 

But since, there is a lack of content, things are always the same and it has been boring. We got 1 major update and the game was abandonned."
domin0h,"Mar 2, 2024",7,"It was fun playing it, even though after some time it feels dull. After a certain point, the things you can do in one day are fishing, plugging weed on your island and go to another island to do the same.
After you have done your ""daily duties"", you can go on and do them again or drop the game like i did. Some parts just feel to long, building a house for another islander - takes atleast a day. Expand your home - takes atleast a day. and so on.. 
Especially the part where you have to get a better rating for your island to progress takes longer and the definition is too ""sloppy"" and takes forever to progress past that. Not even the cuteness factor of the islanders can sustain my interest in progressing further."
TrueOptimist,"Mar 1, 2024",6,"I really enjoyed my time with other games in this series, specifically the DS and 3DS version. Unfortunately, this one really didn't do anything new for me. While its never looked better and you might have 1 or 2 new tools, its just is that same game over a decade later. Even the multiplayer stuff is implemented so poorly and just getting to a friends island is a hassle. That's no surprise since Nintendo still relies on friend codes in this day and age. The loop of getting money in these games is still not changed after all this time either, which could use a serious improvement. Even just the stuff you put on your island is not interesting enough, make more interactable items to use or play mini games on, something!"
TobiasKing12,"Feb 26, 2024",5,Critics love Nintendo but the reality is that they overrated this game by a lot. It's very boring and doesn't have anything special about it.
maddyjayde,"Feb 16, 2024",10,It got us all through 2020 lockdowns ok it's a clear 10 out of 10. I'm still playing it in 2024 somehow too which is honestly just wild.
DemonKnight04,"Feb 13, 2024",8,"Needs a rework of multiplayer and minigames. Very customizable and a large amount of villages to get. The game is a bit grindy and a lot of things take many weeks to do, not possible to unlock everything in one day. It makes you want to come back everyday and do more. 8/10"
TheRickSanchez,"Jan 16, 2024",10,"By far the deepest entry in this series of animal crossing games, New horizons is a cozy crafting king."
lostleader,"Jan 13, 2024",8,"New Horizons is kinda a step back from New Leaf in a few ways that I don't like, but ultimately it's better for it. The slow build to making your island into a villager/town is actually kinda inspiring, and being able to control far more than you ever could in New Leaf will certainly make it hard to go to back to. The new characters are all pretty much hits, and while I do miss some of the older characters, the promise of new updates and proper fixes may mean any complains will be moot as well. Still breakable tools, not being able to bulk craft, and season events being tied to the internet still **** at launch"
alexaxa,"Jan 12, 2024",1,"I'm glad we rented this as it's impossible for a family to enjoy the game and build his own island. For some obscure reason, the game can only handles a single island per Nintendo Switch so only one of the profile on the console can actually unlocks stuff on the island."
Insularis,"Jan 8, 2024",5,"Just another animal crossing game, but this time you need to pay a subscription to play with your friends, while the game itself is not even the best Animal Crossing. It's okay for the most part, but not much more than that"
Elly1962,"Jan 1, 2024",0,"If I could give this game -9999 I would do it in a hear beat. It feels like some employee at nintendo, wanted to watch the world burn. This game is a literal waste of time.Nintendo Sales Rep (hypothetical): In this new rendition of animal crossing, EVERYTHING is movable.That is a COMPLETE lie. It's true that everything is movable, but not the damn residence centertownhall. Literally wasted my time playing my way through to the point of landscaping, only to discover; majority of the buildings are movable.... ACNH is a paper weight now.Nintendo has gone donw the gutter IMO... This idea of a paywall to access my own internet. That is a new low. Nintendo, welcome to my blacklist."
OopiDoopi,"Dec 27, 2023",9,"Fun and perfect, but also incredibly nerve wracking. One of the few games that don't give me a headache from too much visual noise. It's a good virtual retreat from reality."
ExplosiveBolts,"Dec 21, 2023",0,You have to dump trash all over your island to increase your island score. Whoever designed this system is a moron.
Big_Boi_Philip,"Dec 8, 2023",10,"Animal Crossing has been one of nintendos franchises that always stood out to me as a core nintendo fan enjoying each part the franchise has to offer. As the super Animal Crossing fan I am, I feel that we can safely dub this the greatest Animal Crossing game to date. 

The game completely opens the customization options for the player being the first game to do many new quality of life improvements and the first to completely fill the game with new features. However, while the new levels of customization are fantastic it comes at the cost of the villagers being bland/general lack of interaction with NPC's. ACNH focused on giving the player the best experience in terms of its core concept, building a community from scratch on a desert island, however sometimes the community feeling dissapears with the lack of backbone and sometimes raw personality from villagers. 

ACNH also has fewer buildings and special characters in general compared to its predecessor New Leaf mostly due to the setting but this doesn't excuse the fact that this does make your home island much more empty. And while ACNH feels the same if not slightly worse in a lot of those aspects compared to ACNL it does however exceed its predecessor in almost all other categories. 

The visuals of the game are stunning with each sprite feeling detailed and completely finished with no parts of the games visuals giving off the sense of ""cut corners"" to save development time.

New features in this games make their exclusion in past game stick out showing nintendo's great vision for the franchise. Crafting and placing furniture outside is a must have creating endless possibilities for the ever creative fanbase. As previously stated many quality of life improvements are amazing with decorating your own house now being a breeze.

As for the DLC expansion it does not disappoint. It provides a completely new setting and main goal only paywalling small features not forcing players into buying it. 

All in all, I place this game as the best of the best in nintendos history books."
eeeres,"Nov 15, 2023",8,Really fun to design your island and live your life peacefully. This game will help calm you down after a long day at school or work. Collecting all the creatures to fill out the critterpedia is so fun and a long task. Only gripe is that the villager interactions are stale so there's not much use talking to them unlike in previous games.
Yill,"Nov 5, 2023",9,"This Animal Crossing game is highly customizeable in its world building. You have to be aware when buying this, that you need to make your own goals in the game and I'd generally say you'd need to be into the concept of creating your own little wholesome world in order to enjoy this game in the first place. 
In terms of actual entertainment provided from the game itself, there are special events like holidays etc. where there are certain tasks you can fulfill. Other than that you're basically on your own with what you want to do, which can be both positive or negative.
This game is super saturated, cute and cozy. I'd genuinely give it a 10/10 rating, and believe it could be one of the best games in its genre, but unfortunately I have to subtract a point for the lack of minigames that were a very BIG part of the multiplayer fun in ACNL. It's definitely something that's missing. Still, I have around 600hours in this game and only connect positive times with it. (*´˘`*)♡"
Winzidy,"Nov 3, 2023",7,really good just not my thing
sunb3me,"Nov 2, 2023",9,"This game is amazing, there is nothing wrong with it except for the some what  soulless NPCs, I only say this because the last games had very geniune NPCswho were actually interesting to talk to. This is really the only problem with the game. Many people will say its for people who dont play videogames or dont have time, blablabla. I have played videogames all my life, I love games in which u can grind for hours and never get bored, the thing is my dopamine recievers are melted down like these other losers who say its bad do to the progression. Its a great game, its so fun to play alone, the enviromnet of it is amazing, the music is great (not as good as the older games though) and its just as what its presented as. If you arent fond of games with slow progression than dont buy it, if you actually have a the brain of a average human and dont spend 10 hours on tiktok everyday thenyou will have a lot of fun."
ket,"Nov 2, 2023",8,"I didn't know what to expect from AC one of my female friends just pestered me until I gave in and bought it. I tured out to be surprised by it though AC is a good game to play when you just want to sit back and chill. The gameplay is perhaps too simple though with perhaps the best description for it being all the potential of the world but the ability of a chimp. You can buy things like tractors and boats but you can't drive them yourself and just about everything you'll do you'll think the developers could have added 2 or 3 more layers of depth to keep things more interesting and engaging. Speaking to my female friend she informed me of many things previous AC installments had and how they are not in AC for Switch, I have to admit I feel disappointed by not having what I've been told about in AC for Switch and if I had played earlier AC games I'd be downright annoyed about it and probably rating AC for Switch a 610. If AC on Switch will be your first AC game though then there is plenty to introduce you to things here and hopefully, in time, features lacking or outright missing will get put back because the game really needs some more depth and it is overdue some good DLCs."
Dcglide,"Nov 1, 2023",10,Si bien le faltó un poco de contenido si lo comparamos con el new leaf no deja de ser un juego espectacular.

Nepheyn,"Oct 23, 2023",2,"Maybe a good decoration game but a bad Animal Crossing in my opinion. Content events from previous games from which certain elements are removed, which gives the feeling of emptiness. Soulless villagers. Robotics PNG. Quite a few farming mechanics from mobile games. Lack of care on the mystery islands. Game too focused on social networks, photos in my taste. I loved what this serie of game was before, but now I don't. I don't forget also the removal of posters from the catalog to re-unlock them with Amiibo a month later and the removal of zoning... This game being a pioneer at this level with the aim of preventing having several islands on the same console also says a lot about respect and the consideration of the players. This series is no longer produced by people passionate about video games but financiers with objectives to achieve and start to be mainstream and viral with the people who like show what they do with the elements provided for decoration, by their prominence and cute and instagrammable side."
Roykya,"Sep 29, 2023",4,I play games to escape capitalism not to do raccoon capitalism.
Kingkal101,"Oct 19, 2023",5,"this game came out during lockdown, which explained why it got a huge amount of sales, but who actually plays this in 2023? i remeber loving this game in 2020, updates and just the diffrent approach this game took, you could edit your island in many diffrent ways which was never done in any other animal crossing but nintendo has killed this game in recent years, the game is very easily explioted, and you can get bots coming to your island to give you loads of good stuff, and nintendo stopped updating this game, it was good while it lasted"
kylecrossing,"Oct 19, 2023",10,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is probably my favourite game of all time. Putting aside its timely release during a period where we were stuck inside, I cannot help but go back to my island regularly, even though it’s been 3 years since its release.

The level of customisation on your island is impeccable, and the attention to detail never fails to impress. From the little secrets and easter eggs suffused throughout the game, down to the UI where each individual UI element has a unique sound effect attached to it. Details like these are a testament to the love, hard work, and effort poured into the game, and for that alone I personally think it deserves a 10.

The visuals are an aesthetic feast. I mean, the creatures have TOE BEANS. The graphics, although adorably simplistic, are intricate and realistic when they need to be (see: furniture and fish/bugs/sea creatures). There are so many villagers, both cute and kitsch, and they are filled to the brim with personality and charm. That is, if you have villagers with different personality types on your island.

Probably one of the few shortcomings of the game would be the lack of depth of the dialogue. Villagers with similar personality types or hobbies may end up repeating dialogue/spewing similar rhetoric as each other. If you’re like me and you enjoy talking to the same villager over and over until they get sick of it, you’ve probably had them repeat themselves a couple of times, or repeat the same sentence, just with a different randomised noun. That aside, villagers are nonetheless very fun to talk to and observe around the island, and I can’t help but smile when I see their little toes when they sit down. When you emote at them, they emote back too and that might be one of the greatest gifts technology has given us. Smug and lazy villagers tend to be my favourite, as the former tends to be charming and friendly, while the latter tries to make everything about food (some of the dialogue is genuinely funny).

Another little gripe I have is that they’ve watered down the mean dialogue in the game. I wish New Horizons had the sass and attitude the older games had, but I understand this decision was probably made to make the game more family friendly.

Overall, this game deserves to be game of the millennium. 10/10 gameplay, 10/10 plot, 10/10 music, 10/10 characters. 10000/10 housing debt.

My favourite character is Kyle btw. KYLE IS THE BEST CHARACTER. Peace"
dayglo80,"Oct 18, 2023",7,"I think this is a very generous review. I loved this game when it first came out, and it became quite the daily routine of cozy gaming time. Unfortunately, once Nintendo gave up on the game (early, I might add) my disappointment drove me from the game. Once in a while I stop and wonder how many bugs are occupying my house, or whether any of my villagers stuck around... they'll be fine."
Zeldacrafter2,"Oct 16, 2023",9,"It was a phenomenal game, but every animal crossing game will be in the shadow of new leaf."
FitnessCarrot,"Oct 15, 2023",0,"For me it is one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a long time, after playing **** Valley, a game that I had a lot of fun with, I thought this would also be something like that, but with animals and other types of activities, but this game is designed Only and only for people who play video games for very little time and who do not have any standards when it comes to playing them, the game is designed to be played for a very short time a day the first week and even later, a maximum of 3 hours a day.This is not a regular game where you can sit and play, progress through the game until you get tired, they really let you do a very low variety of things the first few days and it's super boring, collect wood and then make more tools to go look for some fossils and receive a speech from a damn owl, it's simply like a mobile game that you go in to play for a while and then move on to something else, you have to invent all the fun, the game doesn't help you. It offers nothing really fun, the NPCs don't have any charisma, the fishing and catching of insects is super slow and boring, it seems like a disaster to me as a video game, subjectivity has limits, I think it's an insult that it has a grade of 9, as if it were at the level of zelda breath of the wild as a video game, because the rating, despite being a system to give users an idea of what the game is like, is a global rating as a video game not by genre, so you are putting it next to a title that is 100 times better, even **** Valley itself gives it 10 kicks in terms of game design, it makes no sense, besides the fact that the game was made by a guy in his house alone."
Vigo,"Oct 12, 2023",8,"This was enjoyable, especially when covid hit and it's all you had to worry about. Almost as if they invented covid for this game. Maybe I'm not creative enough but tera-farming got overwhelming. Also lack of nintendo charcter related objects was a let down. Other than that I enjoyed my time with it."
FlameSlayer,"Oct 11, 2023",9,"I like this game. It's very chill and is very well made. It's like the old Animal Crossing games, except you build every building/shops such as Nook's Cranny, Able Sisters, the town hall and Blather's museum from scratch. You also need to build villagers' homes (3 starter villagers' only) from scratch. It's a great game to teach people to build everything from the get-go. It can also teach people basic survival skills such as fishing, bug catching and planting trees/flowers. As you progress in the game, the more you unlock. I recommend buying this game if you are looking for chill games or if you are a big-fan of the Animal Crossing series."

DiWhyReviews,"Oct 6, 2023",8,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the perfect game for a quiet night in!

Whether it’s cosying up on a rainy evening with a cup of tea or taking a mid-day break from work, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the perfect game in which to take your time and unleash your creativity. 

Set on a remote island, you are tasked by your in-game Tanuki guide: Tom Nook to renovate and elevate your new tropical home to whatever degree you see fit. Large mystical forests, or dark and dingy cities, the range of creativity available in this game is limitless. Along the way, you will encounter enchanting neighbours each with their own personalities and catchphrases who you can build friendship with and create a loving community. 

Coming from the original GameCube game: Animal Forest, Nintendo (creators of the animal crossing franchise) have built upon their original game not deviating from the original theme of decoration and collection. However, the game has evolved you from being a new neighbour on the block, to mayor & into being the island representative in the newest instalment. 
Animal Crossing: New Horizons was released in Mid-Late 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic that swept the globe, locking people within their homes with little to do but wait. Due to this, when Animal Crossing: New Horizons was released, it was a breath of fresh air in a time when the gaming scene and the world was so stagnant. This created a huge demand for the game and raised its popularity far into the gaming space, making it a best seller of 2020. Many games with this success would eventually die out due to issues with re-playability, however the massive creative outlet New Horizons presented meant that it has persisted as a popular game all the way into the present gaming space. 

Despite all this praise, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has lost many of its initial players because the game takes a lot of time to ‘complete’ in a sense. Some features of the game can take multiple days to complete, for example placing a Villager’s house or bridge can take 2 days: 1 to place, and 1 to build. This, coupled with the time taken to acquire certain items can mean that decorating your desired island can take weeks or months depending on your style and how much time you want to pour into the game itself. As well as this, many have complained that the dialogue from the villager characters has become robotic and emotionless in the newest game, which has strayed far from the original’s dialogue variety and sass.

However, this new instalment into the franchise is an overall success that has blossomed into a loving and friendly online community of everything from casual players to moders & content creators. It is the perfect game to put your mind at ease with its charming graphical style and relaxing music, and should be a recommended game for those with a Nintendo Switch. A definite 8.5 / 10 for me."
Marioipod13,"Oct 5, 2023",2,Garbage game that forces you to purchase an overpriced DLC for half the features

MrPresident1665,"Sep 17, 2023",0,This game literally drove my gerbil to commit seppuku. The graphics are so bad it looks like I’m watching my neighbor play the game through a dollar store telescope. This game is so boring it makes watching grass grow look like the Super Bowl. If I ever meet the team behind this game I will give each of them a wedgie and a swirly. This game is an EMBARRASSMENT to the community and I would rather guzzle mayonnaise than play one more crillasecond of it. If you want to play a game like this that doesn’t **** I would suggest **** valley or duke nukem forever on the ps3

zaratti,"Sep 1, 2023",9,"I always wanted to play Animal Crossing and this was my first one. I instantly fell in love with New Horizons with it's wonderfully calming music, satisfying gameplay loop, lovable NPCs  and the detailed decorating options you have. Overall, I love this game and would recommend it if you like slow games."
BertKA88,"Aug 29, 2022",8,When lockdown first started I was looking for something to play and everyone was playing this. I was 32 and thought it wasn’t for me but I gave it a go and 250 hours later I can definitely say I’m a fan of this franchise now. I love the creativity it affords you. I love sport so I made a soccer field and a sports store with custom jerseys. I visited other people to get all the fruit. I grew every type of flower. I played so much…
Massraider,"Aug 23, 2023",7,"A very short story. After passing it, I don't want to go into the game, there is no motivation. I don't see any point in playing for the sake of arranging the island and buying new things for the interior. This is for those who do not save their time."
assisjunior,"Aug 19, 2023",9,This game gave me peace and hope in a really dark time. I had so much fun and I will always cherish it.
sideshownate,"Aug 13, 2023",7,I will say that this game was very fun during covid and super refreshing. However when they quickly decided to stop updating after a year and re release the same updates every season thats when I quickly began to realize that nintendo did not care about this game as much as we did.
Gryesc,"Jul 25, 2023",8,"It's a fun game, see the island evolving, chat with characters and etc. The problem is that you have to wait long times to get better in the game, also, you get borred some time, so, don't get ACNH as your 1st game, but if you alredy have a game, buy it if it's ok to you wait 2 days to a in-game thing get done (sometimes) buy it."
Bugjam8,"Jul 22, 2023",0,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons es un juego querido por muchos, pero también tiene algunos aspectos negativos que podrían desanimar a ciertos jugadores:

1. Jugabilidad lenta: El ritmo del juego puede ser muy relajado, lo que puede resultar aburrido o tedioso para aquellos que buscan una experiencia de juego más rápida y emocionante.

2. Dependencia del tiempo real: Animal Crossing: New Horizons opera en tiempo real, lo que significa que ciertas actividades y eventos están vinculados al reloj interno del juego. Esto podría limitar la cantidad de contenido disponible en una sola sesión de juego y frustrar a aquellos que prefieren jugar de manera más intensa y sin restricciones de tiempo.

3. Interacción limitada con los aldeanos: Aunque los aldeanos son una parte importante del juego, la interacción con ellos puede sentirse repetitiva y limitada en comparación con otras mecánicas del juego. Algunos jugadores podrían desear una mayor profundidad en las relaciones con los aldeanos y más opciones de diálogo.

4. Escasez de contenido inicial: Al comienzo del juego, la cantidad de contenido y opciones disponibles puede ser limitada, lo que podría llevar a una sensación de falta de progresión o satisfacción en las primeras etapas del juego.

5. Personalización limitada: A pesar de que el juego ofrece opciones de personalización, algunos jugadores podrían desear una mayor variedad de artículos, muebles y opciones de diseño para crear un mundo más único y atractivo.

Es importante tener en cuenta que estas críticas son subjetivas y que Animal Crossing: New Horizons ha sido muy bien recibido por su enfoque relajado y encantador. Sin embargo, estos aspectos negativos pueden ser considerados como desventajas para ciertos jugadores que buscan una experiencia de juego más dinámica y con mayores opciones de personalización e interacción. Como siempre, se recomienda a los jugadores investigar y considerar sus preferencias personales antes de tomar una decisión de compra."
voiceofreason69,"Jul 22, 2023",10,"the game is awesome, tbh the people who rate it low are trolls or people who don't like the progression system, if you don't like being unable to grind, don't buy a 60$ game where your limited to a few hours a day. This game is very good, and has a peaceful feel that I enjoy, the only flaw is its limits to grinding, but again, if you like grinding, then don't buy it, it ain't for you"
Dinkles,"Jul 15, 2023",10,"I love this game.
I think this game is great, I love the relaxing music, chill vibe, eye candy, and lovable characters. I think the ONLY TWO things wrong with this game is that it is very expensive and, very slow at times but that is how the game is supposed to be.  It is a nice relaxing time and I would recommend this to anyone who has a stressful life. Anyone who thinks this game is bad have absolutely HORRIBLE taste."
TheRedFern,"Jul 8, 2023",9,"Every interaction, every character, every element of this game was thought out and made with the most adorable choice possible.

tensioly,"Jun 6, 2023",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons se ha convertido en uno de mis juegos favoritos. Tras 150 horas de juego sigo divirtiéndome jugándolo como el primer día. Es un juego divertidísimo, con una jugabilidad tranquila y satisfactoria y con muchas cosas por hacer. El apartado técnico es muy bueno y estable (teniendo en cuenta las limitaciones de la Switch), el artístico es simplemente excepcional y la música es muy relajante. La historia es tremendamente simple pero sirve como tutorial para empezar a jugar; y el multijugador con amigos puede hacer del juego una experiencia espectacular. Además, la hora del juego se ajusta a la de la realidad, algo que puede ser bueno, par dividir las horas entre distintos días, o malo, ya que te ""obliga"" a conectarte para obtener los beneficios de cada día. Entre otras cosas malas está el hecho de que a algunas personas se les puede hacer repetitivo, la escasez de diálogos e interacciones con los vecinos y la falta de nuevo contenido de anteriores ediciones de Animal Crossing. Muy recomendable para todas las edades. 9,2/10

detourdude,"Jun 2, 2023",7,"This is a great game, but it's killed in the late game where there's not really much to do. This game could've benefitted from having more content. The game basically died off because there wasn't enough to do. It's a very fun and addicting game, so it's easy to reach a point where there's no goals besides your personal goals and once you reach those, the game is basically over for you."
Sidus56743,"May 29, 2023",4,"The villagers feel so soulless. There is just nothing story-wise to do. A lot of content from older titles is just gone. It can feel like a cozy home sometimes, but I feel isolated on this island in the middle of nowhere."
Poccigoni,"May 25, 2023",6,"New Horizons is an example of how to NOT manage a game.
The game starts like any other AC game. You arrive at a small town (in this case an island) and from there on you have to improve your house and your town: make bridges, plant flowers, build furniture. And releasing a social hangout game in the COVID-19 pandemic was the best move that Nintendo could have ever done, and they knew it. They knew that the game could potentially be one of the biggest games of all time. But Nintendo did not manage it correctly.
The game offers the player freedom. Now, this is a good thing. The problem is that this game offers the player TOO MUCH freedom. You shouldn't be able to modify your villagers house, you shouldn't be able to place whatever furniture you feel like. The game should be called Animal Crossing: New Utopia, because you basically just create whatever island you feel like. Mix it with the ridiculously low amount of content compared to NL, lame updates and you've got the recipe for a disaster. I cannot manage to place it below a 6 because I've still enjoyed the game, and the first few weeks are great. But after that, it just becomes what I've stated before. And it is kinda sad, because it had the potential to be the best AC game yet."
Grevproduction,"May 25, 2023",8,"It’s very addictive game, despite you only get updates per year. But nonetheless it’s pretty good."
William_Trigos,"May 14, 2023",8,"It's great to create your island, gather more neighbors, get all kinds of fish bugs etc.

The worst thing about the game is the online issue, it has loading times and waiting for a game that is not from this century. It should be more worked apart from the fact that it is missing a lot of content and things from previous installments

I still recommend it"
Broyax,"May 14, 2023",0,"Mais… qu’est-ce que c’est que ce truc, mon petit bonhomme ? une espèce de… jeu de survie à la mords-moi-le-noeud ? sur une île déserte à la con mais avec tout le confort quand même, la tente, le smartdaube, les gentils organisateurs et tout ça… le club merde pour les nuls, en somme ?

Ou plus simplement le Con Lanta tranquillou (sans les épreuves) ou bien le Merdecraft façon Nintendaube, édition Switche ! avec les graphismes en 16 couleurs, la présentation volontiers… comment dire ? un peu mongolo-triso ou un truc dans le genre, tu vois. De toute façon, c'est un jeu de communistes avec des  drôles d'animaux qui parlent en accéléré dans leurs bulles… un peu névrosés, si tu veux mon avis.

Et donc… quoi donc au fait, là-dedans ? à part ramasser des merdes pour en fabriquer d’autres et ainsi de suite… ad nauseam. Il paraît que c’est taillé pour le multi-kévins et le multi-casus. Et aussi le multi-bobos, car sur Switch, le public est surtout bobo-casual. Viens visiter mon île ? mais je m’en fous de ton île en fait. T’as cueilli combien de pommes ? attrapé des papillons ? si t’as favriqué le machin pour les ****…

Ou t’as pêché de la poiscaille peut-être… si encore ils expliquaient ces cons-là comment qu’on fait… parce que là, c’est ‘démerde-toi’. C’est un peu trop souvent mal fait ou peu ou pas expliqué. Comment virer cette musique de merde, par exemple ? bah tu peux pas ! Mais de toute manière, on se lasse très vite de cette connerie de petit jeu à la con : plus répétitif, tu meurs !"
Pollee,"May 11, 2023",10,i wish sonic the hedgehog was in this... it would make it lots more exciting eeee eeee great game overall
kingrat3,"May 10, 2023",7,"While the game itself is great, really relaxing and gorgeous,
But it **** that you can only have 1 island per console. I spent so many hours on my island and the game was fun but now I have nothing to do because I don't want to reset my 140 hour island and they don't update at all anymore. I wish I could make a second island and enjoy the game again."
Chileoz,"Apr 28, 2023",8,It is a Phenomenal game in 2020 during the pandemic. I don't suggest anyone play it now and I also don't think any other similar game will achieve similar outcomes.
bochuu,"Apr 24, 2023",7,"Issable was hype when she got in Smash Bros, but she isn't fun to play as/against. the game is pretty oki tho"
acethebased,"Apr 10, 2023",9,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this.  It's really fun.  It gets a little boring once your island gets to 3 stars, but it's still a 9 for me."
oopkp,"Apr 1, 2023",0,"Oh my god... What can I even say... 2020's Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a game that is very different from its predecessors. To make an analogy: If the old games were like pizza, this is a calzone. There are similarities, but they are still very distinct from each other. But this analogy falls apart in one area: calzones are still made by Francis Ford Coppola, BUT THIS GAME IS NOT!"
Sonkisfast,"Mar 16, 2023",8,"New Horizons is a beautiful game, and came out at a time where people needed a place to find comfort in. This game is filled to the brim with personality! The gameplay is relaxing and addicting, the characters are fun and goofy, and decorating your house is a lovely way to pass time!"
HazeAbysmal,"Mar 13, 2023",9,"The memories this game and I share are some of the best gaming memories I've ever had, period. I can never truly dismis this game for that alone, and I still enjoy hoping back on it from time to time with friends online. Truly one of the best animal crossing games, not as good as new leaf, but still a good time."
TheQweast,"Mar 3, 2023",8,Very fun game to chill on if you can keep up with it. Once you leave it for a long while it can be daunting to tidy everything back up. Getting villagers you want can also be a hassle but the pure customization of your island is phenomenal.
Lombino88,"Feb 27, 2023",3,"I think Nintendo ruined the game i bought it for 65 euros and its not worth the price honestly i overhyped the game it can get boring really quickly i had it over for 2 months and my island looks like crap. And the other problem is lack of content that is mostly the reason the game is boring and you need to build the villagers house and takes a lot of time of farming materials.I literally have to force my self to play the game because its been sitting in my case for 2 months. Sooo final conclusion the game problems
:lack of content
Too pricy
Too boring
Overhyped
So this is what i think but some people like the game but im unfortunately one of the people who didn't like the game:("
RIbbotreview,"Feb 17, 2023",10,"I did not think that the newest animal crossing game would be so fun, relaxing AND groundbreaking! This game is one of the games that made 2020 (the covid-19 pandemic) fun. This should be 100% a must buy for the Nintendo switch."
SpeziaLunare,"Feb 16, 2023",3,"After 30 minutes you'll wish to be Kratos to tear apart those three damn raccoons. Boring, boring and boring. Not relaxing, just a bad way to waste your time."
CTAN,"Feb 14, 2023",10,"I'm late to play this game, such a great gaming experience I've been enjoying so much. Its a slow and steady game to build up friendship and township with the others. Sometimes I'm tired off playing stressful games, and ACNH is the perfect platform for me to destress from my works"
Cronodougs,"Feb 14, 2023",9,"Animal Crossing is what makes Nintendo unique and delivers something that is virtually infinite. I have 900 hours and notes given by Haters who Only have Xbox and never played it are useless.

Literally a wonderful, welcoming game without that disgusting slaughter of current franchises."
AshuraZoro,"Feb 13, 2023",10,"I think lot of people dont like it, becouse its not an action game, but its one of the best game in the console"
Dyl_lionaire,"Feb 11, 2023",7,"After hearing the praises of this game, I caved in and bought it and well I thought it was alright, The art style is clean and the characters are fun but I personally didn't click as well as others but meeting with friends for holiday events was all I could've asked for."
xxAcesHighxx,"Feb 10, 2023",9,"After more than 200 hours I can safely say that New Horizons, my first Animal Crossing game, has made me a fan of the franchise and I couldn’t be happier with how this entry turned out on Switch. Gorgeous visuals, smooth performance and an addicting gameplay loop make this a stellar game and one of the very best Switch titles to date. Highly recommended."
Faksnap1000,"Feb 7, 2023",4,Is it a game or just a stupid time waster? My review score shows you what I think.
Ako4ik,"Feb 6, 2023",10,Chill live nothing very good but too much chill make island and chill only chill
Neiqq,"Feb 6, 2023",10,"10/10 game, i adore it, i get to be creative in a whole new way, its just such a calming and feel good game. i have 1500+ hours in it and i intent to keep playing!"
PotatoePink,"Feb 1, 2023",10,The best animal crossing game ever.  Would recommend to any casual video game enjoyer.
Woodyus,"Jan 29, 2023",0,Terrible design decision on one switch user able to progress the story. What a waste of money and children upset.
FilipYeah,"Jan 27, 2023",10,Top 3 video games EVER. You WILL play this game for at least 150 hours or if your like me 500 hours.
Dragoduval,"Jan 23, 2023",5,"Its not a bad game, but it does get boring after a few days / weeks. Not worth the full price."
Filuko,"Jan 14, 2023",10,"One of the best switch games I’ve ever played.
It helps me during the COVID 19 lockdown!"
SatinFoil,"Jan 1, 2023",7,"When I first got this game back in March 2020, I got super addicted to this game! Really fun and if you have a switch, I recommend getting it! Especially if you haven't tried animal crossing games before, as if you get bored (you will see why I said that in a sec), you might be motivated to try the other animal crossing games! However, I started to get bord of playing after completing my island. And by that, I meant I didn't play it as much as before. I still played it really activly due to the active updates. (And I'm sure you see where this is going.) about a month or so after they released the 2.0 update aka the final update, I got bord and had nothing to modivate me to play it. Once that happend, I started playing new leaf (the previous animal crossing game) on my 3DS, and enjoyed that a lot more then new horizons (after the final update). Another pro to the 3DS version, is that you can buy more save files, aka, buy more animal crossing carts (as on 3DS, games you bought on retail have the save data stored on the cart, while new horizons the save data is stored on the system either way, I think), so that means, one save file per cart. You may wonder ""why don't you just delete your save data?"" Well, if you do that, shortly after, you will relize the mistake you made, and will get nostolgic for your oid town (in acnl its towns, not islands), so its worth the extra money. I'm going to stop now, because its becoming more of an acnl review more than an acnh review.

Conclusion: It was fun while it lasted, but I prefer new leaf right now."
Sinnoh-best,"Dec 30, 2022",9,"Addicting, fun, and clever. It has a wide array of options to do and can create your island in many amazing ways, The only issue, that hinders the experience, is ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH. Want a new island? You got to delete it and save it for the dream address."
Crimson9,"Dec 25, 2022",5,"This game doesn't have a lot going for it. Its pretty bad in almost every single way, and is worse than pretty much all its predecessors and the similar games.

On the other hand, its very cute."
BlueSonicCritic,"Dec 22, 2022",0,"For any amateur gamers who devotee there hobby to this game, play something else."
Divad27,"Dec 18, 2022",5,"It's nice and fun the first few hours, when you spend more than 10/15 hours depending on the rhythm it becomes repetitive and boring (in my case obviously). There comes a point where the only thing you can do every day is go in, take the fruits and go out, on the fifth day you stop going in. This is not a problem as such because many people do like this idea, the problem comes from Nintendo itself, which has not been able to exploit the game that has been so successful, they have barely updated it in 2 years, leaving it dead since the a few months after his departure. Beyond that, collecting fish or bugs is fun if you like to collect, you can also spend time decorating your island or your house, yes, it is an activity for a very specific audience. It's not a bad game, but a bad job from the company."
Alvelian,"Dec 15, 2022",6,"Игра выполнена в милом мультяшном стиле однако персонаж в ней выглядит как полный урод. Создать красивого человека просто невозможно, при это большинство животных выглядят довольно привлекательно. В остальном же визуал это скорее положительный аспект игры.
Весь геймплей это гринд - руби деревья, собирай всякое добро с пляжа или в лесу, сажай огород, и рыбачь. И все это сильно бесит уже через час, тк каждое действие сопровождается 5ти секундной нескипаемой анимацией. Кроме того из-за невозможности вращать камерой многие объекты в игре невозможно разглядеть ( в том же **** valley деревья становятся прозрачными когда ты заходишь за них), что вызывает невозможность нормально с ними взаимодействовать.
В игре большое количство одежды и предметов для кастемизации своих поселений и это радует, но рутина которой приходится заниматься ради их получения просто выжигает тебя.
В целом игра неплохая но явно оверхайпнутая."
sevendg6,"Dec 11, 2022",0,"Our today's discovery makes us regret to have bought this game.
warning to every future buyers :
There's only one island per console
There's only one account who can advance in the main progression.
every other players from the family will be blocked by this.
This main account issue isn't fixable as you won't be able to switch the main account afterward.
Dig a bit on internet, you'll see that's a massive issue reported by players, to whom nintendo decided not to respond.
Shame on you nintendo"
spencerplewe,"Dec 9, 2022",8,"A pick-up-and-play friendly sandbox game that respects your time but gives back graciously from it, AC:NH is inoffensive, relaxing, and liberating with how much design control you have."
CodaHensley,"Dec 2, 2022",5,"A very addicting game when you're doing the 100% grind and logging on every day, but the minute you take a step back and realize how pointless the things you're doing and how long it will take you, it becomes pretty disheartening. A cute game, but plenty of games are cute. Animal Crossing is just a time sink, plain and simple."
Zeldacrafter,"Nov 28, 2022",10,"It’s an amazing game, one of my favorite switch games, and it is a wonderful experience, however if you have an older console most of the other animal crossing games are better, however if you have a switch this should be one of the first 10 games you get."

Extra Notes: Not really my type of game, I only put a few hours into the game and got quite bored of doing various simple, not challenging tasks; I just don't like slice of life games, and didn't put enough time into this one"
Emperator_444,"Nov 19, 2022",10,"Me encanta cómo lleva más allá la mecánica de New Leaf de construir proyectos, esta vez permitiéndonos colocar muebles por la isla, esto permite personalizarla muchísimo. Además, poder cambiar el terreno y el agua es maravilloso.
Me parece que gráficamente se ve genial.
El juego logra hacer lo que busca.
El único punto negativo que veo es no poder crear más de una isla por consola, entiendo que esto lo hicieron de esta manera para que amigos y familiares pudiesen vivir en la misma isla, pero yo tengo mi isla organizada de una manera que no quiero que nadie perturbe. También echo en falta a algunos personajes."
EmptyPeanut,"Nov 13, 2022",6,The game feels a little bit empty but its gorgeous and unique aesthetically.
Sterrewiggelary,"Nov 12, 2022",10,The game that saved me during lockdown. Incredibly chill and easy to play. Perfect for any and all.
Minus_Infinity,"Nov 4, 2022",6,"I think this game is good, it just takes too long for anything important to happen. Waiting days and days for stuff that should take 5 minutes."
baja_dan,"Oct 27, 2022",8,"The first Animal Crossing game I've ever played. At first this series didn't interest me, but I decided to give it a try during the pandemic and I'm glad I did. The gameplay loop is really relaxing and easy. I found the game to appear deceptively simple, until you learn about all the available mechanics and how you can utilize them to build your island and progress further. I enjoyed the quaintness of the game, but I understand the criticism it recieves. I enjoyed my 120hr playthrough of the game and I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a chill, relaxing game."
the4ears,"Oct 24, 2022",2,这个制作组有着精神病一般的控制欲，无论制作物品还是要出行都要强制你点击数次。游戏网络部分和交互部分更是在最低端的水准。
ZangBang,"Oct 24, 2022",2,"25/100
Animal Crossing New Horizons emphasizes the customization aspect of the experience more than ever before, giving players the option to place indoor furniture outside as well, but most importantly the power to shape the island's landscape to create rivers, cliffs or change the appearance of specific ground tiles. This greatly enchances the decor possibilities, as well as providing much more furniture and clothing options than New Leaf. Even with this, New Leaf offered many more shops and a greater sense of progression with time, whereas New Horizons's town feels stale and empty with only a couple of shops and almost no upgrades. Compounding this problem are villagers, offering an embarassingly low amount of lines of dialogue that start repeating themselves after mere weeks. Furthermore, their personalities have been simplified and infantilized, leaving most interactions feeling artificial. The new crafting mechanic tries to add some flavor to the acquiring of items and furniture through resource management, but its great potential isn't explored nearly enough as it ends up being more of an annoyance, with tools breaking too often. With all these downgrades, uncertain new mechanics and the usual repetitive nature of Animal Crossing's core activities, New Horizons ends up being little more than a visually pleasing but hollow display of aesthetics and virtual possessions."
Daffodil,"Oct 17, 2022",10,"Animal crossing is amazing, open world game. A family friendly Nintendo game; an amazing escape from reality and it released when it was needed most."
BritainButNot,"Oct 6, 2022",5,"After around 150 hours of playing, it pains me to give such a low score. But ACNH simply failed to meet many of the reasonable expectations that previous entries gave fans. New Horizons was a less complete, polished, and expansive game than New Leaf at launch, despite the latter releasing almost a decade earlier on far inferior hardware. Not to mention the the island aesthetic feels oddly isolated and claustrophobic."
munichi_jasuda,"Oct 6, 2022",3,"Game started off so well, exactly as it was advertised. You arrive at a deserted island and help build a small settlement, but after about a week or two, suddenly the entire focus changes to decorating the island.

This game apparently is branded as ""life sim"", but it feels purely like an island-decorating tool after you are done with the very short tutorial phase. It had so much potential to add more life-sim elements through updates, but the developers couldn't be bothered to support it, even though the game is one of the best-selling titles on switch, with about 40 million copies sold so far."
MISHM3SH,"Sep 28, 2022",10,I love the game it is extremely relaxing and fun! Can be quite hard to find items but trading sites like nookazon make it easy! It can be a wee hit grindy tho! But thats fine cuz in quartine  it helped pass the time!
PacoBN23,"Sep 24, 2022",6,"El hecho de poder terraformar tu isla y hacer literalmente lo que tú quieras te da mucha libertad y, sobre todo, alarga el juego hasta horas infinitas. Por otro lado, el hecho de que tenga fácilmente más de 20000 objetos para decorar hace que el nivel de personalización que ofrece sea enorme.
No obstante, el hecho de que sólo pueda haber una isla por consola y que el juego sólo se destine al jugador principal limita mucho a los demás."
MunhozMCM,"Sep 19, 2022",9,"My Score:

(9) - Great!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------"
ZeoN,"Sep 12, 2022",9,"Con New Horizons nos encontramos con un Animal Crossing cuidado a escala milimétrica. Es un juego muy recomendado no solo para los fans de la saga, si no también para los amantes del mundo Nintendo.
Su banda sonora es algo repetitiva al principio hasta desbloquear todas sus músicas, la variedad de herramientas y crafteos es muy alto y sus mecánicas de decoración y relación con el entorno se hacen muy divertidas y adictivas.
Me parece uno de los mejores lanzamientos de los últimos años. No le pongo el 10 por sus problemas de rendimiento, pero es sobresaliente."
Stypehtt85,"Aug 22, 2022",9,"Este es un Animal Crossing a la altura de los demás juegos de la franquicia, con diferentes experiencias de juego. Un juego muy carismático, aunque a veces se siente como un trabajo jugarlo en vez de relajarte. Pero si nunca has jugado a esta saga, te recomiendo probarlo ¡¡Es un buen título!!

ehtaco,"Aug 13, 2022",6,"I feel like Nintendo tanked this game quicker than it needed to with the terrible seasonal updates and whatnot. They got lazy and lowkey straight-up lied and falsely advertised the longevity of this game in terms of 'new' content. The ""one island per Switch"" thing is also pure garbage. Feel like this game deserves a 4-6/10 due to the wasted potential here, but I can't deny the amount of time both my girlfriend and I put into it. Though she probably had a much better experience acting as ""player one"" and essentially being the person who had full control of the island. Being P2 on someone else's island blows."
Jaime_SC,"Jul 24, 2022",7,"I've been playing this game for 2 years now. I think it's a good game, and you'll have fun playing it the first months . You can customize your island the way you like and I love that, and the game is visually fantastic. However, I don't like the lack of especial events and activities in New Horizons. In my opinion, It was funnier to play with friends in New Life, because it had the Island where you could meet people and do mini games there. It's a shame that New Horizons won't have more major updates, the game has a lot of potential to be abandoned just in 2 years."
DolphinReviews,"Jul 20, 2022",1,"Animal Crossing is not for everyone. I am one of those people. Life sims have never been my cup of tea and was hoping this game would change that, however it did not. The graphics are decent but leave a lot to be desired compared to the charm of previous titles. The gameplay is extremally boring and repetitive. I felt as I was wasting my life away playing this game. I could be out living my life or playing a better game, but instead I was simulating a taxing dull life."
svonton,"Jul 17, 2022",7,"Actual name of this game is ""Timegate events: the game"". continuation of the review will be available tomorrow ...."
Striker7745,"Jul 6, 2022",10,"This game looks a bit cute for adults to play like most Nintendo games, however the gameplay is totally awesome and extremely addictive! Nintendo has put a LOT of work into Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the amount of thought and detail put into the game is truly amazing, it's very highly polished and, totally bug free (coding wise lol), and looks incredible on the Switch OLED screen. This is a MUST BUY if you own a Switch, it's a masterpiece! The only negatives I can say about the game is 1) you can it get involved in online play unless you know someone else with the game 2) it would be good if the graphics became transparent if your character is hidden behind a cliff, house or tree."
sarahaj,"Jul 2, 2022",7,"While a wonderful experience, I feel this game is incomplete without some of the quality of life changes that were made in the previous game. While you will no doubt find yourself pulled into this experience for 100 hours or so, at the end, you may feel it shallow. Couple that with repetitive dialogue that was done better on the DS release Wild World I cannot help but find myself slightly disappointed."
Nintendist,"Jul 2, 2022",10,this game is so beautiful and good. i love every detail here. this game runs lovely
waywardlaser,"Jun 28, 2022",10,"It's frustrating how this is simultaneously the best entry in the series while still lacking a ton of features that made the others so great. I can say I've sunk over 400 hours into New Horizons alone, which is far more than what can be said for any in the series since the original. New Leaf is cool, but can you play it on a TV? Nope."
landi,"Jun 27, 2022",0,"Way to boring for my taste. Switched to ""**** Valley"" instead as this game simply is to less and a waste of time."
dislexicpotato,"Jun 27, 2022",9,"One of the best games on the Switch, beautiful visuals, cool new features and countless hours of enjoyment."
donmopa,"Jun 27, 2022",8,"Considering the amount of time that I've spent in this one, it deserve the score. At the beginning looks like a very stupid game, and indeed it is, however, then it became so additive. Maybe, some mechanics needs to be improved, but it is still pretty fun"
stupidopinion,"Jun 22, 2022",8,"I haven't really played this game in quite some time. It really got me through parts of 2020, being a very relaxing town-building/decorating game. Visiting other people's islands is a nice feature and I have a lot of great memories because of it, but it would be foolish to say the online is good. The game itself struggles occasionally with performance, especially from heavily decorated islands/online islands, and it takes forever to visit other islands. The lack of updates has been disappointing for someone who really liked filling out the museum with fish, art, insects, and fossils. Design features for the museum and additional artifacts to collect would definitely bring me back, but it seems they have no interest. If you enjoy a slow-paced relaxing experience with plenty of design options this game is definitely for you though. I had a lot of fun with this and the free DLC through switch online is actually pretty great if you like decorating.

Negative points for the single island ""feature"" though. It's still a baffling decision, like why not allow accounts the option to choose between joining an old island and making a new one?"
darklanx,"Jun 18, 2022",0,"Nintendo: ""New contents coming soon.""
Also Nintendo: ""No more contents for our best-selling game."""
LuissDt,"Jun 4, 2022",10,"I'm not going to lie, the hatred towards the game was justified but now, New Horizons is a fun and satisfying mix in these times of pandemic that makes it the best animal crossing in the saga"
madplayer11,"May 27, 2022",0,"Do not buy this game if you plan to share it with others on one console. Seriously, don't, it will be waste of your money. You can have only one shared island per switch device, and first player is the ""host"", so only they can progress through plot and even get needed recipies for building furniture for villagers.
If you have kids, they will fight about it and this game will be only source of arguments and discontent, not as enjoyable as shown on trailers."
smahlt,"May 21, 2022",5,"It's fine. It misses out on a lot of the charm the earlier games in the series had. The earlier games felt like ""here is a world, you are any average resident"", while this one is completely centered around you. The fun of Animal Crossing is firing it up and finding out what's happening today, while in this one, nothing happens unless you make it happen."
Gary-Chess,"May 15, 2022",0,It is extremely misleading that this game advertises itself as a multiplayer game. If you are the 2nd player then you need to buy a whole new Switch console to actually play it. I really wish I knew this before I purchased. This is a very underhanded business tactic and it really makes me apprehensive to buy other games from Nintendo. Paying $400 per extra player on top of the cost of the game is a joke.
DavidMinnt,"May 11, 2022",10,The Best Animal Crossing Game! I Know that make only 1 **** the Game is **** 5.6 User Score!? What Happend with You? Must Played!
maxgreat73,"May 11, 2022",10,"I just cannot stop playing. It's cute, it's fun and you always have something to do.
The DLC is good without being great, but still, adds a lot of fun."
fijisami,"May 9, 2022",0,This game is 1 island per console which is very anti-consumer if you have multiple people that use your switch. It's also boring.
Wasefertz,"May 8, 2022",8,This game is fantastic. A beautiful graphic and so many sweet characters. But there is a big problem: the text. The're so many text passages which are absolute useless. That is bad. But the rest is near perfect.
Zumbie101,"May 7, 2022",8,"Game is fun and the customization compared to older titles is really nice. The gameplay is still fun though gets old quickly after a while, though get thats what the game goes for though it feels like you are just refreshing the shop for an item you might actually want eventually.

A chill game to just chill out with. I do find the villagers in this one to be very dull and uninteresting and that was what kept me playing before, only so many fossils you can dig up."
seno721,"May 6, 2022",7,This is a amazing game with plenty of fun to be had! But the issue comes if you started with the game where it becomes less appealing and more of a chore to play and hard to come back too and almost overwhelming with there now being lots of weeds and new features! Overall its a fun game i just wish the game came out with all the content at the start rather than adding them later

As systems moved on so did the versions of Animal Crossing. This is easily my favourite. You can fish, swim, and customize more than ever before."

opnyx,"Mar 22, 2022",9,"Awesome game. Very relaxing, lots of content and nice customization tools. Must-have if you want a game to play a bit every evening after a hard day at work (I played almost 300 hours and I'm not bored at all, still many things to do)."
MCETJ,"Mar 21, 2022",8,"The game is fun. Sure there are some problems with the controls, but with a little bit of time you can feel familiar with this."
Wrecktangled,"Mar 17, 2022",3,The love **** Valley and Harvest Moon type games. So i thought for sure this would be right up my alley. Turned out to be way too tedious and felt more like chores than anything else. The relationships werent engaging enough me either. Maybe this game requires a bit more creativity out of the player than I was willing to bring to the table. But overall it left me feeling disappointed.
TinkerConfig,"Mar 17, 2022",0,"I wished I'd looked at metacritic before buying this game. Single island per Switch with no workarounds was deeply upsetting to my daughter who doesn't get to have her own full experience with the game. Will never be looking at an Animal Crossing game again since they clearly don't know how design software. It's not like additional players are even full players in their own right, they are gated behind the progress of the first person to play. PANTS ON HEAD STUPID.

There's no excuse for this."

Meiner Meinung nach das beste Animal crossing Spiel und es kann ewig gespielt werden"
Jollyolfun,"Mar 16, 2022",9,this is a rating from when it initially came out but this game embodies cozy relaxation.
BannerSiamang15,"Mar 10, 2022",9,This game is boring. All you do is fish and talk to annoying villagers while collecting every single thing because I can't just sell something I might want to use it later. That being said this is the best game ever.
Moxiberry,"Mar 9, 2022",3,"The games Atmosphere feels incredibly off, its enough to where I cant stand playing the game at all and I think the game has no substance once you get the town hall, from that point on the game becomes so boring all it is really is just decorating your island which got boring extremally quickly and not even your villagers are interesting there just boring bland stereotypes, despite me hating a lot of new horizons I like the graphics and the music is okay but mediocre I love the new diverse clothing options and a lot of the furniture looks really nice but I feel as though it didn't warrant so many original classic furniture sets being removed, I just really hate this game its the worst I rank this game at the bottom of the barrel its worse than amiibo festival at least it felt like a animal crossing game"
micro10k,"Mar 9, 2022",10,"#1 best of Animal Crossing
My favorite game!
It´s many much hours! game is perfect!"
JayconUnlimited,"Mar 5, 2022",9,"I absolutely love Animal Crossing New Horizons. The graphics are gorgeous and I have fond memories of creating my custom island through quarantine. However, I can't say this game is better than New Leaf. Once I got burned out, I really got burned out. I never had that problem with New Leaf. If I went back to New Leaf, I would love it. If I came back to New Horizons, I'd be terrified to open the tab. The reason why New Horizons felt dry after a while was because the game didn't do anything new when I unlocked K K Slider. After that you get terraforming which is really nice. I used terraforming for a couple days, I got content with my island's layout and that was it. However, don't take this review as me disliking the game because I clearly don't. It's so beautiful and relaxing and I'd recommend it highly for fans."
FloofGaming,"Mar 1, 2022",3,"I’ve enjoyed my time with new horizons a ton I loved how they improved on customization and things of the sort but there are many sore thumbs that stick out to me being a long time fan, one is how any other accounts on the switch are forced to share an island now this isn’t a big problem for me as I’m the only one who plays but it is a big problem in terms of progressing as you can’t help out to expand the island, only the first person can cause a lot of hassle, so the rating loses a point from that, then secondly it feels like most of the loved furniture sets aren’t even in the game and with that it feels empty along with multiple NPCs missing it just makes me feel like this game was rushed even though in reality it was worked on for a long time, it feels bad to be harsh like this but there’s just a couple of big negatives that pushed the score down for me

Edit: back after almost 2 years, I'm dropping my score quite a bit now. The new updates were a step in the right direction but overall didn't fix the game's primary issue and that was longevity.
The longevity of this game wasn't good when compared to new leaf and I believe that's due to the very limited selection of items and overall barely any progression system.
Sure they added froggy chair back but still loved item sets never came back and felt replaced by less charming items. Then the shop never got anymore upgrades along with no other buildings on the island being added, it was a big disappointment hearing they would stop the free updates and it felt like they took our money and ran with it.

This is the worst animal crossing game to get started with and would recommend the older ones opposed to this."
mariohitsBlock,"Feb 28, 2022",9,"The best Animal Crossing game I have played. I've played other Animal Crossing games before, but this one tops out as the best. You get to relax on an island while doing other tasks for Tom Nook and Isabelle. The new DLC they released recently is very cool and the fact that you can carry the new features you did there to your island is awesome. A very good game to buy if you're an Animal Crossing fan."
elijahlape,"Feb 27, 2022",10,"This game saved me from going completely mad during the first wave of the pandemic. I can't even express how important this game is for me. Thank you to Nintendo, ACNH will forever has a special place in my heart!"

fanmadeendings,"Feb 16, 2022",8,"I can only rate this as a single player experience, and for what it is, it would be a 9 or even a 10, because it's such cozy fun - But the one save file per system thing really blows."
sergioodoardi,"Feb 13, 2022",10,I love how chill and beautiful this game is. Totally recommended for the people who want to relax after playing shooters or something competitive online.
Entrolux7715,"Feb 12, 2022",10,"This game is probably one of Nintendo's best. It is as of now the best Animal Crossing game. There are a few flawed areas. The Vilagers are a bit bland and say the same things after a while, to the point where it gets boring to talk to them. The game is more forgiving than older titles, but it also lacks a lot of the flavor. But the pros outweigh the cons, and you can sink so many hours into it without even realizing it"
Phuz,"Feb 11, 2022",0,"I hated watching it and definitely didn't want to play it. I have **** Valley at a pretty high level and when I get to where I want to be with it, I wanted another farming sim. Now I watched various people play this and it was so childish and irritating, I found it infuriating just listening and watching.

Now I gave my Rune Factory 4 an hour tester to see what that has to offer. Now it doesn't look a patch on **** but it was much better than Animal Crossing."
orangeinferno,"Feb 7, 2022",0,"Absolutely disgusting that not only do all players share an island but only ONE PLAYER PER CONSOLE actually gets the real game experience. I let my girlfriend who is much less **** play first so she could name the island, not realizing I was dooming myself to be completely unable to progress through the game in any way since she only plays about once a week and was not aware of any of the missions required to unlock new content. The gameplay itself deserves a far better rating but I will not stand for this lazy, greedy, reprehensible, and pathetic excuse for a first party release. Nintendo should be ashamed this game is released under their name with such a despicable multiplayer system."
Ka1dowskiX,"Feb 7, 2022",9,"The game, as a representative of the Animal Crossing series, offers interesting gameplay and is highly addictive. New Horizons offers wonderful graphic style, countless possibilities of modifying the island and highly controversial multiplayer aspect. Pointless limitations in this mode are a drawback of this game, but apart from that it is a wonderful experience recommended both for children and adults."
albegres,"Feb 5, 2022",8,"84/100

shw079,"Feb 4, 2022",7,"The game is alright, but get tedious very soon. It is not the type of game for me."
BlestTiger97489,"Feb 2, 2022",8,"This is a great game if you play on your own Switch, not so much if you share a Switch. The same screen multiplayer is not very great and people who join the island later miss out on the story and have some limitations like not being able to change ordinances. Personally, since I booted up the game first, I can experience everything, but I can understand why people would not like it because of this aspect. If you want to share a Switch, it is probably the best to avoid this title. If you mostly play alone or everyone has their own Switch or the people who want to share a console don't care on the story or the resident rep features and is willing to share the single player experience, consider picking this up."
Lil_Caucasian,"Jan 29, 2022",7,"This is a solid Animal Crossing game, but it lacks a lot of content the others had. By the time the updates came out I had fallen off of it, wish the content was there at launch."
GenkiYokota,"Jan 27, 2022",0,"Boring game with empty activities and heavy and boring progression.
Plus it doesn't allow you to create more than one island per console, which is a dirty tactic to force you to buy another one."
Ughduty,"Jan 25, 2022",6,"Don’t get me wrong the game is fun but has some issues you have to overcome.

Biggest issue = One island per Switch
Second biggest issue = Different Villagers having the same dialogue

Other than that the user interface is testing your patience. For example, if you have a stack of say 40 weeds and you would like to take 20 to sell them you have to separate one by one until you have 20 additional single weeds in your inventory and after that you have to put them together to a 20 piece stack. Letting you click at least 60 times to do that. There are plenty of other such instances. It is just Ridiculous!"
Uzannesay,"Jan 19, 2022",0,This game is awful. The primary resident is the only one who can do anything. All the secondary players are stuck doing the most mundane tasks until the primary player does certain stuff. I bought it for myself but let my young daughter start the game first. Now I’m stuck waiting for her to even find the inclination to complete tasks. Worst game I have ever played.
UrbanEelf,"Jan 18, 2022",9,The only reason I'm not giving a 10 is because this game is not durable as they promised.

Gregnator,"Dec 31, 2021",8,"As someone who never played any Animal Crossing games, Animal Crossing New Horizons is a very fun and light hearted game.
You get to see your island transform into a paradise.

I wish you could do more with multiplayer though.
The fact that you can only visit someone's island but not their version of Harvey's Island or any other place besides their island is disappointing. I wish I could go to random islands with online friends."
nowells5,"Dec 31, 2021",9,"Me apetecía ponerle un 10 solo por el hecho de que fue el juego que me mantuvo distraído y animado durante el primer confinamiento de la pandemia. Innovación respecto a títulos anteriores, mecánicas de farmeo y crafteo adictivas, un multijugador con mucho sentido, cientos de horas de entretenimiento... Lo tiene todo. La única razón por la que no le pongo un 10 es porque llega un punto (en mi caso a las 60 horas aproximadamente) en el que tienes la sensación que haces lo mismo todo el rato. Duración aproximada: la que cada uno quiera (puede durarte 20 horas o jugarlo por siempre)"
Watson0l0,"Dec 23, 2021",8,"An incredible time killer. The graphics do not cause rejection, but some of the gameplay moments are rejected, in particular the problems with the creation of objects, what was the problem so that you could create objects several at a time or use the main storage location as a buffer?"
MutedGoose,"Dec 22, 2021",2,"First I would like to say this was my first animal crossing game and that i didn't have a problem with having one island per switch, but i defiantly understand that for some people it can be frustrating. Therefore this review will strictly be about how i found the actual game and its fun factor.

For my first animal crossing game i was excited, I understood what kind of game it was and I was intrigued. So I got it and for the first few days i was really enjoying myself, activities like fishing and designing my house was really fun. But thats really it over the next week or two i started to realise everyday i losing motivation to do any of these tasks and that's because they are very boring and tedious. Tedium was mainly what drew me away from the game, everything is just so slow for some reason. Crafting, digging, collecting weeds etc. all take so much time to do making whatever payout that you are getting diminish. I felt I was doing these tasks for no reason but to grow my village and have to deal with more of these issues. I had a dream of making a perfect island filled with cool characters as that was how the game was marketed, but progression is so slow; taking days to build houses, bridges and inclines meaning that dream of mine was hundreds of hours away. Why would a game make something so interesting so inaccessible for a majority of gamers.

Im a huge fan of Nintendo, but this game was boring but even when i had something to do it was bland, tedious and more of the stuff i had been doing for the past three weeks. Not to mention I never felt satisfied with the payoff for hours of work. Maybe coming from a similar game like Minecraft really impacted my thoughts on the game."
ShamaloOoOoW,"Dec 22, 2021",10,"A real discovery for me who had never played the license, at the beginning I told myself that it was only for children because of the small animals in the game. But in reality I see in this game a very good potential  for future sequel, a construction game not quite complete but which is very reminiscent of or at least gently brings sims closer, especially in version 2.0.  I am personally convinced…"
GearDestruction,"Dec 11, 2021",7,"my main issue with this game is compared to the older version, the characters are too nice, they are extremely nice. and that makes feel the game less enjoyable compared to the older version when you're looking to have a social interaction with the villagers of your island.  the game lacks of realism and the feeling of making friends because you don't see a harsh version of your villagers when their personalities are cranky and snooty who were made to be rude or harsh in the early friendship.

I think they need to make the villagers more natural in the next game, because at the end of the day, the villager is what makes this game so enjoyable and without that sense of realism, it makes the game feels a bit less fun."
nodavan,"Dec 7, 2021",9,"I would say it's a go-to game for NS. The game play is simple. If you like collecting things and crafting DIY stuffs, this game is really made for you. There are also holiday and seasonal items too!"
MoewCP,"Nov 28, 2021",7,"It’s still an animal crossing game so I enjoy it. However, so much content was missing from the past games. Many characters being absent besides in the roost is sad and Tortimers role in harvs island was just to give him a role as it is unfortunately a pointless role. Adding cooking is cool but I still think the game would’ve been way better online with actual games and stuff to do like tortimers island. I personally don’t like the direction of more customization and would like it to be like you are just a villager. Missing features like tortimers island and it’s contents as well as small things like seeing the size of a fish or bug really hurts the games rating. The last main issue is villagers being to nice or soft. The GCN game was way to mean but now they feel to soft and lacking personality. Overall it needed more content."
Psychedaddy,"Nov 25, 2021",0,Parents. Do NOT buy this game. It’s a scam to get you to buy more than one Switch. It creates non-stop fights between siblings trying to play on their own profiles and is not worth the headache.
PizzaW0lf,"Nov 22, 2021",10,"Animal Crossing is one of my favourite series from Nintendo. That said, this game is great and came out during the perfect time. I have had great times with this game and it actually helped me reconnect with some old friends. I will admit, the game was a little bare at launch but after the big update, it's my favourite AC game and easily in my top 3 games of all time."
ochjago,"Nov 22, 2021",6,"Good, totally enjoyable game. But for how long? I don't play that kind of games very often, so don't exactly know what could have been done better, but the game is kind of boring after a while. Sure, first weeks are exciting and all, but then there's no reason to play, maybe except for some seasonal events."
KamaiJR,"Nov 22, 2021",9,"Game make me have a time to live in Island,relax game Build home have friend"
stibba,"Nov 21, 2021",5,"Disappointing.

i've seen very polarising reviews here, on one hand you have game critics universally giving every game a 9/10 and never critiquing anything, not this game either. And on the other hand you have the barrage of user reviews slamming a 0/10 because of stuff unrelated to the game or not being able to have several islands per copy. Im gonna try to save gaming and actually review the game.

Animal crossing is in everyway except for graphical fidelity a step down from new leaf.
After the tutorial there is no real progression and it really shines a light on how little there is to do in the game. You can go grind ingredients for recipes you dont have, listen to the 4 possible repeating sentences your villagers can say, or catch bugs/fish. Why is talking to your villagers such a bore? talking to them brings up a submenu basically asking ""are you sure you want to listen to the repeated dialogue again?"". In new leaf, you could talk to villagers for a long time before they started repeating themselves, i really dont know why it is so limited here, since its such a crucial aspect of the game.

With these main gripes clear, i would like to say that the game isnt all bad, designing your island and home is fun. Fishing is also fun, filling up your museum is the replacement for any progression the game otherwise lacks.

Overall this is a clear downgrade and the praise the game has gotten (perhaps because of release timing and new players) is not promising. I would recommend new leaf over this every day of the week, and you'll save 30 euro!

What a shame."
Za_Uvek,"Nov 21, 2021",8,"If you have picked up an Animal Crossing game then you should know what to expect. That being said, New Horizons sure is the next stage of Animal Crossing evolution.

Sounds and graphics are what they are, cute and colourful. As basic as it is, the overall atmosphere created by the aesthetics makes for a relaxing experience. And it needs to be relaxing as the game-play is the same as it has been in the past (with a few more features thrown in). You will spend the whole time grinding away to upgrade your house and your little island, all the while customising everything to your taste. Nothing more to say really, there is plenty of content and it's all what you make of it.

I must say, it might not have the depth or adventure of games like **** Valley, but it sure is satisfying. It was a joy to revisit my island day after day just to watch it grow! If you're after a warm and cuddly life simulator, you can't go wrong really."
Who-Dey_KY,"Nov 20, 2021",10,"I've put 1000 hours on this game. The update and DLC added a TON of new content. Tis a shame that this got review bombed by people upset that you only get 1 island per console. I kinda like that, as it makes you stick with YOUR island and makes you think more about the design choices you make. This is (I think) the best selling game of the last 5 years for a reason."
Neko_-Tiger,"Nov 17, 2021",10,If you a Long time fan then this is by far a no brainer.

AVOID Time Travel  it will shorten your enjoyment.
JoeyPL5,"Nov 16, 2021",10,"This game makes you feel like what you're doing in the game actually matters, and when you sit back and think about whether what you're doing actually matters, you realize the game shouldn't be fun. Then you play for 5 more minutes and you feel like it matters again."

ampz55,"Nov 4, 2021",0,"I bought the game for me and my 6 year old daughter to play separately, occasionally together with co-op. One save file per game is not ideal whatsoever. A 6 year old playing a game like this can be chaotic, to put it lightly. Not being able to have my OWN personal experience in this game is a gigantic downfall.

It's very obvious that nintendo wants to sell more consoles. I'm not giving them my money and I suppose I'm also not playing animal crossing anymore either.

Thanks for the royal **** up Nintendo."

JstAnthrGmr,"Oct 19, 2021",2,"I love the animal crossing franchise don’t get me wrong.. but this game just has so many disappointments I had to say something. It has been over a year and they are JUST NOW adding characters to the game that we have had in almost every other game in the series so far from the beginning. Also with all the updates, and knowing what people are most upset about they have not fixed the issue of one island per switch. It is unrealistic to expect everyone in the household will have their own switch just for this game. It was more reasonable to think that with the 3DS and even then multiple cartrigas got you multiple islands. On the GameCube multiple memory cards meant multiple saves. On the switch it’s one island per switch and everyone who uses that CONSOLE (as much as they want it to also be a handheld, it’s a console) has to live on the same island and only the person who starts the file actually gets any real say in how the island progresses. That makes it so that no one else really gets to enjoy the full game. If you have multiple family members sharing a switch that want to play the full game prepare to be disappointed. This fix would not be hard but they chose to ignore the issue in the hopes maybe people will buy more consoles? The new update coming is so large they definitely could have made this part of it and they didn’t. Now that they finally “finished” the game they released too early over a year later they are starting to release paid dlc? Not surprised they are mostly concerned with money and not their actual fan base."
lowey,"Oct 12, 2021",10,"There are few games that I have sunk more hours into than Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It **** you in and compells you to return day after day. It's a solid game, as you would expect, from Nintendo. There is a wealth of things to do each day, although earlier in the game it limits you a little — probably to stop it **** away your entire life — and once you've completed the main story arc there is still plenty to do. As the game progresses the story falls away and it becomes more and more like a sandbox game.

It's not perfect, of course: dialogues are lengthy and often add nothing, and the control mechanism for tools can be infuriating at times (""no don't dig that up,"" ""put that fence back,"" ""I didn't want to talk to them!"") And as many haters have already stated endlessly, you'll really have to have one console per player in the house since all players on a console share the same island. But in spite of its flaws it's a game that makes me feel good. I will open the game in the morning to check one or two things and then, before I know it, I realise I'm an hour late for work. The online community really makes this game too. Visiting others' islands via online multiplayer is great fun and can help new players get ahead quickly, and it's amazing just how much content (characters, items, recipes, fossils, artworks, bugs, fish, characters' dialogue, etc) they've squeezed in. Well worth the cost when I look at how many hours of ejnoyment I've received from this little gem ****."
Lordbread,"Oct 2, 2021",8,Really good game but you do have to put a lot of time in if you want to progress your island as much as possible. If you’re not worried about completely beating the game it is good just to spend 20 minutes or so on it and just walk around your island.
chrischaos,"Sep 27, 2021",7,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is just as addictive as ever. The visuals are improved and the core gameplay is engaging if you're looking for a relaxing experience. However, the game isn't without some major flaws.

I'm not a big fan of the loading times to get into the game.  You sit through a load to get to the title screen, then another to be greeted by Isabelle, followed by another load screen to finally start playing the game. It's unacceptable that it takes longer to load into ACNH than it takes to load into a massive game like Breath of the Wild.

Also, there's the big issue of ""One island per console"".  This would've been made a little better if it were possible to change the ""main player"" after starting an island. I wonder how many people started with one primary player who no longer has any interest in playing. Now you're faced with the choice of continuing with your limited experience or starting over and losing everything.

This game could be the best game on Switch, but it's plagued by some serious issues that brings the game down for me."
WPB,"Sep 23, 2021",10,"Mentally scaring, could not beat the Tom nook boss fight, way too stressful and difficult, forget mario party, this is the new hardest game of all time"
jeatog,"Sep 21, 2021",8,"PROS:
- Tiene una introducción maravillosa.
- Es tremendamente inmersivo y sus personajes te hacen tener ""sentimientos"" rápidamente.
- Sus mecánicas nuevas respecto a entregas anteriores hacen que sea tan diferente pero a la vez sin perder la esencia de lo que es.
- Soundtrack exquisito.
- Es adictivo jugablemente.

CONTRAS:
- Llega un momento en donde no hayas más qué hacer, lo cuál es crítico para este tipo de videojuegos.
- No hay una vasta variedad de diálogos de los vecinos; hay solo 10 tipos de diálogos según su personalidad, pero muchísimos más de ellos, lo cual causa que solo cambien en apariencia.
- Pantallas de carga y tutoriales excesivamente molestos al momento de jugar en línea.
- Falta de minijuegos.
- Para lo que significa el género, puede que por momentos lo relajante se vuelva aburrido.

El más reciente título de la saga Animal Crossing cubre muchas carencias que tenían anteriormente, pero al mismo tiempo le quita personalidad y se vuelve muy monótono a las horas antes de ""acabar"" el juego. También añade contenido invasivo que fácilmente podría no estar, pero eso no quita que sea un juego de calidad, bien hecho y con contenido suficiente, hasta cierto punto. New Horizons es un boleto de entrada a la saga y sirve de base para la consola de Nintendo, pues cualquiera que cuente con una debería tenerlo."
CryingMachine,"Sep 21, 2021",3,"UPDATED REVIEW:
Animal Crossing WAS a great game, we were promised so much and the initial release was great since there was so much to explore and everything was new.
Sadly that initial state of the game stayed...even until today. AC:NH has not gotten any major update for a long long time. Even the major updates that happened last year wore off already.

Nintendo really promised us 3 (or so) years of updates, sadly what they meant is 3 years of the same god-damn events every time. Gets quite sickening.

The villagers are also getting tiring, same dialogue, same robotic interactions. Not fun anymore.

I've spent 100hrs in this game and that's it to be honest, the game is stale and not fun anymore.
Everything just feels really old and boring and there's nothing new to do.

This is part of a bigger problem of Nintendo, over the years they started slacking more and more. Yes they do release amazing games every now and then (Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild) but a lot of their releases feel very ""clean"" with no life in them.

OLD REVIEW 9/10 (Jun 28, 2020) :
This game is amazing.

Animal Crossing is a game in which you can just sit back and relax to. A perfect game to escape reality with. The control is in your hands as you land on a deserted island with nothing but tents, you can build a thriving community. I love it!

With each new day you get access to new components of the game, yeah some might call it an unnecessary hindrance but this allows for a fresh dose of content each new day. Animal Crossing isn't about completing EVERYTHING in a day or two. You really do have to invest a lot of time and the game rewards you for doing so. Yeah not for everyone but for those who love games such as **** Valley this game is perfect.

The villagers (or I suppose Islanders) are very charismatic and make the island that much more fun. Yeah not all of them are great but there are just so many villagers that you can easily pick out your favourites and invite them to your island.

I love this game, I really do but I am also not a fan of the idea of singular saves per console. It really annoys me, I personally don't share my switch with my family as they don't care for Nintendo games but this is really spoiling the fun for others, also there is currently no CLOUD SAVING even though Nintendo brags about having that option for the NSO Subscribers. I hope Nintendo gets a grip and address this issue in the next update(s). Other than that I honestly have not major complaints."
Bisharps,"Sep 13, 2021",6,"Definitely the weakest in the series after City Folk.
Many missing features and the new features are a betrayal to the identity of the franchise.
It used to be about moving into a new neighborhood and slowly becoming one of the locals. Now it's just about having your personal island dollhouse.

It makes me worried about the future of the franchise because removing these new features in future titles will make it look reductive but keeping them in will cause the franchise to stagnate. The future is grim."
Kafod,"Sep 12, 2021",3,"The game is unfinished and there's only one island per Nintendo Switch. Not only that, but the dialogue is really repetitive. I do not recommend getting this game."
Kobaru,"Sep 2, 2021",5,"They just killed my villagers and special npc's and they let some of them sneak into the game with a threat minimum because they are so terrified that they don't even retain their respective personalities...

Jokes aside, the game is unfinished almost a year and a half after launch and there is nothing to do in it.
The hope that they change it is still there but ... It has two newscasts left."
IAmGood-U,"Aug 30, 2021",6,One Island per switch. What the actual? So stupid and scummy. The game itself is ok. Lots of items and ways to shape and decorate your island to make it like home. A few small changes and this game could be a lot better.
koyukon,"Aug 29, 2021",5,It’s just ok. I feel the holidays are worse in this than previous games. The base model of the game had huge potential but they missed the mark on content. They need to innovate. It hurt when my friends gave up on it within a year and I gave up in just over. I didn't like how unattainable and unnecessary some of the achievements were. Seems they set the bar high for tedious things because there is so little to do in other aspects of the game. Very much satisfied and also disappointed; this might be the end of my interest in this series.
rmw408,"Aug 28, 2021",8,Hours of fun creating your own island paradise. Set it up the way you want and change anytime. Ultimate control. A great way to waste several hours.
Lazg12,"Aug 27, 2021",4,"I got Animal Crossing New Horizons in March.
First it was really interesting and I played almost the whole day, but when I was finished with the main part ( having all the villagers, having all shops/ houses and being happy with how my island turned out) it got boring very quickly. I didn't play for weeks now because I have nothing to do. I have to say that Animal Crossing New Leaf was much better except for the graphics. The villagers were fun and you could to talk to them without them telling u the same few phrases over and over again like in New Horizons. Also it had much more shops and locations like the island with its mini games, the hairdresser and many more. In conclusion I think New Horizons is a fun game but compared to New Leaf it's being left on track.
Also it's bothering me, why couldn't nintendo just take New Leaf upgrade it a little bit and leave it there, bet that would've been outsold too in no time..."
metasupra2344,"Aug 22, 2021",4,"This is a fun, relaxing game. The crafting mechanic is fun for a little bit. It gets tiresome crafting the same thing while spamming the A button (especially to make fish bait). I wish that they had a craft all button or something like that. The main reason for this low score is because of the ""one island per console"" move that Nintendo pulled when they released this game. It's such a scummy move. They also had a bunch of features cut that were present in New Leaf cut only to bring them back in a later update. This was also perhaps the first time Redd wasn't in the base game at launch. Also the tool breaking function is really annoying especially when you're in ""the late game."" There really isn't a benefit to getting golden tools like in the previous games. The golden tools break in this game which kind of feels like a slap in the face especially for the amount of work you need to do to get the golden tools.

Overall this game is really fun and I enjoyed it. Annoyances aside, Nintendo's scummy implementation of game mechanics brought the rating down from a 8 to 10 to a 4."
Bloxed,"Aug 16, 2021",0,"The game suffers from being a sequel to New Leaf and also trying to be a Minecraft alternative.

New Leaf was an amazing game, one of my favourites of all time. My first year of playing, I managed to sink in over 500 hours. The game added so much, improved upon so much, it was one of my favourite video games of all time!

Then imagine my excitement when it was revealed a new Animal Crossing was coming to Switch. I was over-joyed! I was thinking about all the new possibilities, the new features, how it expands off of New Leaf! The trailer came in for February 2020, and then my hype was slightly narrowed down when they revealed Crafting... I was concerned at the time, however soon my concern would turn into a nightmare when I got the game on March 20th. I put the game in my Switch and was having a blast, however instead of what happened with New Leaf, where the game lasted me over half a year before I felt the need to take an extended break, it only took me just over a month to think that New Horizons should have been avoided. My Nightmares became true. The crafting was almost everything the game centred around, and it wasn't fun. Many objectives I was given, wether for Nook Miles or because of some Tom Nook stuff early on in the game, felt tedious rather than fun, like I didn't actually want to get these and look for these, but instead I felt an obligation to so then I could complete the game.

Then when I eventually got far in the game, I begun waiting for updates, because there were numerous issues the game faced. No Roost, No Shampoodle, No Re-Tail, no Shops besides Nook's Cranny and Able Sisters. The game was empty in features, and I sat down in my seat during every Direct, every trailer, hoping for a new building to be revealed. The realisation came in around Autumn, these were never going to come. The game was doomed to be a dissappointment.

The game was the first dissappointing Animal Crossing experience for me. I first started with City Folk / Let's Go To The City, and I loved it to death! Then I played Wild World for a short bit. Despite being a downgrade from the first game even, I still thoroughly enjoyed it for a more laid-back feeling, like you don't have to worry about coming on time for events as much, and you could go at your own pace, and it would still be fun. Then I played New Leaf, and like I said, one of my favourite games of all time, with City Folk / Let's Go To The City not far behind. Then I played the First game a few months after getting New Leaf, loved the game to death as well. Notice how all of the prior games to New Horizons, I loved playing like they were the only games I had in my collection. Hell, I even enjoyed Happy Home Designer and Amiibo Festival, and have started 2 towns for every game in the series, except for one... New Horizons...

New Horizons wasn't fun, and generally it was a mediocre - bad experience. It lacked the soul and features of other game, so you might as well buy those ones and their respective consoles instead, even if it costs more, it's still more worthy of the £50 - $60 price tag slapped on this, at best £20 - $25 experience.

One issue I would like to discuss quickly which can really show Nintendo's True Intent was that you could only have 1 island per Switch! So if you shared a Switch with family members, good luck trying to have your own independant experience!"
TempoTheMan,"Aug 12, 2021",5,"if you dont like to wait for things and do almost the same things every single day dont buy this, it has infinite playability but its just to boring for my taste,  I like quiet games sometimes but this game doesn't even have a normal story, altho thats nintendo :/"
BurtKocain,"Aug 6, 2021",8,"Few games, if any, have so serendipitously been released in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. For many, Animal Crossing: New Horizons provided the perfect conduit of escapism from the uncertainty and constant change in norms that came with the COVID-19 pandemic. And it doesn't hurt that, beyond the creature comforts and good vibes, there's a genuine case to be made for New Horizons as the best Animal Crossing ever. For the type of player who is extremely focused on curation, New Horizons offers the most customizable experience to date. And yet the more time you spend engaging with everything its world has to offer, the more likely it is for a profound sense of frustration and hollowness to set in. Many improvements to the series formula feel incremental rather than revolutionary, and there's a certain clunkiness to many design elements that you might expect a series to have ironed out by its fifth main installment. Worth noting is that despite numerous updates over the last year, the game still isn't nearly as rich in features or activities as its predecessor on the Nintendo 3DS. These are largely moot points, however, because the game delivers where it counts for many: As a fever-dream of cozy fantasy, and a brief antidote to increasingly uncertain times."
MePesto,"Aug 6, 2021",3,"An extremely lacking game in which I could barely give a 3. The music's boring. The graphics are very plastic-like. The dialogue is repetitive. There are few tasks, and this game could get put on the shelf within a few days. It's tedious to work with. It's bland and I've gotten some bored of this game, that I have sold the game back to the store. Not even two weeks in. I can't believe I even bought this game. Why is it $60? It's worth about $5 to me. I might try Animal Crossing: New Leaf, but for now, I need to rant."
Biyac,"Aug 6, 2021",0,This game stinks! I want a refund right now! This game is unfinished and lacking. I haven't even played this game since April 2020. This game is such a disappointment.
Boosher,"Aug 4, 2021",8,"When I first got my hands on animal Crossing new horizons I spent almost every awake minute on it.. Building my village from scratch it was very enjoyable and I found myself spending way too much time on it.

However I actually stopped playing the game after the Holloween patch I felt it was starting to get very bland and very boring real fast yes.. this could be because I did play the crap out of it but it was the similar situation on the Nintendo 3DS where I found myself playing for long period of time and then just figuring out that is quite boring and that’s coming from a guy who spent 200 hours+ on the game.

All in all Animal crossing new horizons is a great game to start off your Nintendo journey however play for as long as you like you don’t necessarily need to pay for the rest of your life but I do recommend you play it up to a certain point. A point where you’re happy with your village and everything is going smoothly. To which then you can probably move on to another game. The reason why I didn’t give it 10 out of 10 is.. I feel like Nintendo has started to throw in elements which aren’t really related to the animal Crossing franchise they just do it for the fan base or an excuse to hype gamers into playing it again.

I might or might not find myself playing it in the future that’s disappointing because I love animal Crossing. Also it has become even more bland as people have started to cheat and started selling Animal crossing items, money, tickets etc on the Internet which ultimately made the game even more dull as obtaining items have become meh."
ft5777,"Aug 3, 2021",9,"When the game released in March 2020 I played 30 hours in the first two weeks. I liked it well enough but I wasn't really hooked and I eventually stopped playing it. Until July 2021 that is, when I decided to boot it again and now I'm totally hooked. I put in the effort to unlock terraforming and then the game becomes a brand new game. I initially decided to spread villagers houses all over the island, but now I'm in the process of reshaping my entire island, with a residential area, a town business district, flowery parks with a little lake, a big camping lake, a forest full of waterfalls, and I also placed my house far away from the town in the hills and I want to make it bigger and better furnished. Basically, once you find the motivation to make a great and beautiful island to your tastes, you become hooked and it's a very soothing game. It draws you in like no other game did for me.

Of course, the game is not perfect. I wish Nintendo would bring some much needed quality of life improvements, such as bulk crafting, bulk buying, being able to craft in your house with items stored in your house and not only those stored in your pockets. Also, skipping already seen dialogues. It's currently a game of patience to suffer through Blathers' interminable blabber when you just want to identify and donate a fossil. And that, every time ! I wonder if this is done by design or if Nintendo just doesn't bother making player's lives easier. Bottom line, it is annoying that Nintendo doesn't address those problems, but they don't prevent the enjoyment of the game, far from it.

I'm not playing online so I can't comment on online issues. Also, concerning the one island per console thing, let me just say that I absolutely don't approve of Nintendo's decision to allow only one island per console instead of one island per profile. This seems totally arbitrary and anti-consumer. I am personally not concerned by this and I enjoy the game immensely, I think it is deserving of a 9/10. But I can understand the frustration of people sharing a Switch and wanting to both play the game."
juanandesign,"Aug 2, 2021",10,"Honestly, most of the haters and complainers of the game is people who had played more than 500 hours in less than a year, begging form more content in a 50$ with no DLCs game. It´s absurd. The game gives you a crazy amount of content and hours of fun. Relax and enjoy it, and remember, it is just a game!"
zucchan,"Aug 2, 2021",8,"A very fun and relaxing game, suitable for all ages! I particularly liked the different festivals that periodically take place on the island"
Bones123,"Jul 31, 2021",8,"I love acnh (animal crossing new horizons) it looks great but after 4 months and no time traveling it gets a little boring still play it every day!.

The story to get k.k. (a dog who sings) on my island was fun and making my dream island is fun too.

If that add new stuff then it would be a 10 or 9!"
TopARof,"Jul 22, 2021",0,"Why is there crafting in an Animal Crossing game? This isn't a Minecraft-style game! STOP STEALING FROM MINECRAFT NINTENDO! There are corporations now that are even more selfish than EA, including you Nintendo. This is the worst game ever made, and Nintendo should be embarrassed of themselves. It makes no difference to me whether it gets a Metacritic score of 90! That's a lie! Nintendo most likely paid them to choose only the positive reviews and one mixed review for the game. THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING REASONABLE! Customers complain about most games in a variety of ways, and the way Metacritic does that is unrealistic and does not make sense. Metacritic, please do your research! This game will always, and forever be a 0/10."

They only picked the good reviews and probably got paid by Nintendo to choose only the game one, and one mixed review. THAT IS NOT REALISTIC! Most games get several mixed reviews, and sometimes negative reviews. METACRITIC, DO YOUR RESEARCH! This game will forever be a 0/10."
Medelat,"Jul 19, 2021",5,"I'll admit. I was gonna give it a 6, but I just couldn't find enough good in it to be a 6. 5 is where it's at. But anyways, this type of game. The waste of time, no-good, stupid, half-baked game is enough to describe the entirety of this. Firstly, the graphics are good, I'll admit. For a Nintendo game, this isn't half-bad. The designs are nice too, with some nice scenery and stuff. The music is horrible though, and does not fit this game. There are three woods to describe this game. Boring, repetitive, and tedious. The long, repetitive, dialogue is tedious, the music is bland and sounds boring, and the whole game, in general, is indeed, boring. I've give it one thing though. It's visually stunning. You can walk and run with no lag, and browse around. The items also look pretty good, and the bugs and fish look stunning in the museum (once you build it). Considering how I got this on sale though, I can't give it a negative rating. I got it for $30, instead of $60, but if I did get it for $60, I would give it a 3 or 4. At least the museum is visually stunning, and looks nice. At least there's not a lot of lag. The controls are basic. Whatever. I can't think of anything more to say, so I'll leave it here. Overall, it's a 5/10. Pretty mediocre and bland, but does have some stunning graphics, and the museum is kind of cool. But the music is horrible, the dialogue is long and repetitive, and the game is boring."
maestrooak,"Jul 17, 2021",9,"A solid entry in the animal crossing franchise, but do we really need crafting?"
danlol483,"Jul 17, 2021",9,"Es un genial juego que todos deberían probar, aprovechando que este juego a revivido la saga. No todo es positivo debido a que faltan cosas de otros juegos de la saga (peluquería, observatorio de estrellas...)
Si quieres empezar jugando a la saga Animal Crossing recomiendo este"
giannis2001,"Jul 15, 2021",9,"I am shocked this game has 5 user score. I don't understand the reason. This game is the ideal sandbox life simulator. I haven't played an Animal Crossing game before but this one got me really into it. The idea of turning a deserted island into a fully equipped with everything town, just makes it even more interesting. And of course, there are TONS of things to do. There are some small things that are annoying though, like time consuming animations each time you do something etc but you get used to it. I fully recommend it, especially for fans of this genre."
gabsprado,"Jul 8, 2021",2,"The game is pretty mediocre, the graphics looks astoundingly beautiful and minimalistic, but that's pretty much it. Content-wise it has less content than indie games like **** Valley that costs six times less and it's miles better. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is severely lacking if compared to the previous ones, a lot of NPCs and shops were cut out, the villagers interactions are pretty dull and becomes repetitive pretty fast, the numbers of buildings went from 13 (New Leaf) to a baffling 4 in New Horizons. Also they got out with some pretty nasty and scammy decisions that tainted the experience for me like for example:

-One island per console. If you want to create another island, buying another copy of the game isn't enough, you'd literally have to buy another $300 console

-The game released pretty unfinished, and they got out with it by saying they would implement free updates. Well, one year later and those updates proved to be VERY underwhelming and repetitive (literally every holiday event is: collect this item on the map, trade it for furniture, repeat). And even after one whole year the game is still severely lacking compared to previous ones or the microtransaction one (Pocket Camp)

-Some RNGs in the game are pretty much broken, my art museum is still pretty much empty because the Redd boat was programmed to almost never show up in the Island, so unless you're willing to time travel (which shouldn't even be a feature) you'll probably never gonna complete your museum collection.

-After, like, two weeks playing the game you'll probably =burn out everything the game has to offer and the only thing left for you to do is to check the holiday events that, again, is pretty much the same thing with a new skin.

-The mini-games, common in every Animal Crossing entry, are non-existent in this one.

-Brewster, Tortimer and Kapp'n aren't in the game and probably won't be added

-The gyroids, also common in every entry, are also non-existent in this one

-The game is probably abandoned by Nintendo at this point and won't have updates anymore."
BronzeBoy,"Jul 7, 2021",10,"Even if people find the game boring because of the lack of updates, I still find it interesting because creativity is a strong factor for me that keeps me coming back. I could go on forever and ever about this game, but long story short, this game deserved it's 10/10 rating from me."
glitchboi,"Jul 6, 2021",7,"EDIT 7/6/21: Yeah... that didn't age quite well.
The only issue with this game in my opinion, is the fact that the updates are...
You know, I would have been happy if they delayed the game in order to get the entire game packed into the base game. All we got is a game that is fun at the start, but gets boring because it's early-access.
That's about it. Pick it up if you love Animal Crossing, but New Leaf is superior in every way (excluding graphics).
Old review: This game is a masterpiece. It's a game you should ALWAYS buy for your switch no matter what. You can never get bored of it, and you can get so much hours off of it easily. There is so much to do in the game, and there is always something to do in it. You can customize the look of your character, your island, your house, and you can get villagers! This is, without a doubt, one of the best Nintendo Switch games.
So, you may be asking, why does this game have a 7.0 user review, and why so much hate? Simple, immature review bombers putting 0 on the damn game because of one **** con about it. Don't be surprised, they're just mad because they didn't do research, wait, didn't Nintendo tell us about it, and wasn't it like this for the past AC games? I respect disliking that dumb feature, but don't give this game a 0 just because of that, actually try playing it for a while first."
PanaSonci6,"Jul 3, 2021",7,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a simulation type of game where you can make stuff, pay debt and be friends with animals! It's a fun concept, and it was well executed here! But, it did lack allot of what made Animal Crossing... Well, Animal Crossing. The crafting mechanic is cool, but, It's very annoying when your tool breaks, you have to rebuilt it all over again with the materials. It also lacks allot of the charm New Leaf had in my opinion. New Leaf had cool bonus items like a Wii U and even Nintendo game themed items! Animal Crossing: New Horizons lacks allot of that. But, don't get me wrong, It's a blast making your island look cool with furniture, visiting other's island and even playing with friends once in awhile is great! I would recommend it to almost everyone, since they updated the game to have more to it, but, It didn't grab me back as much as New Leaf did."
lucy_crossing,"Jul 1, 2021",1,"The good:

1. Improved visuals and atmosphere
2. QoL improvements
3. Prologue phase is a really good introduction to the series

The bad:

1. Base game is very shallow
2. Life-sim aspects are butchered
3. Villagers feel like decorations
4. Series staples beloved by the fanbase missing
5. Updates are spaced out, leaving players frustrated with long content droughts
6. Updates are also lacking in substantial content that will give players a reason to continue playing

After more than a year, the game is still pretty much the same experience at launch. Very weak entry in the series, which is entirely focused on decorating and designing the island, leaving the core life-sim aspects of the series abandoned for seemingly no reason."
Cevic,"Jul 1, 2021",0,"This shouldn’t be called New Horizons since there’s nothing good in this game. I don’t believe it. What is this garbage? It’s a time-waster, in a bad way. You get bored quickly. There’s only three songs in this game. THREE SONGS! The title theme, the outside theme, and the shopping tent theme. WHAT IS THIS? You get two villagers and they don’t help you with progress. I quit this game. I wanted to throw my controller into the TV and destroy the island! Luckily I got a refund, but it was a hassle!"
KEGoku,"Jul 1, 2021",3,"It's not a 0, by any means, but overall, WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS! It makes you wanna get out, out of this trap ****. It's not good. It has ruined last year, and this year. When we found out a New Animal Crossing game was coming out, we were excited. We each had humble hopes. Ever since that 2019 announcement, I was dreaming of an amazing town to play in. But, when the trailer for New Horizons came out, our hopes were not as high. We were debating whether to get the game. We all agreed that we didn't like the whole NookPhone thing, but we still had hopes. We were excited March, but slowly but surely, it became worse. When April came along, so did Bunny Day. UGH! That was STUPID and didn't make me want to play the game! I started getting bored around mid-April, slowly but surely decreasing my rating. May was alright, and then we realized how repetitive it was. My friend didn't appreciate the game as we wanted it to be. As the months went by, everyone, including me started to not like the game. It became a bad game. It became so repetitive, we couldn't even play a minute. It's a waste now. Some new features are alright, but I can't give this any more than a 3/10. It's not a 0, we kind of enjoyed the game at first. Even the updates couldn't save the game... The updates are horrible and repetitive. They don't fix the game, and never will. No matter how many updates they release, it will never fix the game. As a long time Animal Crossing fan, I am disappointed. Many long-time Animal Crossing fans are disappointed in this game. Even people who don't play Animal Crossing will eventually find New Horizons repetitive. Whatever the case, I suggest people do not get the game. You may find it alright for a few hours, but after that, prepare to be disappointed. If you want to be introduced to Animal Crossing, we suggest an older game, but not the spin-offs. I think this should represent the issues that people think of this game. Oh, and the hourly music. Oh my... it's bland. It does not represent Animal Crossing music, and feels extremely bland, especially in the first month. It makes you want to turn off the music entirely. That's another issue I forgot to mention. The music! I remember playing, and the music... is boring. Now I think that's everything to include in my opinions, along with my friends opinions. It's a disappointment."
FevacShand,"Jun 30, 2021",0,"I hate this game strongly, and I suggest people back away from this disgusting game."
snoopystallion,"Jun 26, 2021",2,"This game was suppose to be the savior of this pandemic. Nintendo said, they would update this game for years. but i cant see that happening. when it released, you weren't even able to swim. on an island setting.... so that they fixed that with an update was just a must. all events are just the same with different settings. the rewards are meaningless and don't serve anything of value. it is simply aweful that you have to get all the furniture with DIYs from balloons and villagers and so on. you get way too many duplicates. its absolutely not fun. beeing forced to go in online forums and look for someone who maybe has a needed DIY. the shops are absolutely small. they offer so little products. its annoying. you can craft in bulk its just annoying. many things of this game are just there to take ages. just like the terraforming. but the devs had to make it as annoying and time consuming as possible for every single chore. because the game has absolutely nothing to offer gameplay wise. you cant do anything with friends. no minigames. no nothing. you are forced to make your own imaginary games. i simply cant understand how this game has a perfect score from official media. this game is incredibly shallow. all villager say the same everyday. they don't have any character. they are not interesting at all. have nothing to say. the game lacks so many features, furniture, events and gameplay from past games. the game still haven't got an update 2.0. its been over a year now and they still didn't implement anything of value to the game. all they do is recycle events and bring some more seasonal items to the game. they basically don't update the game at all til now. for over a year since release. (because the last big thing was the ability to swim. and this was simply a must. and even that wasn't even a new thing -.-)

and one more annoying thing... they don't listen to the community at all. they ignore everything. so its just worse that they make twitter posts on a regular basis everytime they implement another meaningless item. or recycle an event again. they got their money and now they just don't give a damn about this game anymore or their fans. oh and the multiplayer is just the worst. there is absolutely nothing positive about it. but that was expected. Nintendo has no skill for online experiences. they screw up every single multiplayer ever.

to end this review on a more positive note... there are some good things. the graphic is pleasing and the soundtrack is great. good for chilling. the rest of the game is nothing but a dumpster fire.

tl;dr
pros:
- soundtrack
- graphics
- nostalgia

cons:
- gameplay
- NPC AI
- crafting
- gameplay
- all the time wasting gameplay mechanics
- all the small shops
- all the missing shops and villager from the past
- all the missing furniture from the past
- gameplay
- no minigames
- online multiplayer
- only one island per switch console
- the ticket islands are just boring and repeat way too often and look all the same
- items break way too quick with no indication
- gameplay
- building, placing and terraforming is very very imprecise and clunky
- all events are recycled and the rewards are bad.
- getting all the stuff from redd is just the worst. it can easily happen that you wont see him for month!!
- gameplay
- and basically everything else which makes games, games."
Gamer525,"Jun 25, 2021",1,"It's a good game with wasted potential, it was worthy of being the best animal crossing game, it had a lot of potential, like editing the Minecraft-style terrain, also in crafting things, like the minecraft crafting table, but just Nintendo and its developers, they did not know how to implement it well, the manufacturing is very bad, in capital letters! It is very tedious to find the iron, stone and clay, the terrain, it becomes very repetitive, after a few days pass, the developers did not know how to implement it well.

Music is just MEH

AC ACCF and ACNL, has great music, which made identifying the games in an excellent way, especially new leaf, it has the best music of the entire saga, examples are, 1am, 8am, 1pm and 5pm, you can feel it identified.

In New Horizons?

His music can be meh, bad, mediocre, I say that his music is very repetitive and bad, it does not fit the environment, which in this case is an island, for me, almost all of them are bad , with the exceptions of 12pm, 8pm, 3pm and 5pm, which do give a tropical atmosphere.

Its graphics are good, to be a 2020 game on switch, although in the animal neighbors, many do not convince me, they look a little plastic, cheer them up, but that is forgiven.

The mechanics are terrible!

In later installments, Nintendo was forgiven, that you could only generate a world, for 4 players, but in new horizons, that is no longer forgiven.

It's just ridiculous, like that one island? If the switch, being a more powerful console than the wii u, can support several maps, that is, do I have to pay another $ 400 for a switch and the game? it is no longer tolerable.

The animal neighbors, they became someone without personality or soul, in new leaf or later installments, your neighbors wanted to meet you, you could see their personality in them, they were like people or friends of yours, that you could do many things, such as invite them to your home .exchange things, play among others.

In new horizons, they just became puppets without personality, you can no longer do that, which later installments offered you, they are careless and you cannot talk to them so much, I limit myself a bit to that.

updates.

The updates, from 1.0.0 to 1.9.0, could be in the base game, it is an excuse, so that Nintendo can extend the life of the game, in my opinion, the updates themselves are bad, almost not brings nothing new, just a couple of sets and the events, which could be in the base game, as I repeat.

In conclusion, this game is not for that fan of ancient animal crossing, if you are looking for a delivery, that you simulate a life with animals and feel identified, because this game is not for you, play new leaf, city folk and that of game Cube.

but if you want to hang out, this game is for you.

JuicyApple724,"Jun 24, 2021",2,"I can't believe it... After digging nearly 400 hours into New Leaf on the 3DS, I was patiently awaiting the next iteration on Nintendo's newest console. I was just as excited as everybody else was when the game was first teased and then announced; getting hyped to yet again to be fully immersed in the island life.

It's too bad that this game was such a magnificient disappointment!

I started to play this as soon as I got it as an Easter gift, I started putting in many hours and... something wasn't clicking. Unlike New Leaf, where I would have sleepless nights waiting to enter my village for the next day, this game gave me no such feeling. I also played New Leaf consistently for about three years, yet this game became boring to me after about a month. So what gives?

Firstly, there are a few positive things to praise the game for (although mostly minor in the grand scheme of things). The graphics are gorgeous in the game, and the miniscule details added along with them like Villagers now doing activities is so fun to see! The Soundtrack, while it is inferior in comparison to the wonderful soundtrack of previous Animal Crossing games (Especially New Leaf), is still very nice to hear and I enjoy the songs.

With that out of the way, let's get into the many negative aspects. For starters, there's nothing to do! In New Leaf you could shop on Main Street, do errands and play minigames with villagers, visit the island with friends, go thrifting, enjoy tourneys and other special events, and plenty more! New Horizons is just... bare bones (which is quite applicable for the state of the game as a whole.). Special Characters and many shops have been gutted from the game. As you can see in some other reviews here, the developers also promised frequent updates to the game which would add in more content and even gave me and others the hope that many characters and shops would return... Nope! A year in and the updates have been incredibly lackluster, adding in nothing of note ( Well except for content that was ALREADY IN PREVIOUS GAMES). Holidays and Tourneys are God Awful in New Horizons. For example, in a New Leaf Fishing/Bug Tourney you would be competing with all the villagers in your town on catching the largest bug/fish. Whoever caught the largest by the end of the day would be placed in the top 3 and receive a trophy and maybe even special furniture for their achievements. In New Horizons the tourneys are... You against yourself? They instead opted for simply catching the most bugs/fish in an allotted time limit to get a prize. That takes away the fun and soul of a tourney. You would also think the events would be better but that is also a lie, some events are months long where all you do is the same stuff (cough cough wedding day). Speaking of soul being ripped out, let's talk about the villagers. It used to be fun and charming talking with your villagers everyday in New Leaf. You would slowly build up friendships by visiting each other's houses, completing errands, playing games, etc... In New Horizons this has all been sacrificed and Villagers have been made cute objects to look at instead of actual living villagers... The big gimmick of this game is the customization of your island with terraforming, decorating, and crafting being buffed or newly added features. Crafting becomes monotonous and grindy when you have to grind resources from your island day after day, making none of this new system fun for me at all. Animal Crossing should be a game where I can escape the stresses of life and relax, not have to grind for some stupid iron ore in a rock! Oh and by the way Nintendo, drip feeding through updates is not how you make previous Animal Crossing players want to come back to your game!

It pains me to say it but I really cannot recommend this game. Another reviewer here mentioned how this game is more like a ""Happy Home Deluxe"" where the game is great with decorating and customization, but forgot everything else that makes Animal Crossing Animal Crossing. If you want a true Animal Crossing experience, pick up a 3DS and play New Leaf, by far the better game. I entered this game thinking this could be one of Nintendo's greatest series, now I'm left shivering at the future of Animal Crossing Games."
Savelle,"Jun 24, 2021",2,"Disappointing compared to predecessors. Lack of content in advertised ""free updates"". Would not have bought if I knew the updates would be so lackluster."
alcremiebeanie,"Jun 24, 2021",0,New Horizons killed my love for this franchise. Animal Crossing is supposed to be a cozy life sim but NH really is nothing more than just a soulless decorating game.... save yourself the trouble and get New Leaf instead.
nahobino5_,"Jun 22, 2021",3,"After 500+ hours, I can confidently say that I know almost everything about the game and I have no more motivation to play it. Even without time travelling, it has become too easy to progress. You quickly run out of essential things to achieve. You can decorate outdoors now, which is great, but the variety in items is too limited. The game also very quickly starts dropping below 30 FPS if you decorate MODERATELY (not even talking about cluttering!) and if you're sensitive to that, it's horrible. Island building is an amazing new feature, but this seems to be at the cost of many other things. Way too little events, no more fun buildings like the coffee shop and not many special villagers as well. It's really missing that depth. You can now go on island trips to 'choose' your own villagers and they don't randomly leave anymore. That's great. Other than that, their personality and quirkiness in dialogue is ultimately gone. They pretty much say the same every two days. In the end, the game is a fun decorating simulator with lots of limits. It desperately needs a 2.0 upgrade with many new features and items.
Another big minus: Every island has a fixed color palette on all items that come in different colors. Instead of collecting color-changing items, you are now forced to buy Nintendo Switch online and trade. This is a big turnoff for me. Say, if you want a basic item like a white streetlamp, but your island only offers rusty red ones, you won't be able to get it unless you trade with someone else. I think this is a horrible feature and takes away the freedom of decorating. This applies to around 60-70% of all available items."
JLord701,"Jun 21, 2021",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons joins titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a system seller. This isn’t just a must-have title; it’s a reason to buy a Nintendo Switch.
I went into this game somewhat blind. I’d seen some of the trailers, but this was my first time playing and owning an Animal Crossing game. Additionally, the simulation genre just isn’t my cup of tea. The only other life simulator I’d dabbled in was **** Valley(another great game).
However, from the opening minutes, I knew this game would be special. It’s probably the most relaxing game I’ve ever played. After playing New Horizons and more recently, some excellent survival horror titles(Resident Evil 2 and 7), I’ve realized you don’t need fast paced action to make a game enjoyable. However, take that into consideration before purchasing/playing this game. It’s very slow paced and unfortunately,  there is some unnecessary tedium. It would go a long way if a feature was added to craft sets of an item instead of crafting them individually(Tip: spam the A-button while crafting to speed up the process). Tool durability is also an unnecessary annoyance. Weapons durability suits a game like Breath of the Wild much better. It lets you experiment with the sandbox and make full use of all your items. That isn’t the case in new horizons. Another minor gripe is playing with multiple accounts. You can only have one island per system. This wasn’t an issue for me since I’m the only one who plays my Switch, but it’s something to keep in mind if you have young children, friends, a spouse/partner, or anyone else who wants their own island.
Like I previously mentioned, this is an extremely slow paced game. Some Players used “time traveling” to speed up the game, but I don’t recommend that. I suggest you play how the developers intended.
With my (mostly)minor gripes out of the way, let’s talk positives. First of all, this game is absolutely gorgeous. It may not quite reach Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, or Mario Kart 8 levels of beauty, but I’d still put it in the top ten best looking games on the system. The art style is amazing, the lighting is top tier, and it ran at a solid 30 frames-per-second with no drops or stuttering from what I noticed. Sound design is as relaxing as it could be. The music is beautiful as well, although it might get on some players’ nerves during extended play sessions, especially before town hall is built.
In terms of strength in gameplay, I’ve never felt this much freedom in many other games. However, if I had to pinpoint my favorite aspect, it was probably collecting bugs, fossils,  fish, and other sea creatures, and donating them to the museum. It was always fun having friends visit my island and showing off all of the rare catches I’d obtained. This was one of the few games where I displayed audible excitement whenever I caught a whale shark, sunfish, or oarfish for the first time.
More than many other games, New Horizons displays progress in a visual sense, rather than experience points, cool weapons, or armor. Your island will start out messy and overgrown with weeds and unwanted trees, but as the game moves forward, you’ll unlock more villagers(and their respective houses), shops, and items to put on display. There are plenty of mindblowing islands on display on the internet, that even I(someone who played for more than 150 hours) couldn’t begin to think of. It truly is your experience, and everyone’s will be different.
If I had to point out one last gripe I had with the game, it would be updates. This review is being written almost 1 ½ years after launch, and although Nintendo has been consistently updating the game, it has lost a bit of longevity, but that’s only because I played so frequently at the beginning of the pandemic and I possibly could’ve been burnt out on it. You’ll get plenty of hours out of the game, it’s just after this many, there isn’t as much of a reason to pick the game back up.
Despite the minor issues I have with the game, I think this is a game anyone can enjoy. If you only like fast paced action, you should still give this one a try. I did, and I’ve loved nearly every minute."
dojarat,"Jun 16, 2021",4,"if i was writing this review a year ago this game would’ve been at a 9 or even 10 as i and a bunch of other fans were promised updates to the game that would add new features however a year later this game feels less like a 60$ game and more like an e3 demo, we’ve only gotten a handful of updates most of which were watered down features that were already in the base game of previous entries, lackluster “events” or random (tiny) furniture that no one has asked for we haven’t received a proper quality of life update or any major updates that added new or even old features except 2 both of which were last year meanwhile animal crossing pocket camp (a free mobile game) receives  updates way more frequently and almost each one includes exciting furniture sets, this game is an absolute let down from the high that was new leaf and it’s sad to see such a great series  produce such a boring  experience"
Nomine,"Jun 16, 2021",2,"I spent close to $400 to be able to play this game and I feel as though I and all other Animal Crossing fans have been scammed . After years of waiting , Animal Crossing fans were excited to hear there was a new mainline Animal Crossing game coming which promised amazing new features for decorating and truly customizing the  exterior of your town . It was a bit suspicious that they only showed the beginning of the game in the promotional material and didn’t showcase any of the rest of the things that are present in every other Animal Crossing game once you progress past the beginning . But , people figured there was a good explanation for this and , of course , expected that the game would include all the features that all the other mainline Animal Crossing games have because those things are what makes a mainline animal crossing game a mainline animal crossing game and differentiate them from the spin off games which are missing those features . However , once the game launched and people played it for a few weeks it became clear all those things were completely absent from New Horizons and that New Horizons only featured about 1/4 of the content of a normal Animal Crossing main title . When the game released , Nintendo promised to continuously update it for a few years and , in the beginning , they did do some fairly significant updates . This lead people to believe that the missing features in the game would come in the future but it is clear now , after a year of playing and seeing the updates get fewer and further between , that the game is never going to update to the point it can be considered the mainline Animal Crossing game that they claimed it was . The game itself is more like Animal Crossing Happy Island Designer than a mainline Animal Crossing Game . If you think of it as an Animal Crossing spin-off game for decorating an island then it is actually fairly fun , although , a bit unnecessarily tedious . If they had advertised it truthfully like that fans would have been happy with the game . But , the deceit of calling it a main line game , knowing it would mislead their customers into spending money , and then stringing them along for a year before revealing their trickery so there is no hope of fans getting their money back is , frankly , unforgivable . I would not have paid $60 for this game let alone the $400 I had to pay to buy the game , a Switch , and Nintendo Online to be able to play it properly . And that’s another thing , on top of having much fewer items than previous games ( despite essentially being a decorating simulator ) , you are required to pay for Nintendo online and trade with other players to be able to get half of the items . They want you to trade with your friends but no one has enough friends who want to spend hundreds of hours trading on animal crossing to be able to get every item they want ( especially since there is nothing to do for entertainment when you connect online with friends like there was in past games ) which forces them to go online and meet up with sketchy strangers who often try to scam them because there is no mechanic in game to be able to trade online safely . It’s clear this was just another tactic to get people to spend more money on the game without regard to making an enjoyable gaming experience . That seems to be the overarching theme of this game . They wanted to scam millions of fans into buying New Horizons with false promises of a mainline Animal Crossing game when the reality was an unfinished cash-grab , scam people into buying a Nintendo Online subscription to be able to fully play said game , and scam people into buying a Switch so that they will buy more games for it from them in the future . Well , in the future , unless they decide to make it right and actually update the game to being a proper Animal Crossing mainline game , I will never buy a Nintendo game at release again and I will buy all my Switch games used so that I do not support this company ."
Dave45Dave45Dav,"Jun 16, 2021",0,"Game abandoned, lack of content missing from previous games like npcs shop upgrades, 100s of iconic furniture items which make up themed sets gone, no mini games to enjoy with friends like Tortimer island, villagers are empty with poor range of dialogue you can't have them visit you absolutely nothing, breakable golden tools, I could go on and on.

It's basically a seasonal item collection sim"
arlenn,"Jun 15, 2021",1,"Well, the director of this entry is the director of Happy Home Designer. That is why game feels more like a HHD sequel than a new Animal Crossing entry.... I loved this franchise but they literally removed everything that made AC charming, for what?? For being able to terra-form and decorate my island? This game is supposed to be a life-simulator, not a decorating game :/ Big let down! Also they promised us 3 years of updates, the first updates were nice but then the updates turned into adding the festivals and 3 items... wow! If the current director will also be the director of the next game, I am going to say goodbye to this franchise."
TonberryKing198,"Jun 15, 2021",0,The game lacks over half of features from previous releases and passes infinitesimal updates as actual content update. Lackluster and disappointing. Play New Leaf for a propper Animal Crossing.

kanariya,"Jun 12, 2021",5,"Boring.
I thought this game was some what like a “slow Sims” But after I found out that in order to continue this game, I need to do laboring continuos things like fishing over and over…when I find out that there is nothing much story flowing which made me boring and stop playing this game."
IkOzael,"Jun 10, 2021",6,"As someone who's gotten into Animal Crossing through Pocket Camp among other things, I enjoy playin' this game way more (even though this series would be right at home on a phone now), but it has many flaws and lacks a ton of things.

For one, the villagers should have their own unique personality to set 'em apart from each other. They're a main part of this little series, yet there's nothing interesting about 'em other than appearance. Personality-wise, there's zero distinction between, say, Beau and Puck for example. In general, you give a villager a gift, they mindlessly accept it as the best thing ever. The only reason to ever get attached to a villager comes down to their looks, not really what they say and it makes 'em bland. They never show any emotion other than absolute happiness. It's feels like a utopia (which I ironically wanted to name my island at one point). Everything is supposedly so perfect and no one ever has anything to talk about other than positive vibes only. It feels so feels artificial. By the way... I don't think it would hurt to have romance. It is fictional and the villagers have anthropomorphic qualities.

Anyway, special characters aren't much better. The Able Sisters, specifically Sable, is the only one of the three with any kind of interesting dialog and that ain't sayin' a lot. Now that I think about it... STOP with the non-existent conversation trees. Everyone blasted the hell outta Pokémon Sword & Shield for the same thing (if you could even call it that), but of all games, Animal Crossing should be actually doing it. What's the point of choosing dialog when it either amounts to nothin' or has the same outcome as the other choice. Anyway, there's another thing that annoys me: the island sandbox. Why is it that every game uses this formulaic Minecraft-like ""world"" layout (actually, that would be insulting Minecraft's world generation since it's actually vast compared to Animal Crossing's hub world generation)? It'd be really nice if they designed an actual world instead of just ""Hey, there's this new thing happening right now. Here's your new home. Have a good life!"". Oh, and why don't villager homes expand? It'd be pretty cool if they also invited you to their homes for whatever reason. I could imagine Muffy inviting me to a sleepover or Beau and Puck wanting me to watch TV together.

Another reason I'm mixed on this game is that I wish there were more activities to do instead of the same fishin', bug catchin', shell collectin', fossil huntin', flower planting, and island designing that's been in every game. With all these props in the game, you'd think you could interact with more than a handful of 'em in a more interesting way. Y'know, something akin to those two 3DS minigames from New Leaf, but expand that to certain items. Maybe have villagers occasionally challenge you to a match? Also, I think the game should really move on from the overhead view. It'd be nice to see everything with a free camera. It's aesthetically dull when every building or object is or has to be oriented forward to work with the overhead view.

I almost never use local multiplayer since I do thing on my own in this game and people got me covered on why online is lame.

It's dumb how cloud saves weren't a thing from the start (even though the way it is still kinda ass). Is cheating really that big of a problem in a game where you create your own experience? Are you serious? It'd be one thing if somethin' like this was runnin' rampant online in multiplayer games, but come on. If people rather stick to the legit way of playin', that's their decision. If people rather put their time into moddin' the game to speed up the progress or whatever, that's their decision. Simple. Whether they regret it or not in the long run is on them. Or god forbit someone simply wanted to have fun changing stuff on their game, affecting no one in the process.

I like this franchise, but there's a LOT of room for improvement; I didn't talk about all the problems or thoughts I had on this game and the series as a whole. Maybe some of the game's issues will be patched. I'm not optimistic though. The day this series upgrades from being a budget version of The Sims is the day I can truly call it good"

Fireflyfox37,"May 23, 2021",0,"My husband and I decided to get it, because we both love animal crossing. Since my husband bought it, he started first. He's been playing it a few days, and I went to start my island when he wasn't playing. Guess what? I can't. You LITERALLY CANNOT HAVE TWO ISLANDS ON ONE SWITCH. Are you kidding? Just because my husband started the game, now I can never have my own without spending hundreds of dollars on another game console? That is absolutely ridiculous. Now I will never be able to actually play the game, since he has already started the town and is now in charge of all the decisions. I am beyond furious."

Almonds,"May 18, 2021",6,"I love Animal Crossing, but this game just feels like a let down.

Visually, this game looks FANTASTIC. There are so many small details that affect the world around you like the wind speed, how trees and other objects look in the rain, the sounds of different kinds of shoes walking across the ground, it’s great.

Terraforming is nice, putting furniture outside is cool, and crafting is a fun idea. I actually really love how this game starts out. I love that each day the island is growing, you get new items, and meet new characters as they slowly come to your island. But I feel like after this “tutorial” ends, I don’t really want to play anymore. In New Leaf your always building up stuff even after the beginning. I feel like New Horizons just stops in giving you major reasons to play the game.

Villagers are also a major issue. I never feel like actually interacting with a villager anymore. If I do I just mash the A button barely processing what the villager is saying because they’ve already said this exact thing a million times before. They just aren’t interesting to talk to. I also hate that when you give them items, they seemingly always accept it. This behavior just comes off as so fake to me that I don’t like it. Please just say “no, this isn’t my style” or something. Animals clearly have preference as sometimes they’ll wear the clothing you give them and other times they’ll wear it one time and just place it in there house the next day to never be used again.

I also find that furniture sets have less variety. So many items have been removed from New Leaf, it’s sad. Speaking of which, why did they completely cut gyroids from this game??? I thought before New Horizons that they would never remove Gyroids because they were in every single Animal Crossing game beforehand. But yet, here we are.

Also why is there only one shop upgrade? Seriously? And this can be done in like 1 month... Also why is Mable the only one to get a store, what about Kicks and Leif? Couldn’t they have been a similar thing to how Mable worked?

When this game can out, it was SUPER bare bones. Though this game was heavily reliant on updates for content... so okay I guess. Until you realize that most of the updates focus on some one day event that has already been in the previous Animal Crossings game. It’s disappointing how much new content were in these updates.

As many people have described New Horizons as a Happy Home Designer sequel. And that’s really what this game is. It focuses a lot on customization. But that’s not really my favorite feature. It’s the villagers. New Leaf didn’t really have the best villagers. I thought, “they can’t get any worse right? They can only get better.”

Well... guess my “hopes” were too high.

This game is fine on its own but Animal Crossing has been separating the main theme it started from, which is “family, friendship and community.”"
leonardo1606,"May 18, 2021",9,one of the best nintendo switch games but it is not for everyone if you are looking for a relaxing game that lets you squeeze your creativity to the fullest this is your separate game that you can dedicate more than 500 hours but if what you are looking for is action and destroy monsters better get away and is more for 1 person so if you want a good multiplayer game choose another game
Policcillo,"May 16, 2021",0,"This game is virtually an alpha version of what i'm sure they planed. Are the bones of a promissing game, but as any alpha, it can barely be considered as a game. Boring after the first hours, all the good critics this game recived are the resoult of Nintendo paying more atention to buy good reviews than to the developement itself. Sad to see how this beloved saga suffered such degeneration thanks to the new Nintendo politics, cheap companny, cheap game."

Wojogat,"May 10, 2021",0,"The most abysmal game of the Nintendo Switch, if not, all of Nintendo's game consoles... ever. Abysmal is just one of the thousand words I have to say of this game. It is subpar, it ****, it is unbelievable. I believe it's the worst game ever created in the history of mankind. This may sound extremely harsh, but to me, it is just 1% of what I feel about this game. This game is remotely awful. Plastic graphics that look more flat than a line, repetitive guitar music that sounds like it came from a cheap royalty-free music selection, repeating villager dialogue that just feels like they are on loop, and it never ends. I can't believe how atrocious this horrible game is. I cannot even express my anger to this insane game. If I were to continue, I'd start a whole rant here, so I'm just going to stop here. 0/100. Not even a single decimal I can give it. It is dreadful, and I cannot take the anger any longer. In my book, this game is unspeakable. Horrendous. Again, I'm just going to stop here. I cannot talk about this game any further."
IfSeen,"May 10, 2021",0,"I'm just not getting all of the hype with this game. I'm REALLY disappointed with this game. I expected to find some type of cool island with buildings and structures, as shown in commercials, but there's nothing there. It's misleading. I was told to play previous games. So, you what I did? I replaced the game. I said I wanted the 3DS version instead. They gave me the 3DS version and $30 credit. (since it cost only $30) I had a New Nintendo 2DS XL for games like Mario Kart 7, Super Mario 3DS (The 3D one, I have the 2D one, too), Miitopia, and Tomodachi Life. I like the Tomodachi Life game, and it was similar, so what the heck, I gave Animal Crossing 3DS a try. I do not regret it, and find it to be the BEST decision I ever made. They had BUILDINGS! It had LIFE! I enjoyed 3DS, 10 TIMES BETTER, in the FIRST DAY, than Animal Crossing Switch ever did, in THREE DAYS! I may do a review on Animal Crossing 3DS in the future, but it's too early to decide yet. Heck, many critics reviewed the game too early! Why count any of the critics before the release date? I would give Animal Crossing Switch a 1, but I can't. I did not have any fun, except for the airport thing, which the train thing was a huge improvement over the Switch version, so I can't even give it a 1. I will give it a 4/100 (0.4/10), because it was playable, at the beginning."

They could’ve made New Horizons a side-story game if it weren’t for three things. The NookPhone (and the whole “modernization” thing) and the sequel references, (because it would take place before them) and the most important thing: MORE STORYLINE! I know Animal Crossing  isn’t supposed to be a story mode game, but New Horizons feels like it’s supposed to be that way."

Wixoni,"May 8, 2021",0,"The game is horrible. Plain horrible. First of all, it included no manual! How am I supposed to figure out what to do without a manual? Overall, music is boring and repetitive. Only one song! Dialogue can be repetitive. Only two villagers! Uncalled for Crafting and DIY and Phone! I gave it a try, it had a 90 Metascore, and most of the user reviews complained by more than one island, which is stupid, but I didn’t care. Wrong! IT WAS RIGGED! The day after I ranted the max out of this game, I saw a review with a critic score of 5/10! The lowest here was a 7/10! Metacritic is rigged, and I do not trust them! DO NOT TRUST THEM! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I haven’t played previous AC games, I may give New Leaf or the GameCube one a try sometime in the future. They look, at least visually and gameplay-wise, a lot better. They seemed to have more content. After looking at recent reviews, I decided to do the same and refund my game. I suggest you do too! I don’t know about previous games, but I’ll give it a shot. A lot of people are suggesting it, so what the heck. Why not. They are considered superior versions, so be it. I’ll give them a wild shot. But for this game? 0/10. I can’t give it any higher. I suggest you do the same."
HowTo,"May 7, 2021",0,"Don't trust the critics, they are false. I've seen critics with lower ratings than a 70. Overall, the game is disappointing and lacking. False advertising, updates are lackluster, and the game is unplayable. It's buggy as well. Some sprites wouldn't load until 30 seconds later. 0/10."
Kefero,"May 7, 2021",0,"The game is visually alright. However, it is quite horrible compared to other Animal Crossing games. Not only this, but the fact that it is marketed as relaxing throws me off. Animal Crossing is supposed to be fun, not relaxing. A very terrible title, and have got my refund two weeks ago."
atejedaw11,"May 5, 2021",9,"This is my first Animal Crossing, and I cannot stop playing, it is a very relaxing game and has a lot of things to do, really linking it so far."
Tabarnacul,"May 3, 2021",2,"Bought this game to relax and feel free.
Bad choice. All the game you are in debt and tom nook take all the credit for the work you do.
VERY basic and repetitive.
The character will tell their intro lines EVERYTIME you talk to them. Grindy AF"
SuperK27,"May 2, 2021",9,"A fantastic addition to the Animal Crossing series. A new purpose and island full of characters make this game much more special in my heart. With countless updates, this game will be fresh for years to come."
Meowshark,"May 1, 2021",4,"Let me first start off saying I'm a huge AC fan. With that being said, wtf happen nintendo? It's been past a year now and their updates are pure garbage in comparison to what New Leaf provided.  The characters don't have any life to them, if you have more than one personality type prepare to read the same dialogue again and again. This is unavoidable dude to you being allowed 10 villagers max and there being only 8 personality types in the game. I'm really frustrated and confused as to why I'm paying for Nintendo online membership to utilize the games island backup service but if I ever wanna restore my island save I need to contact Nintendo support and have them hold my hand though the process. Long story short get the game play for a year or buy new leaf and have fun."
Andrewash316,"Apr 30, 2021",0,"I bought this game as a joint venture for me and and son, as it's been raved for its help against mental illness. My son turns out not to be interested in the game. He would sooner play Minecraft but he has start the world and is the king user.

Myself and my wife are player two and three.. effectively visitors on our sons island. We can't progress in the game. Can't move forward with the story or anything it's like we're on a limited trial version of the game.. The only way round this apparently is to buy a second or third switch!  Which frankly is completely unacceptable! Nintendo and the animal crossing team need to fix this asap."
Traumvita,"Apr 30, 2021",9,"Typical Animal Crossing. Fun, cute, and enjoyable. Switch visuals for it are top tier and it'll last for years. Could use some improvements but overall a great experience."
themangoose,"Apr 29, 2021",2,"Animal Crossing in name and villagers only.  This game is missing so much and is so incomplete.  They sold it under the promise that there would be meaningful updates which they have failed to deliver on.  The only content updates were parts of the game that were not quite complete when the game released such as diving or the museum/ artwork, but it was obvious they were supposed to be in the game as people could glitch into the water to swim and the spot for Redd to show up was already there.  What the hell did they do with the extra six months they took after the first release date before actually releasing?  Meanwhile they add a few clothing/ furniture items every month and boldly call it a ""free update"".  Where's the coffee shop, shampoodle, fortune teller, GYROIDS FFS, store upgrades, shoe shop, gracies, mini games, etc etc etc.  If it wasn't severely time gated then the main story would have been done in a day if that.  What a rip off and blatant lie to their promise.  The only reason I gave it a 2 was I did enjoy what little of the game there was.  New Leaf was 10x the game. Pretty typical of Nintendo and their over-glorified mobile tablet now."
danxz5,"Apr 26, 2021",0,"The customization is aight, but Nintendo needs to be held accountable for **** practices in this game. Less content than New Leaf, one island per Switch, and everything is so bland and dull after playing for a little bit"
3dgel0rd,"Apr 25, 2021",0,This game is absolute garbage I can't believe Nintendo of all people somehow messed up animal crossing it takes too long and the controls are like playing Call Of Duty with the resident evil tank controls. Nintendo should look up to Bubsy 3D which has controls that are silky smooth and a story that makes more sense than the kingdom hearts games
MaddoxWhite,"Apr 24, 2021",4,"I'm so torn on this game. It's fun for a while, but you can't stop playing or you're punished. The menus are so long and tedious. Only the first player can do certain stuff on your island. You can only have one island. The game has missing content from New Leaf that is slowly added back.

I was going to give this a 5 at first, but I'm just now realizing how much this game hates it's players. 4 it is."
Doolli,"Apr 12, 2021",4,So I was play enjoying the game but I didn't mean to time travel and now I can't go back to my original file and I don't want to retry the game because I like my villagers and I was wondering if their should be a save file where when you can go back to a old save as in you make a save and a few months of you playing you can go back to that first save but you can't go to your future island?
Nick384,"Apr 12, 2021",10,"Es un juego realmente adictivo, y es realmente entretenido buscar a tus vecinos favoritos y diseñar tu isla, pero comprendo las quejas de una isla por sistema y eso me parece una táctica codiciosa por parte de nintendo, pero también hay que tener en cuenta el resto de aspectos del juego antes de criticar"
redpandaman,"Apr 6, 2021",0,this game **** the whole game to me is boring im so bored when i play i try to get far but i cant without being bored I love new leaf and i was dissapointed when i played new horizons and i was glad to see that i can place stuff outside but the stuff is to expensive i cant get bells fast enough i don't see enough rare bugs and fish so i cant get enough then they added swimming but that boring i want to decorate that is my favorite thing to do but its to expensive as i said also crafting is useless like i never use it its also so annoying how it requires some stuff that is sometimes like 20 gold nuggets and sometimes like 5 stone i just hate the game
RapidSpeed,"Apr 6, 2021",8,A bit boring at some points. You either love it or hate it. Good **** game nonetheless.
HydraBenny,"Apr 6, 2021",0,"Got this for my 4 year old daughter and Im helping her read it and get set up. My 8 year old son wanted to have a go since it's his switch and daughter was happy for him to make his own island and play it sometimes. Only issue is you are only allowed to make one island... Ever. I don't want him playing her island and rushing past the tutorials as she needs the help to understand what to do.

So until nintendo make the simple addition of multiple save slots ie like every Mario game they've ever made, then the rating will have to be a 0 due to the problems this decision has made for us. Kids aren't happy."
Invoked79,"Apr 5, 2021",0,"I've played the game out of curiosity. What a dufus waste if time. Nonsensical childish concepts. I don't care to maintain a candy house and island, seriously, it does NOTHING to me. If I itch for some maintainance time I've got plenty to do around my actual house and car. Hugely popular game though. People being people I guess. The latest games I've completed are Control, Last of us II, Death Stranding, Plague Innocence. Definitely not my cup of tea sorry.."
Old_Duck,"Apr 4, 2021",9,"By far one of the best games on switch I would say. Being able to escape the real world and make a deserted island your new home is a fantastic experience, and now being able to craft furniture and pop it outside is a massive improvement for the animal crossing series.

This game is extremely addictive, as there is so much to do with your island. Eventually you will probably get sick of it, but you only feel like that after you've played it for ages.

A common gripe I have seen is tools breaking. Yes, it can be a little bit annoying at times, but it certainly shouldn't stop you from playing this fantastic game, and I didn't find that it disrupted my gameplay too much.

I highly recommend playing this game, as it will provide hours of fun for anyone."
BLG,"Apr 3, 2021",9,"The Animal Crossing series has created a unique sense of relaxation and joy for close to twenty years. The newest entry, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, continues that tradition while elevating the gameplay to new levels. This elevation in gameplay is quite literally in-game now where a player can actually change the geography of their island. Island terraforming is debatably the biggest addition to this version of the game. In past iterations, customization was reserved for the players home and clothing, but it is now possible to modify everything from where your cliffs and rivers are located, to a coffee cup placed on an outdoor table. The debut of vast island customization options are accompanied by a robust crafting system. Players can now gather resources located across the island to craft custom furniture and tools. These new aspects feel like they were heavily influenced by survival games, like Minecraft, but they still retain the Animal Crossing charm that fans cherish.

One added survival game mainstay that has caused some outcry amongst Animal Crossing fans is tool degradation. In previous entries, tools like shovels, fishing rods, and nets could be used indefinitely without breaking, but in Animal Crossing: New Horizons players have to fight the constant battle of tools being destroyed through use. It appears that this decision was made to strengthen the need for the crafting system, however it seems to impede on the relaxing elements of the game, like fishing. One of the most frustrating aspects of this game is being in the midst of a peaceful fishing trek around the permitter of my island only for my rod to break with a half full inventory of fish. Then forcing me to return to my islands town center to craft a new one. In the past, this return to town was driven by a need to sell your goods from that fishing session. This rewarding journey into town to sell your commodities is now joined by a similar but shameful trip into town to craft another fishing rod. This new element has certainly detracted from the joyful and relaxing cornerstone of fishing in Animal Crossing games.

Though the crafting system is a cumbersome addition in regards to tools, its inclusion has certainly evolved the overall gameplay from a depth perspective. It has added more incentives to collect items and forage for resources across your island while rewarding you with interesting things to craft. Island customization is a welcome addition that can result in hours of rewarding gameplay. One of my favorite things to do is to add a small decorative piece to the island and wait to see if my wife notices when she is playing with her character. I don’t ever see my island being “complete” and I plan to constantly tweak aspects of it throughout the years.

Island customization adds to the replay-ability of the game, but something that pulls me back in even more are the seasonal updates and events that Nintendo releases for free. Two large updates were summer updates that debuted new gameplay elements to the Animal Crossing franchise like swimming in the ocean and diving to the depths of your coasts to retrieve sea creatures. Nintendo is even teasing their next big update which appears to be a Halloween themed addition. These updates provide a reason to hop back in and you will quickly find yourself **** right back into the joyous gameplay.

One unfortunate side effect of island living in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is that it minimizes the enjoyment, previously supplied in previous entries, of adventuring to other islands. In previous entries, players could leave their continental town and take a boat ride to explore a tropical island where unique fish and items could be found. This enjoyment to escape your typical scenery has been replaced with the option to take a plane ride to randomly generated islands. Beyond plundering an island of its fruit and potentially discovering the elusive tarantula island, the incentive for players to get away isn't quite there anymore. An update that I would love to see Nintendo explore would be to diversify what you might find when taking a plane trip. Potentially discovering different biomes and fauna on these excursions would be a fantastic way to incentivize exploration and could recapture the magic of island visits from previous entries.

Overall this entry is a welcome addition to a beloved pedigree of games. Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes the chill and relaxing vibe of previous titles and modernizes it with more customization and structure. For Busch League, this game bordered a 9.5 out of 10, but features like item degradation and a less enjoyable island exploration process were steps back for the series. Busch League Gaming gives Animal Crossing: New Horizons a 9 out of 10.

Piemancer,"Apr 2, 2021",5,"In theory - this supposed to be the most sandboxy sandbox of them all. But sadly, this game feels like... job? I mean, I like always having something to do but in here it's just so forced and come on - artificial restrictions of the gameplay based on real life time? Who came up with this nonsense?
Get when discounted and play when you don't have anything engaging. A coffee break timewaster. This is what this game really is."
DieterU,"Apr 1, 2021",7,"Such an amazing game, but why do I get so burnt out? I don't know if it's my fault or the game's, but it definitely does negatively affect my feelings towards the game. Also there's just some small stuff that would make the game a lot more enjoyable that Nintendo just keeps on not implementing. Still really amazing though."
ShyKitty,"Mar 31, 2021",6,"My emotions has been a roller coaster ride with this game so far since I never experienced playing New Leaf. I've clocked about 150 hours into this game so this is my review so far:
The best way I can describe this game is that at times it feels like the Sims 4 but with animals. At times it can come off as just a choir and décor game were all you do is just the same thing day in and day out: go fishing, look for shells, sell or buy something, gardening, talk to neighbors who really don't have much of anything important to say.  It just comes off as very repetitive with extremely slow progress. The only reason I've clocked this many hours is because I started this game off with my fiancée at first, it was fun for a while until you notice that this game is not meant to be a two person player type of game. Who ever is first player, you will have to follow them around *everywhere* they go and if you don't then you will get poofed to the location that they are in.  This makes multiplayer extremely frustrating when you want to do two different things on the opposite side of the island cause it's impossible to do. One of you will just have to sit there and wait and occupy yourself with something in the immediate area first player is in until they decide to move. This game doesn't allow two or at least 3 different saves you are only stuck with one island, in my opinion, this was a terrible decision for this game and shouldn't have been done. My fiancée had lost interest at playing at one point since things were to slow to his liking, I continued playing but noticed I was getting no where with my island, not much of anything was occurring until I released my fiancée was still player one. I ended up deleting the first save and started fresh.

Once I started over, I noticed huge amount of  improvement. I noticed more bugs, got more land and started meeting more characters, so that is an upside. Now that I'm somewhere in the middle of updating my new island, I released  that you or your villagers can't interact with their surrounding, for the most part all of my villagers do is just walk around, talk to each other now and then, possible water the plants and that's it. Not once have a seen a villager or visitor go inside the museum, buy anything from the nook shop, you pretty much have to gift them everything. Some gifts that you gave them won't even be in theirs homes so it will be as if you never gave it to **** just depends on what the item is.  It would be nice if décor objects were interactable with my character and villagers, It's pretty to look at but just feels like pointless objects that do nothing but  lying around your island. I want more than just ""pretty to look at"" especially with a game like animal crossing.

Lacking the ability to evict certain villagers or decorate objects in this game is bothering when this entire game is about creating your own world.  I dislike that there is no option to go into town hall and evict a villager you no longer want on your island, your forced to be mean or isolate them in hopes of them wanting to move but there's no telling when that will occur same with waiting for a visitors to arrive at the campsite. It's also disappointing that you can't recolor store items or balloon gifts cause they may already come with variations, the only thing you can recolor is DIYs you make which is restrictive for no reason. Tools constantly breaking after a couple hits is huge annoyance! Recrafting the same **** over and over again is not fun after the 100th time, especially when you're adding iron to the object- it should last longer than that!

The game also has a huge problem with regeneration! I can't tell you how many times I have collected a bunch of fossils only for Blathers to tell me that one (sometimes NONE) out of many fossils I had over to him are good cause they are already in the freaking museum! Why is the island regenerating the same damn fossils!? This problem is also occurring with bottle and balloon DIYs and Nook Mile ticket islands that end up wasting 2,000 miles on cause it's the SAME empty island I've already gone to before despite them saying you can't ever visit the island again? I have yet to find any new villagers at my campsite or any of these islands. It makes traveling frustrating and not worth it at times.

This issue of blocking certain islanders to maintain 10 only caused Leif to stop showing up entirely. For the first time ever, I had to time travel (changed my time zone to Honolulu) just to get him to finally show back up again since the last time I had seen him was a while ago.  I'm still playing, I paid for this game so i want to see what happens next but there's room for tons and tons of improvement."
TropicalNayr,"Mar 29, 2021",9,"I would give this a 92%
This is a nice calm game to play solo
but the thing is if you have the same console and you want to start a new island on a new account you have to restart which is annoying they should give you a option but besides that it is a good game!"
Dufflad,"Mar 29, 2021",10,I've been playing Animal Crossing games since the very first. New Horizons is better in countless ways. New Leaf is the only other game I can think that had a handful of features that I wished made it to New Horizons. I'm over 100 hours in and still loving it.
muzmuz,"Mar 28, 2021",4,"No cooking/eating in a game like this? Horrendous. Animal Crossing: New Horizons sports a disappointing amount of content, absolutely unrepresentative of its steep price tag. Don't get me started with that one island per console and severe limitations on other users hogwash. I've never seen save files handled on any game as badly as this; not to mention this is a first-party title on a console, which makes it even worse."
schloobysclerm,"Mar 26, 2021",0,"This game and what is behind it is honestly appalling. Of course there's the one-island-per-console thing, which is terrible, but the game itself is just not what the Animal Crossing series is supposed to represent. The villagers have been completely sidelined and now do nothing to contribute to the game, repeating the same happy-go-lucky lines over and over. What happened to the sass? The gossip? And what happened to being part of a community? Now the main focus is showing off your island, but the game can't even do that right because of the horrible quality of life, such as the aforementioned island limitation as well as every minute task taking forever to do. Post-launch support has been revolting, and a year later this game still lacks most of the content of the previous titles. The developers refuse to listen to any gripes players may have, and do the bare minimum to constitute the game being $60, because they don't have to care because of how well this game sold. If you like the Animal Crossing series please DO NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS GAME."
francisjairam12,"Mar 24, 2021",6,"First things first let me just be clear here. I've been playing this game since the day it first came on March 20, 2020 so I have seen every single thing that the game has to offer. I do not hate New Horizons its still a good game despite the flaws it has. So anyways I feel stuck on what to do next? I completed my museum (all fossils, sea creatures, bugs, fish, statues, and paintings), terraformed my island the way I wanted it to be, and got the villagers that I wanted so now I am just asking myself ""what do I do now?"". This question has been bothering me for the longest time.

I seen all the events and they were fun for the time and whenever there was new stuff added I would be interested and try it out and then after about a day I get bored so quickly. I try to motivate myself to keep playing daily but it just doesn't feel good anymore. I have a lot of Nook Miles which I probably am not going to use given that I already finished hunting for villagers using nook mile tickets and I got amiibo cards last year. I guess what I'm trying to say is the game just feels stale and really lacks longevity. If anyone asks I did time travel. Only because it just took too long to like order stuff from the Nook Shopping and you are forced to wait a day until it comes tomorrow which was getting pretty annoying. I did the same thing when first building bridges and inclines when I was still making my island last year.

Ihis game feels like a Happy Home Designer 2.0 where it focus a lot more on designing rather than building a community. I try to feel more relax in New Horizons but because of how terrible the Villager dialogue is I just cannot do it. I took a break from this game, came back hoping something actually would happen for the 1 year anniversary but nope all I got was a cake and the villagers just repeat the same topics."
Billy368,"Mar 23, 2021",1,"This game is pointless and stupid.  I don’t understand why the reviews are so good.  Progression is slow.  The tasks are repetitive.  No sense of accomplishment.  If you like spinning in circles for hours, then you’ll like this game"
kalequail,"Mar 23, 2021",0,"One year later, I still find this game a disappointment compared to its previous games in the series. Characters are boring, the island is boring without stores or any tasks. Crafting tools is tedious. Too much emphasis on customization without backing it up with all the features that usually make this series worthwhile. It hurts to rate this a 4 but with limited updates for holidays that should have been in the game since release. It just feels like this game was never finished. Waited a year in hopes things would get better but it doesn't seem like it is."
nicoleb90,"Mar 22, 2021",0,"Not worth the buy unless your a rich person. Sharing one island with other people can get really annoying, especially when you want to progress but you can not without the island owner progressing first. Its a huge waste of money, and Nintendo is just trying to take all your money from you."
ladiebird,"Mar 20, 2021",6,"I recently restarted my island after dropping off from the game around June last year and am enjoying it again so far, collecting all the bugs and fish and sea creatures and moving islanders in. It's a beautiful game, and I really enjoy the landscaping and creative freedom you have when creating your island. Unfortunately, after you finish building, there's nothing very worthwhile left to experience. I think this is why I stopped playing originally.

Compared to previous games, the events are much more focused around collecting items/DIYs than interacting with your villagers and the special visitors. As a result, every seasonal event feels sort of the same. The villagers themselves are also super boring to interact. At first, they give you tasks, but as you progress that seems to stop. Even then, the number of tasks you get isn't comparable to previous entries at all. It is very much unlike the previous games in that regard, where helping your villagers felt like a focal point. Villagers of the same personality also feel very similar. I think this is because they tend to talk about what you did yesterday, rather than asking questions or talking about themselves. I've heard this is because of the way dialogue is prioritised, not because it's limited.

The incremental updates have improved the game over time and kept things interesting, and since Nintendo says the game should have a 3 year lifespan, we can probably expect more. Long story short, if you like the idea of designing and collecting (bugs, fish, fossils, art, DIYs, items etc), buying New Horizons is well worth the time and enjoyment you'll get out of it. If you prefer the older games because of the dynamic interactions you get with villagers, or New Leaf for the interesting/varied seasonal events, maybe skip this one out."
Demonrex,"Mar 20, 2021",9,"It is a perfect life sim game with one substantial drawback - if you own only one switch console there is no way to create more than one island. It does not affect me, because even if there was an option to start separate island, I would not like to do so. However, there should be an option.
And only because of that I rate this game 9/10. Overall it is very solid game, that I recommend to anyone."
PiePad,"Mar 17, 2021",9,Esta divertido y todooo eso mi unico problema es el crafteo de objetos es lo que no me gusta del juego fuera de todo eso para mi esta bien
hknyrbkn,"Mar 16, 2021",5,"So I had written another review where I gave Animal Crossing: New Horizons a score of 10. On the anniversary of the game, I lower it back to 5 as the developers did NOT deliver the updates that they had promised. The game is barren, and nothing changed since last March when the game launched. For a long-term game like ACNH, this is unacceptable. Update by update, it just got more boring."
Loozer,"Mar 11, 2021",10,The game has a slow start but after playing it for 3 weeks now and I am addicted to it. Even if I have nothing to do I'm still playing just walking around.
Reefyza52,"Mar 10, 2021",10,"Gameplay:
Animal Crossing New Horizon is a life simulation game based On a world full of cute animals. Your goal in this game is to build a house, craft tools, and beautify your tropical island. You have to borrow the "" Bell "" which is the currency in this game from Tom Nook to pay the debt, players can get from doing a variety of in-game activities.
This game is based on real-time on doing the activity on the islands every activity takes time to finish. It has a free play style. You can start by building a house, decorate a garden, go fishing and do gardening or catching insects, and others. The game also has upcoming events to explore based on real-world events. Animals in your village can interact with you on your island which is the charm of this game.
The game also features seasonal events like the previous ones, such as winter or summer, with different fruits or fish and insects.  You can also be able to select the region of your island which will affect the environment in the game. The uniqueness is that players can choose the location of their neighbor's home. Of course, players can be able to bond with their neighbors by interaction, and it will result in the acquisition of cool items and the events that will occur.
Animal Crossing New Horizons also has an online feature system where you and your friend's island. You can do activities together which makes the game even more fun. We have the ability to customize the island with the Terraforming feature which is a new system in the Animal Crossing franchise.

Graphics:
The arrival of Animal Crossing New Horizons on Switch comes with great graphics performance. Because a hybrid console specification makes it perform much better than the previous games. The graphics in the game still come in the same style that looks lovely. The character design is not different from the original, but it is cute and looks very good, and has always been unique to the Animal Crossing series. The game has a very nice color scheme in design that is pleasing to all ages. The camera angle in the game can be adjusted a little.

Soundtrack:
Nintendo has brought the talented team of musicians behind Animal Crossing: New Horizons' music back together for a beautiful acoustic performance with the stylish tropical life simulator's soundtrack that includes more than the 96 K.K. Slider songs that players can collect and listen to.

Overview:
Animal Crossing New Horizon is very free. This game can be very enjoyable when we have to stay at home to enjoy an island full of activities to do. This game can still play for years without the same boredom. Even though the game pace looks a bit slow, there is a lot of hidden stuff in the game to unlock waiting for you to explore."

Pand4th,"Mar 4, 2021",9,"It's an amazing game - such a shame that people who enjoy the game give it bad reviews for lacking a feature they'd want in.

Don't be fooled by the mixed user reviews - it's an amazing game that made my Quarantine and Corona times enjoyable - time was basically melting away - even though I'm more of a pro gamer... and yet I enjoy the heck out of this casual game"
Geek_In_Red,"Mar 1, 2021",0,"The game reminds me of the much-needed escapism Captain America provided to children and soldiers alike during WWII. The game is perfect other than the fact that Nintendo is making me share my island with my family. I wish island sharing was optional. If this is changed in future updates, I will change my ranking to 10. I don't understand why Nintendo is so anti-fun and has to backtrack on anything good they do. The sharing has gotten so bad, that my sister removed me from our island on this game Nintendo charged $60 for and I can't play it anymore."
Fluffito,"Feb 28, 2021",3,"Cute, fun, laid-back time-filler. Bad value proposition, however. Not a great deal of content for the price.

Passing events/occurrences is frustrating. Missing (not being able to experience at all due to time/schedule constraints) meteor showers and more is a bother.

RNG with Redd’s artwork is especially bad."

Shadowsky101,"Feb 21, 2021",10,A very good game and came in the perfect timing. I can‘t stop playing this game!
Zaneder,"Feb 18, 2021",1,"I bought this game so my girlfriend and I could enjoy some quality, relaxing time under the covers together and play some video games. The idea of creating our own island sounded amazing! But the way couch coop is implemented is utterly terrible."
Drewmeadyy,"Feb 18, 2021",8,"I love animal crossing New Horizons so many gameplay features that keeps you engaged for hours on end, the charms and the cuteness of the animals is so heart-warming. After completing the storyline there is sadly little to do but still well worth the experience. Alas 8/10 a great addition to the animal crossing series."
thecasualgaymer,"Feb 16, 2021",4,"Animal Crossing is addicting and well made, but I am firmly of the belief that it is not ""good"". Lacking elements of both previous games and even the mobile game, this Animal crossing has placed all of its eggs into the crafting and island decorating basket.

It does a very good job and is very fun when you are crafting and decorating your island, but comes up tragically short everywhere else, feeling more like an addictive chore than any of its predecessors."
RianJohnson15,"Feb 15, 2021",7,"It's a well-made game though. I love how well detailed this game is, and everything you do before you get a 4-star island feels rewarding.  However the amount of activities feel so limited compared to New Leaf and GCN. Everything feels repetitive from the announcements to the villager dialogue. Also, the multiplayer **** and one island per console feels suspicious. It isn't like Wild World and its Spinoffs, but it isn't Top 3 best though."
Amajo,"Feb 15, 2021",5,"I was very hyped about this game in first month of playing. After several house and shop upgrades game became more boring. Repetitive announcements without good info like weather, who is at island, same route everyday and talking with villagers is not really entertaining-repetitive conversations. I'm stuck in lack of ideas for decorating, I wish that there were more items.  Multiplayer is really irritating, when a player invites more than one player (freeze screen when one is leaving).

Loading screens when I see my face on switch screen make me think: What am I doing with my life?. Was that Nintendo goal?
If yes, then be happy, you made it."
snoycel,"Feb 13, 2021",7,"Overall it is a good game and a great entry point for those who are new to the series.
The art direction,  music and design screams polish. BUT for those who are familiar with the series this game will likely leave you disappointed because the content just isn't there to keep you entertained once you have gone through the new features."
junkykunky,"Feb 9, 2021",7,"This game would be a 10/10 if it wasn't for the fact the game is stretched along days and months just to get certain things done. I also don't appreciate how you have to pay for two separate switches, two separate games each costing 40$ and a Nintendo switch online membership. If you look past all of that the game can be really really fun especially with fishing, crafting and villagers. Not a perfect game though."
CRoger013,"Feb 7, 2021",10,One of my favorite animal crossing games! This is one of the best Nintendo switch games from 2020
NedLeon,"Feb 7, 2021",0,1 Island per switch is anti-consumer design and a manipulative greedy business practice that should firmly rejected.
Vatsugt,"Feb 5, 2021",10,He gastado 270 horas en este juego en los últimos 2 meses... creo que eso explica mi gusto :)
wydy,"Feb 4, 2021",5,"There are only two kind of reviews here. The ""only one island per console"" critic and the people who love the game.

But I think that's not the only problem with the game. From my side there are two huge problems with the game.

You can't do really much on your island. You're possible actions on the island are extremely limited and the size of the island is small. There isn't much discover on your island. The game seems to miss a lot of feature to keep you interested for a longer time to play. Sure there are other Islands to discover, but they are randomly generated, small and don't add something new. They're just like your island with the same actions to do.
You can't plant different vegetables/fruit and farm it. You can't have animals for milking. There are Apple trees. But you can't make apple juice or marmalade. You can only pick up the apples and sell it. There aren't secret dungeons to discover, mysteries to solve. You can craft new items and furniture, but they're mostly only cosmetic and don't add new features. There is no discovery or crafting system to keep you interested.

They added a real time day. So it's always the same date and time as in real life. You can't go to sleep and wake up on the next morning in the game. That add a huge time-sink in the game. You can play about 15min and then your daily ""work"" on the island is done and you have to wait till the next day. The same with the seasons, you have to play for a year to see every season in the game.

From my point of view, the game seems unfinished and miss a lot of features to keep you interested for a longer period of time"
BennyDahBoi,"Feb 3, 2021",7,"An interesting introduction for me to the Animal Crossing franchise, but a forgetful one at times..

I was browsing in a store one day with my family till I saw the Animal Crossing game on the shelf. Hearing everything that was great about the game, I thought I would give it a go. I absolutely loved the first few weeks of playing, with tutorials being idiot-proof whilst also bringing adventure to your mind, where you can ponder what is behind that river on your island.

I also absolutely loved the fact that you could buy tickets to visit new, intriguing areas where you can expand your own island's population from. The art style is very pleasing on the eyes and I the music when I boot up the game almost always gives me a joyous feeling. However, I rarely hear that music anymore...

After around 1 and a half months of playing, I just stopped. I had accomplished everything I had wanted to, bridging to new areas, getting nicer equipment and upping my population. I had realised then that the game mostly was about collecting and decorating. It just did not feel satisfying when I placed a piece of furniture or caught a new fish where a few more pixels where coloured than the other fish I caught 2 minutes ago.

A few days ago, my sister wanted to hop on and play, but little did we know, a 1 island per console restriction permitted that.

Another drawback was the date and time ""hacks"" everyone pulled off with the reselling of turnips, that ruined a lot of fun when friends would just visit me and drop money everywhere whilst I wanted to catch fish and earn bells the legit way.

Overall, this Animal Crossing game can be quite flawed in some ways but I did enjoy my time while I found it fun. I recommend it still as games with stories can take tens of hours to finish until you stop playing, whereas with this game, HUNDREDS of hours can be put in and you can still be having the time of your life!"
rschaper,"Feb 2, 2021",0,"RIPOFF! $60. for a one-person game. Can't even buy and use another. No idea my wife wouldn't get her own experience crafting and controlling development. My gosh, you can have multiple users in Breath of the Wild which is magnitudes more complex. This is easily solvable and simply unforgivable."
Polarisao,"Feb 1, 2021",5,It shouldn't get the praise it gets - Its a very basic game which can be easily outmatched by a number of life games on the switch. That's why I give it a 5 because the novelty wears off fast and hard and I haven't touched the game since. Won't be buying again
Simpson_761,"Jan 31, 2021",5,Not allowing more than one save file per switch? Forcing to time gate you in a paid title? Why can Nintendo be allowed to get away with things like this when Xbox and Playstation would be HATED for doing similar things?
BoredShorts,"Jan 31, 2021",0,Wanted to have a go at my sons game. Couldn't play without crashes his island. I'm not buying a second console just to experience a solo game each. Trying to extort switch sales by limiting functions in their games. Tut-tut Nintendo.
Hazyskyy,"Jan 28, 2021",0,"Limiting the game to one island per switch is ridiculous. Nintendo just keeps getting more mediocre and greedy instead of getting better. There is no good reason for this limitation,  hope y'all fix it cause this is effed up."
Volkagen,"Jan 28, 2021",3,"It's just boring, progress is slow and a couch co-op mode is made in the worst way what you can think about. There isn't a split screen just one lead player and rest of them need to follow. Only one have access to equipment. It is just terrible experience. Even if you want to fish with other... You can't because usually there is just one fish on the screen which you can get."
miguelsgamingch,"Jan 27, 2021",9,"This is the best one yet in the animal crossing series.
I Like it so much, I like roleplaying at my island as a country and I'm the president lol
There is 1 Con tho, this is why I put a 9 instead of 10.
You Need Nintendo Online To Travel to my friends island."
MrGreen3339,"Jan 26, 2021",4,"I play solo so I don't care about the 1 island per console thing, and it's been done to death already so let's talk about the game's other glaring flaws.

- The dialogue is repetitive and uninteresting across the board. It makes me want to skip NPC text and makes villagers feel like decorations rather than actual people.
- Early game progression is so linear. Your early villagers are selected from 2 personality pools rather than from all villagers.
- The music is very forgettable outside of the K.K. Slider songs (which arguably don't count due to all but 4 of them returning from previous games) and the main theme.
- There's only 1 shop upgrade, despite the older titles having 4 upgrades.
- Content is drip fed through updates rather than being available from the start, which brick walls you if you finish the new content too fast.
- So many classic NPCs are gone for no reason.
- Crafting is cumbersome and feels unneeded after a while.
- The whole game feels like it's focused on being a sandbox instead of a life sim.

Seriously, if you have a 3DS, buy New Leaf instead. It's better in basically every way and is significantly cheaper. Or just emulate the older ones"

Cybercrox,"Jan 21, 2021",0,"Extremely disappointed with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. We bought this game thinking the whole family could play. Turns out only one person can truly play. Secondary and any additional players on the island are not able to participate in the story line or further the game progress. If you are a secondary player, you are doomed to an existence of collecting junk and decorating your house. That’s it. Extremely boring. This game will be thrown on the junk heap of games that are never played. What a waste of money."
Cezico,"Jan 21, 2021",8,"A chill, slow, and relaxed experience that is a must in any casual gamer's collection. The slow pace admittedly isn't for anyone, but it's perfect to pick up for an hour each day and just explore your island."
Gontrand00,"Jan 20, 2021",7,"Being playing for more than a month and I like it. It's a relaxing experience.

Though. They **** need to fix the multiplayer thing, which is utterly trash and so disrespectful for nintendo's fan. I play solo so I don't care, and I will never pay for their online trash service. I would probably never have bought this game if it was to play with my friends or roommate (if I had one).

When I compare the first AC on GCN to this one, we can clearly see that there are improvements (fortunately, lol). But even if every single details are nice, I'm kinda worried that the interest will wear out in a month or two. Like every AC games. Which is sad because they really could find ways to update it and make it more enjoyable to play, with significant updates like in MMO games. But we know Nintendo, it's never going to be the case. We are going to have cheap updates every 4 months for Valentine, Halloween, Christmas, etc... and that's it. I got it for half the price so I don't really care, but this game is never gonna be worth the full price or the online membership to play with your friends.

So play it if you're solo and can have it for half the price, or just pass."
Muzak,"Jan 18, 2021",7,This is an amazing single player game. Unfortunately the truly lovely dev team didn't learn from other contemporary multiplayer games. You can't join your friends easily because there are 5 obnoxious hoops you have to jump through. Fix the multiplayer please! Have an app on the nook phone that just teleports you an online friend if they accept. There should not be such a tremendous roadblock even if they were trying to protect kids from online gaming or something.
FrostAwxYT,"Jan 16, 2021",5,"I like it, every day something different happens. But it kinda gets boring after time"
amin-Ra,"Jan 14, 2021",4,"This empty, life-less husk **** is an insult to the name Animal Crossing. Out of hundreds of NPCs with rich, vibrant (and seemingly unending) dialogue, New Horizons gives us a handful who say something different a grand total of one time a day. How anyone who was a real animal crossing fan did not immediately storm this developer’s headquarters and spit on their placard is beyond my understanding. Go look at your town. It’s very pretty, fancy, and oh-so- Minecraft????  Customization is great but these NPCs (a large part of what made the older games so fun) have no soul. I’m sure marketing made a great pitch for online play and yadda-yadda but how no one brought up the fact that this game is primarily going to pique the attention of a niche audience who has been waiting for years and who did not go ga-ga for online play (mostly because it largely didn’t exist on this platform) is also baffling. I hope that future updates will fix this glaring issue but fear that even the most honed necromancy will not have the juice to bring our islands to life."
Jewboy1993,"Jan 14, 2021",2,"Stopped playing this game months ago after amassing 100's of hours and just getting bored.

**** you nintendo."
Caseydonelson9,"Jan 14, 2021",0,"The fact that nintendo will not budge on their stupid ""one island per console"" scam is disgusting. The november data transfer update still fails to negate the fact that you'd need TWO CONSOLES. Considering this game has spent it's whole existence in the covid crisis when people can't afford to feed their families letalone to go out and buy two or more $300 consoles... you would think the company could be a little less tone deaf. This puts Nintendo ahead of EA games when it comes to corporate greed. They already have a monopoly on many of the most popular IPs in video gaming..."
Azvd,"Jan 11, 2021",0,"Nintendo, the company that we love that also hates us, really stupid decision for an island per console. I'm feeling robbed."
Fauz1,"Jan 11, 2021",10,"This game is great and although there are some problems, such as the island resident and a few others,  it´s still a great game."
Sultan88,"Jan 10, 2021",9,"In my eyes, this game is near perfect. Granted, I don't have the gripes other people have with the game as I've spent most of the game playing on my own so far (girlfriend is getting a switch this week). The progression is not a big issue, it keeps me coming back to the game every day. There's not always a ton of stuff to do everyday, which is one of my issues, but there's enough going on to keep you coming back and coming back each day.

Villagers feel reasonably alive and you actually begin caring about them, giving and receiving gifts is a nice touch. I also started out with a sisterly villager (Rocket) who always seems to give me recipes and gifts when I'm having trouble. For a lot of people this is the game that got them into Animal Crossing (it certainly is for me), and I don't think that's a problem at all as the game lays out a lot of the groundwork for you and explains a lot of the ins and outs fairly quickly. There is definitely some figuring out to do and that's fine.

Maybe the one island thing will become a problem for me in future, but at the moment it's not and I'm rather enjoying logging in every day and seeing what's new and what's going on. If you have your own Switch to have by yourself, I think you'll have fun with this game and get a lot of enjoyment out of it. For me it's a 9, for some others it might be a 5 (or lower) and that's perfectly fine. The gripes I've seen from others are legitimate, especially players who are sharing a switch as I can imagine that would get annoying so I'm not going to gloss over those but I will say it obviously hasn't been something that has affected me.

Where I think the game falls short from a 10 generally is there is a lot of waiting. Waiting can kill your enjoyment for that day and I've found myself quitting the game and waiting for the next day (which is occasionally 5am as I'm on Blathers' time). But with that said, I have logged into the game everyday since I bought it, and it's honestly a blast. 9/10 is a fair score for a game like this, at least in my opinion."
Fisstza,"Jan 10, 2021",9,"A great game and in my opinion the best animal crossing game ever. The graphics are a huge upgrade from its prequel and it offers almost everything an Animal Crossing game should have. In addition to this it also has an interesting setting and you can always find something to do. But although it is great I have two issues with this game: The lack of multiple islands on a single system have disappointed a lot of people and even though I am not bothered by it too much, because I have my own switch, I can definitely understand the criticism and my second issue is that I simply don’t enjoy talking to the villagers that much anymore. In past games villagers had more personality and could actually be a bit mean to you, in new horizons however I feel like the villagers are just always pretty nice and generic with sometimes lines repeating after you spoke to them a few times. In the predecessors I felt more attached to my villagers while in the current title they feel kind of bland and uninteresting. But despite those negatives it still makes a great game which I have put hundreds of hours into and is definitely worth it’s money. An outstanding experience but with a few drawbacks that don’t quite make it perfect in my eyes."
Novohart,"Jan 10, 2021",9,This game is super fun. But rate 0 for this game just because it have one island per 1 console isn't fair. I play alone so i haven't got problems with this.
ireneeegs,"Jan 9, 2021",0,"I've bought this game with my sister. Well, I thought it was me doing something wrong but now I see i'm not. The one primary residence per console is quite annoying. I'm extremely disappointed. Asking to fix it please!"
caysjose,"Jan 8, 2021",9,"Can you people give more fair score. Just because it upsetting you with that 1 system 1 island thing, everything else is bad so it's score 0"
leeaw,"Jan 8, 2021",6,"On one hand, I do truly adore this game. The ambiance is spectacular, the in-game holiday celebrations are something I genuinely look forward to, and the amount of connection I feel to my little town and villagers is a bit embarrassing, and seeing the community and creations within and surrounding this is fantastic. It's been genuinely helpful in establishing a routine while at home all day, and I owe it loads for that. On the other hand, I try to be objective on some level.
ACNH makes a number of significant improvements to player experience- but it stops so, so short. The one island per console restriction, the abysmal multiplayer that nearly (unintentionally) captures the absolutely dreadful, slow experience of going to a real airport, tool breakage that serves no gameplay purpose, excruciatingly slow animations for just about every action the player can preform, and so much more make this game so incredibly clunky. Nothing feels streamlined. Nothing feels good to interact with. The villagers have nowhere near enough dialogue to feel realistic, and at a point the gameplay loop gets extremely repetitive, and yet charm alone stops me from rating this any lower.
There's a lot to say about atmosphere in video games, and this is a prime example of the drastic effect it can have on games. If you're interested in a nice quaint experience, you should absolutely buy it. if you're looking for a good game, look elsewhere."

david_0313,"Jan 5, 2021",8,"I love this game and I think it offers a great experience overall. Although I have a lot of problems with the game, I always come back to it and it's one of the game's that I enjoy the most. I'm really mad at a lot of the poor design decisions the game has and how it sometimes destroys the relaxing premise the game offers the player and how easy it would be to solve them, but at the same time I'm amazed at some things the game does, as I said before it keeps making me come back and a lot of times I'm just hungry for more things to do cause I love spending hours in this game even with the many concerns I have about it.

New Horizons only makes me hope for a future AC game with all the great NH has while also fixing all the bad that it has and adding even more to the formula respecting its original purpose. I CAN'T NOT recommend this game when it has given me over 450 hours of play time."

From the game company that loved family environment you have created a destructive un fun and not nice game system for the family environment. A game i hoped would allow each person to express their individual creativity and share it with the family has denigrated into 1 family member having despotism over the shared experience.

Swerv,"Dec 30, 2020",5,"This is the first review I have written. Im not normally one to write reviews although I depend on them for all purchases. AC is not a bad game but while others find it enjoyable, I find it more of a chore with Nintendo forcing me to play the game the way they want.

1) One island per switch is annoying. This tied with the fact that only ONE person can do things like move / build bridges, stairs, & housing plots makes it extremely annoying when the island ""rep"" stops playing. Also, my partner & I have different tastes & playstyles. Forcing one island per switch was a terrible idea (but im sure they just wanted to force people to buy more Switches)

2) Load times are LONG. Breath of the wild, which is more intensive and large then this game, loads up in like half the time.  One of the biggest reasons I dont play anymore, is  because it just takes so long to get into the game and do the daily tasks.

The amount of dialog you have to sit through repeatedly + lack of bulk crafting added to the load times adds up.

3) Outside of events, the game is pretty stale. The amount of villagers keeps things interesting but after a week you heard all of Isabelle's basic greetings. Your person says the same cringy line EVERY TIME you find a fossil, catch a fish, ect."
Derbearz,"Dec 29, 2020",2,"So much missing content in this game, no NPC’s. Your villagers are all boring and have the same dialogue. The island customization is fun but everything else has no substance."
Euphara,"Dec 29, 2020",10,"I absolutely love this game! The gameplay feels nice, and the customization is a step up from New Leaf, the first Animal Crossing game I ever played. If you want local, same console multiplayer, this game is not for you. The local, different console multiplayer and online multiplayer where you visit other player islands is really nice. I'd recommend this game if you have a Switch."
Henwow,"Dec 29, 2020",1,"Brought this “game” for my girlfriend for Christmas, not being told upfront that having a second island is locked behind a £350 pay wall (having to buy a second console and second game) to enjoy your own island really ****!! 1 star because the developers tried to make a good game but greedy exes stepped in once again smh -.-"
lqstuart,"Dec 28, 2020",5,"The complaints about progression if you're player 2+ are entirely valid and I have a hard time wrapping my head around the thought process that led to those design decisions without chalking it up to stupidity or incompetence. If you don't care about having only a single island per console, or only one player who can progress the story--which I don't, I was honestly glad to not have to deal with that--then you still have to contend with the issues of being unable to build bridges or craft really basic furniture. On top of that, the controls are awful, dialog is incredibly repetitive and tedious, and for a game whose entire purpose is decorating your island, this has the worst customization options imaginable short of not actually offering any at all. If you don't believe me, then feel free to stop by my house full of urinals and giant baseball helmets because I can't buy a bed or a proper table.

This game was only a success because it coincided with a devastating global pandemic, and the previous installments were apparently even more boring and stupid. Neither of those are claims to fame that I personally would want."

It is a very fun game, but he is being kept from playing it, which makes it disappointing and less fun for me to play."
Myimshelp,"Dec 27, 2020",1,Don't understand the high high reviews on Animal crossing new horizons. You CANNOT play this game as a family unless you have an additional switch with an additional game cart. This is a money grab by nintendo..
clairmont,"Dec 26, 2020",0,"My spouse and I decided to get this game as a gift to ourselves for christmas, money was tight, but we heard such great things about Animal crossing so decided this was the game for us. I guess I should have searched for ""Is Animal Crossing trash for the second player"" before opening the game package(and voiding the return policy), but who would have though that would even be a concern. Well, it is absolute trash for the second player on the console. So unless you have multiple switches, and multiple copies of animal crossing, don't even bother getting this game if you intend to share with your family. I was OK with sharing an island with my spouse, but didn't realize that the game would make player two feel like a second class citizen, who's only goal in life is to work manual labor without any satisfaction of game progression opportunities."

I can't give a game a score above 0 if it isn't even playable to myself and many others (yeah secondary players can join an island, but let's be real they can't do much). Needing 1 console per player is insane, I hope they fix this some day."
silmaril464,"Dec 25, 2020",0,"I'm about to enter 2021, I can't understand why Nintendo, with its dire and incomprehensible decisions, spoils one of the best games that has been released this year on its portable console, making the absurd decision to allow only one island per console, limiting greatly increasing the game options to users who have not started the game, and forcing those players to play on the island that the first user created, limiting progress to the pace of the creator of the island. There is not even the option to buy another game for the same console, if you want to play on your own island, your only option is to buy a new console (€ 350). Thank you very much NINTENDO, thank you for taking care of and thinking about the people who feed you, your players."
Nastaboi3000,"Dec 20, 2020",0,"I'm sorry but this game was released incomplete. It has half of the content that New Leaf had on the 3DS, 7 years ago. No furniture sets, no gyroids, no upgrades for shops, no other shops, no rare sets, no silver tools, no various minerals, no minigames, the online is really awful and has a 40 seconds load time for each person that visits. I'll just go bacj to the 3DS as it had more content and actual STUFF to do besides just ""decorating"" which seems the whole point of the game as it is now. My advice is don't buy it. Updates won't even save it probably."
YoppaChanDesu,"Dec 17, 2020",8,"Was a good game for a few weeks, but the limited dialog from the animal villagers was pretty disappointing. The online connectivity is bonkers and is super annoying when connecting with multiple people. Not sure why I have to watch a 2 minute video everytime someone comes and goes from my island. The crafting system is a neat addition, but sharing the island on the switch means that resources are quickly used up by one player."
BigBrainVR,"Dec 17, 2020",5,"I love the game, fantastic and addictive, but I’m really bummed out now because after 40 hours my brother came and went on our shared switch and destroyed my island, chopping down trees, taking fruits, stealing fossils, etc. I’m very upset and I need more than one island per switch"

12/10 от меня!

just an amazing game. 220+ hours of pure delight! game with the friendliest community, with interesting features and just a positive mood! and with all this, the game continues to evolve. the seasons change, new chips appear that were not there before. if you have a Switch - you should definitely try this game.
with a Nintendo subscription, it's even more interesting - since you can play with a friend.
12/10 from me!"
chulapa,"Dec 14, 2020",9,"Pretty great over all, sharing a island might be lame, but I'm not a child who has to share his switch with brothers and sisters like a lot of these babies in the reviews giving the game a 0. Pretty relaxing and expands on mostly everything from the last games."
DrPopoDopolis,"Dec 14, 2020",8,"The multiplayer is very underwhelming. And so limited. So many things that you can do in single player are turned off in online multiplayer mode, so when my friends came to visit my town I honestly found myself waiting for them to leave so I could get back to what I was doing. Also, when inviting  2, 3, or more players to your town everyone has to watch a cut scene when anyone lands or takes off. It becomes a long annoying process. And then people try to leave while others come in and it becomes this bottle neck traffic jam. It gets annoying.

Otherwise the game is great for me, but I am not sharing my switch with anyone."

Willywonka180,"Dec 12, 2020",5,"Im so sad about this game, it has Not enough here to entice me to come back to it so often like the old games. If your gonna make a game so bland at least have good characters! These characters are boring with nothing good to do but walk around. In older games they acted like people. They could invite you over, have parties, actually be rude, and even give you tasks. In this you walk around, catch bugs, and earn money. That’s all there is to do. Gone is the interesting gameplay. But even the crapiest of games has some good. While I am playing the story based part of the game I had a grand old time. Tom Nook is actually pretty funny, and it’s fun. The rest is boring. Again I’m so sad to say this"
TheBestMarioFan,"Dec 12, 2020",7,"So I previously had a very positive review here. I really enjoyed the first week of the game and it is still pretty good. However, the more you'll play the more basic and uninteresting everything becomes. Characters have not a lot of things to say and they'll even repeat the same line for a few days in a row. To be honest it makes the game feel generic and while the in other games the villagers felt like real people, hre it feels like they are just basic NPCs. For me, this was my favorite part of New Leaf so that is why I edited this one. If you only buy this for the building part. Then buy it. It does that part very well, but if you want an Animal Crossing game with villagers that feel alive. I suggest you buy any of the other games."
CaptianGinyu,"Dec 11, 2020",5,"While I understand why people like this game... it's just not for me. I just couldn't keep playing it, and I just ended up moving on to other games. To me there just wasn't a whole lot to do, and every time you thought you were doing something cool you would have to wait a day for it, and don't even get me started on the menuing... Honestly, my favorite part of the game was catching bugs and fish, and while I can see why people like this game, it was just boring to me. My advice: wait for a big sale, or even better, just buy **** Valley."

DEATHPAW97,"Dec 8, 2020",0,This is the worst game in the series. First off after the start there is just nothing to do. Talking to villagers and becoming friends which is the whole point of animal crossing is horrible in the old games i felt like i made friends now if feels like i have a bunch of stuffed animal that say the same ten sentences when you press the leg. it could be a great game but it doesn't feel like animal crossing anymore.
Ab1980,"Dec 4, 2020",0,"WARNING: You can only have 1 island per switch console. So if you have multiple players in the house, you have to share the island. Not a bad thing in itself, but the special tasks to expand the island, add new residents, etc is limited to the first player who set up the island. Everyone else’s experience is severely limited, and that just plane ****. Is Nintendo that disconnected from its family user base? Very disappointing."

If 2 or more people play on the same switch It become bored for the other players. Thats why i give a 2 to the game"
4blackcat,"Nov 28, 2020",0,"As long as there is only one island per switch this game doesn't deserve anything less than a 0. Great potential but it is nothing more than a polished f*ck you towards every parent with more than 1 kid. bought it for my sister and my niece and nephew not knowing this was the case. (my sister is on welfare and can't but it herself for the kids) So now I'm either stuck buying another one or them selling it cause it causes problems for obvious reasons. If a second island would require a second version of the game, fair play, but a whole extra console? The sales department at Nintendo has been on some strong stuff to come up with this crap. Shame on you Nintendo, shame on F*ing you."

Happyspelling,"Nov 24, 2020",10,"I was super exited for this game when it was first announced. Animal Crossing is my favorite video game series. The wait was brutal, but was it worth it in the end? I'd say it is! The graphics look pretty nice, the music is cheery and relaxing, and the villagers are even more enjoyable than in previous games! This game isn't perfect though. It doesn't actually become like Animal Crossing for 10-20 hours. The good news is it's still fun during the beginning. The whole crafting mechanic is really only for those early hours. Once I livened up my island (cleverly named Island), I rarely ever crafted after that. I don't appreciate how desperate it is to be different from the rest of the series, because I really miss some of the old characters. I do love the new ones, and at least Dr. Shrunk isn't in this game... But I did have some problems. For one thing, why is there still a 10 villager limit? The first game had 15! Island is big enough to fit a few extra people (or animals)! I'd even settle for 12! Also when you use a Nook Miles ticket to visit a deserted island? It's a really cool idea, but the island is way too tiny, so there's nothing to do, and a villager will only appear there when your town isn't full. I really want to get some of the new villagers, but I can't when it's restricting your opportunities. Granted, I was lucky enough to find Judy, a new cub, on an island, but that was after farming like 10 tickets! Also, there have only been 8 new villagers shown at this point! Are those the only new ones? I mean, I really like them, but that's just pitiful. The amiibo functionality is good too, but the crossover villagers from Welcome Amiibo aren't in this game! I miss Inkwell... Also you just have to get extremely lucky to get a new villager. I really want Cyd the elephant and Raymond the cat in my town, but there's no amiibo for them... I'm suprised that I was able to talk about the negatives for so long... Now on to the positives! Let me just say I haven't been this happy playing a video game since...maybe never. This might be the happiest game ever made. I bet it could cure depression (I'm serious)! The characters in this game are way cuter and funnier here than in any other Animal Crossing game. Everyone has their favorite one/ones, but this gave me several new favorites, and I love my old favorites even more! This game also has a lot of funny dialogue (maybe more than Paper Mario: Color Splash). This game has so much personality, and I love it! Its just so much fun! Even pulling weeds is fun now! This game is my 3rd favorite Animal Crossing game, my 4th favorite Switch game, and is probably in my top 20 games of all time! It really satisfied my expectations. It was pretty much exactly as good as I thought it would be. Most games nowadays are either slightly better or slightly worse than you expect it to be. The delays and stuff were really painful, but it was worth the wait, and every Switch owner needs this game! (Also why are so many people complaining about the first player doing all the hard work for you? The others players get to enjoy Animal Crossing sooner.)"
Trisin,"Nov 24, 2020",0,"Nintendo is a constant disappointment.  This game allows ONE ISLAND. Nintendo refuses to add multiplayer options for titles that on all other consoles support. This game isn't for anyone who has MORE THAN ONE CHILD, despite Nintendo's attempts to advertise this device as multiplayer friendly. Justifying AC as having always being one island doesn't reflect on the fact this console is over double the price of past consoles and it's not a personal device any more."

Bluespell1,"Nov 9, 2020",6,I  Disappointed with the game. It's kind of a boring game. Not much to do for the most part and doing stuff feel's empty. I feel like it takes a very long time to get anything done. You get to the point were you have a large stack of crafting materials then half of what you would usually do is gone.
jake17,"Nov 8, 2020",8,"everything is pretty good but it feels some things are missing that were in the original.  the biggest issue for me is the lack of things to do, while yes you can fish I feel it would be fun to have un-lockable items that add mini games or nes games like in the OG.  I also don't care for the villagers attitudes because they have little to none.  you only care about looks because in the OG many had attitude and sas but all the villagers here have about 5 lines of dialogue and that's it.  finally I don't care about the updates because it feels like they were all ripped strait from new leaf.  But besides those minor complaints the game is extremely fun to play with friends and family so overall it is a good game small issues."

Every previous AC game didn’t require Internet, but this one does. I am warning you, don’t play this. Play the older games. If you have a GameCube or Wii, get Animal Crossing GameCube."
penebullone,"Oct 30, 2020",8,"Отличная и увлекательная ферма. Это моя первое знакомство с Энимал Кроссинг, и надо сказать, что я нереально рад, что имею возможность играть в эту сумасшедшую и умилительную игру. Еноты просто красавчики, мой остров просто райский уголок. Мы живём на острове с персонажем моей девушки и ещё десятью прямоходящими животными :))

Это весёлая и необычная для белого человека игра, но ловить насекомых и рыбу, выкапывать кости динозавров и просто радоваться беззаботной жизни на острове оказалось намного веселее, чем это звучит. Хорошая игра, 8/10

P.S. Все, кто внизу сетует на то, что им не повезло быть игроком номер 2 или 3, купите себе второй Свитч, вот и всё. На PlayStation тоже есть игры, в которые может играть только 1 человек, и, если кого-то это удивляет, то не занижайте оценку игре, хотя Нинтендо реально поступили немножко странно"
YanisPLAYER,"Oct 30, 2020",0,"This game deserved to be the game of the year, it is relaxing and super calm. It's a little management game where you have to manage your island,"
TheComplexWolf,"Oct 27, 2020",9,"I’ve been playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons since release day and it’s definitely saved me during these difficult months.

One big update in the latest Animal Crossing game is the ability to transform your island. The terraforming aspect really adds to the game and gives you endless possibilities when it comes to decorating your island. You can build your own decorations and furniture with materials you find, which help towards the goal of reaching a 5* island.

The villagers within the game are as adorable as always. An added bonus is that your villagers no longer leave without warning, so you can technically keep your favourite villagers on your island for as long as possible. You can also go out hunting for your next villager which is a fun element.

The regular updates keep players hooked to the game, particularly the seasonal updates such as Easter, Halloween, etc. Seasonal updates gives you additional goals to work towards which brings you back to the game yet again.

Whilst I always return to New Horizons regularly, I’ve found that in recent months that I spend less and less time playing as I’ve run out of things to do on my island, which is a shame. There’s always the possibility of redecorating your island, but once you’ve finalised your design then it becomes difficult to find tasks to do to keep yourself busy.

Another negative that seems quite small, but can become quite frustrating, is the lack of storage. Usually it wouldn’t be a huge issue, however when one big element of the game is to craft items to use across your island, having nowhere to store your materials over time causes you to dump items on your island, bringing the rating down. This is disheartening over time when you can no long aim for a 5* island due to items being dropped on the ground.

All in all, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a lovely, relaxing game that keeps you coming back for more. The game could easily be a 10/10 game if some of the small frustrations were fixed."
nedjones,"Oct 26, 2020",0,"If you have more than one person in your household that wants to play this game, everyone but the primary person is screwed.

I have been stuck with the small screen for months and despite the fact that my wife is done with the game I have no option but to use the lite version.  I pay for the online service but cant transfer my game between the two devices that I had to purchase! With every other game I own I can use both consoles as it suits. Nintendo has basically ruined the whole point of owning a Switch with this game. Again, terrible policy/customer service."
Resonator,"Oct 21, 2020",6,"This game is beautiful and relaxing, but for me they've fallen a bit short. The mechanics are simple, very simple, but I feel that a complex system will ruin the game. Would be very fun that they add minigames like in previous games, maybe a supermario in the NES or something like that, or a pinball on the pinball you can buy. The villagers are so cute, but the limit of 10 is stupid when you have a big island. Is always the same, they have something right but they fall short."
MatthewDavisMed,"Oct 17, 2020",9,This was a title that really surprised me. I've had so much fun getting into the world and gameplay experience.

ConsoleArgonaut,"Oct 13, 2020",6,"This opinion on the game is without including the new updates!

I hated this game for one reason: It absolutely wastes your time in every aspect of the game.
Why can't I craft multiple items of one type at once?
Why is the inventory so limited from the start?
Why are there always so many clicks you have to do for everything?
Also, Nintendo. Why can't I cloud save this game? I would like to uninstall it and come back to it later once there are quality of life updates, but I still have to have the icon on my switch no matter what? That just seems wrong.

Verdict: This game would be great with enough quality of life updates. As it stands tho it's a giant waste of time.

Rating:
Gameplay: 1/5 - Time wasting
Level Design: 4/5 - Great looking islands with nice exploration.
Soundtrack: 5/5 - Fantastic
Story: 2/5 - Everything this game needs, but nothing special
Graphics: 5/5 - Beautiful.
Length: 5/5 - As long as you want to. Played it for 30 hours and was still on the start of the game.
Replay Value: 2/5 - There's no real reason to start over again since you'll repeat everything just with other characters on your island.
Enjoyment: 1/5 - It just got frustrating the more I played.

Overall rating: 25/40 => 6.25/10 => 6/10"
piscesperiod,"Oct 13, 2020",8,"I particularly enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of this game. It's truly unique. You do things in your own time, at your own pace. Animal Crossing is also a neat reminder that everything takes time, in a day and age where we've grown to be accustomed to unrealistic speed and high expectations.

I've been playing for a couple months now, and I'm enjoying it a lot. Bounding with the villagers is really cool, customising your island and character and seeing how the flowers bloom, bridges are built and seasons pass is more entertaining than I thought it would be.

The downsides I'd say are how you can never choose quantity of items, you always have to buy and sell one by one (notable exception of flowers and shrubs, which you can buy in bulks). Also having to first craft a flimsy tool to only then be able to craft the normal one (crafting the tool directly would have been appreciated)."
mischak,"Oct 10, 2020",10,"Ok, Nintendo only allows one island per switch, as outlined in all negative reviews, but this is really the best game ever! I now own 3 switches and 3 copies of the game to have my whole family visit each other. It is so nice to have all little chores without violence and stress. No in-app-purchases too. All money is just ‘earned’ in the game. There are so many things to build, so many to animals to collect. It is really genius that Redd sells genuine and fake art. It will teach children to look close at art and notice details. There is just too much to do. This game justifies buying another switch and game copy!"
Exp0zur3,"Oct 10, 2020",0,"Don't get me wrong this is amazing, but that's only if no one else is playing ANCH on your Nintendo Switch.

Lhant,"Oct 6, 2020",4,"To put it simply, this series thrives more than any other I know of on its long term appeal. Traditionally the series has done this primarily by filling the game with such an abundance of content that you can play for years and still be surprised and see new things occasionally. This particular game in the series has FAR less content to support its long term appeal than ANY other game in the series long history, despite the fact that the majority of the features it does have are not even new.

Yes, they are releasing free content updates occasionally. But at the rate they are going with these updates, it would take many many years to even catch up to this games predecessor in terms of content (AC: New Leaf, 3DS), let alone surpass it.

This game has made a number of improvements to the formula, but it's severe lack of content kills it for me. It takes quite a few hours of playing for you to really notice how much less this game has, but once you really get a feel for that it is hard for me to still give this game any praise. I have very little hope that Nintendo is every going to fully correct this unless they seriously step up their game with the updates."
Watergolem,"Oct 4, 2020",9,"It's a wonderful game each space is magnificent and the stuff is incredible, but is true, the restrictions about made a new island is sad, if I have enough with one switch, I'm not planning buy another one to have the opportunity of build a new island"

honest_rev7,"Oct 1, 2020",1,"WARNING:

this game makes you suffer psychosomatic disorders.

it starts gradually, and then it gets worse, and worse and worse.

which is why 1) people get testy and argue with their bf/gf/wife/hubby/siblings

which is why 2) people have to take a break from the game. because when playing this loop, they are reportedly much more mentally fragile, get triggered easily, suffer bouts of mania, and have mental breakdowns

3) which is why people hit plateu here after that initial high. it's addictive but not in a fun game sorta way, but like addiction proper. nook miles become external goals that prevent your brain from ever ""finishing"" aka getting some rest.

don't let this game ruin your life. it's not cute, it's a dreadful game that wreaks havoc on your mental health once you see it for what it is."

dartimos,"Sep 22, 2020",0,"I've specifically made an account on MetaCritic to warn people off from this game.

There is a feature in the game called ""Primary Player."" This player is the only one who is able to make progress in the game.  There is no way to make another island for other players.  There is no way to transfer power outside deleting the island and restarting.

If you are buying this for a family, don't.

Let's talk about dysfunctional relationships.  They are often caused by unilateral decisions and lack of communication.

The decision to have a primary player is a unilateral decision by the developers despite complaints. It leads to unilateral decisions by the primary player placing their wants and needs over the ""secondary"" players.

There is no warning for this.  There is no documentation of this.  The only way you find are are reviews and comments online.  In other words, no communication.  Not only that, but it creates a communication inequality within the family.  The ""lead"" player makes the decisions.  They can listen to other players, but they don't need to.  The other players can suggest ideas, but there's no way to delegate or enable other players.

The game both practices and fosters dysfunctional relationships.  Both between designer and player as well as within the family.

I gave it a zero because my family cannot play the game.  I bought it for my family.  It is worth zero to me.  If they fix it, or you play it solo, I'd probably give it an 8-10 dependent on later content that I was unable to reach due to the Primary Player bug."

justArando,"Sep 18, 2020",0,"It suffers from a severe lack of innovation. It uses a the same formula from previous Animal Crossing but extremely watered down. The villagers are still cookie cutter NPCs that have little difference between each other in their respective personality groups. It was good that they brought new features like landscaping and outdoor decoration, but those features highlight the emphasis by the developers to make things look good rather than have actual value."

Daponted,"Sep 13, 2020",10,"Very fun and addictive, also very fun to play with friends and family. The  thing that makes the game so great is how you can finally customize and that is great to express yourself in ways you couldn't in other past games, plus the graphics are great."
GeeBoi11,"Sep 13, 2020",9,"I hate to love it.

The good:
- the Animal Crossing gameplay loop remains as addictive as ever
- can now fully customise your island
- crafting feels like a very natural addition
- great presentation

The bad:
- some major quality of life updates are still needed
- annoying one island per system rule"
KeroKero,"Sep 13, 2020",10,"This game got my family through the scary, bleak Covid lockdown and wildfires this year, and brought us all closer together. It’s part of our daily routine now, and a little bright spot on even the darkest days."
djplanetb,"Sep 12, 2020",5,"Look, this is a very cute and diverting game. I got it when it came out even though I had never played another AC game before, though I have put many hours into **** Valley so I thought it would be a good fit. Then the pandemic came and I got into it especially at the beginning. Didn't even time travel until late May or so. I've bred all the varieties of flowers, collected all the fossils in the museum and just finished getting all the artwork too (I'm not some **** that's going to not TT and wait 3 frigging years of real life to get all the art), terraformed my island several times over, so it's not like I don't appreciate what is in the game. The problem is the seeming hatred Nintendo's programmers have for the players of this game. Talking to Gulliver or Gullivarr, you literally have to hit the A button almost 20 times to get through the dialogues to get your task from them. This is similar for interactions with EVERY NPC that isn't an island villager. Why does Kicks even come to islands? He never sells anything worth having and that's just one more day until you can get some useful like Redd on the island. Crafting DIYs is a pain. I gave up crafing bait probably back in July, once I had caught all the fish available to that point. IF I ever pick up the game again (and it's less likely every day), I will never craft bait again OR terraform again. Terraforming is one island pixel/cell at a time. Like everything in this game, it is beyond tedious. This isn't so much a game as a part-time job and about as enjoyable after the shine wears off. I'm to the point where I cringe every time I hear the Isabelle music when starting up the game, then close my eyes and hit the A button until she's done saying nothing... again.

Back to the villagers... so boring. It's like you're supposed to talk to them every day, but when you do 9 times out of 10 they say the EXACT same thing they said yesterday. Reading online about how the villagers have been dumbed down and made nicer since the earlier games makes it seem like a really poor choice. When you get to the late game - having plenty of bells in your account and upgrading the house and shops to the max, and having the villagers you want - there's NO reason to go to other islands with Nook Miles Tickets. I now have about 150,000 NMs and NOTHING to spend them on. And I have a few achievements left to earn more but they are grindy AF and it would take me another 100 or 200 hours to get them (I'm ashamed to say I've played this over 500 hours, but I blame that on the pandemic). Not interested.

To sum up: It's a pretty game with no soul and in the end, will bore the cr*p out of you."
Para_,"Sep 11, 2020",5,"This game is the most disappointed i've ever been with a game I was hyped for. The first 2 months was a great time. It was fun filling out my fossil, bug, and fish collection, and trying to rank up my island. I hit 5 stars, got my fossil collection to 100%, got my house to max rank, and slowly lost my will to play. There is nothing else to do. The landscaping tools are too slow and cumbersome to incite me to redesign my island. Catching new bugs and fish stops being exciting. I have 10,000,000 bells from how easy and exploitable the Stalk Market is. You and other people can't modify an island while hosting, leading all multiplayer sessions to devolve into you becoming a tour guide for 10 minutes. The animal dialogue is repetitive and boring. Nook Miles stop being an incentive to do anything later on due to the absurdly grindy goals you have to do.
The core gameplay loop stops being fun after a month, and makes me regret spending $60 on the game. Nobody I know that picked the game up at launch still consistently plays, and ive heard countless people say the same thing online. They're trying to add new content, but it's far too little, too late and I couldn't be bothered. Whenever I turn the game on, I play for less than 10 minutes, and go play something else. I want to love this game so bad after playing New Leaf daily for *years* but I just can't. Its a rushed, boring mess that has no right to be in the same prestigious series as Animal Crossing.
If you want to play an Animal Crossing game, you're better off playing New Leaf or Gamecube. This is not worth your time or money. The game is beyond saving with seasonal updates. The core gameplay loop is not fun. I am a long time fan that only wants the best from the series, and New Horizons isn't it."
flatpup,"Sep 10, 2020",4,"First of all, the user score here is very unreliable as it appears the same person has made a ton of accounts to complain about the way Multiplayer functions and you can tell it's the same person because every account has only one review and it's for Animal Crossing New Horizons.

With that being said, the game has some serious issues. It is severely dumbed down from New Leaf to a very disappointing degree. There are less fish to catch, less bugs, Museum is smaller, less shops, less shop upgrades, less furniture, less clothes and less house upgrades. All of these have been changed in favor of a crafting system that is painfully shallow and does not at all make up for the lost content. Nintendo is adding content over time but it's at a painfully slow rate and what is being added is not even close to what this game needs to be as good as New Leaf. If you are deciding whether to buy this game and haven't played New Leaf then you should just buy New Leaf instead."

TEMP0,"Sep 6, 2020",7,"I gave this game a 10 score for being a refined island getaway, but I need to take that back. Honestly once you get a 5-star island, a 6 room house, all your favorite villagers in your island, and do a couple of big events, then New Horizons starts to get old. You notice the flaws within the game; it's limited in its features, the graphics & camera angles can feel clunky at times, and it's not even complete yet."
Moobusman,"Sep 4, 2020",4,"This game was incredibly hyped up and I was so excited for its release that I pre ordered the game. I’m so dissatisfied with this game. Animal Crossing is a series with so much charm and quirkiness and this game has destroyed that. Also there is a lack of content, I always am doing the same things everyday. When I played/play New Leaf I feel like there’s always SOMETHING I can do to have fun. I’m really hoping these updates they’ve promised for 3 years make the game enjoyable, but for now I can’t play this god awful game!"

From the wild world, to new leaf and now to this. Witnessing the improvements was just nostalgic. To be able to terraform and design your island is so amazing. Amazing game for quarantine days. This is a chill game so to fully appreciate everything is not to play fast like timetravelling. You don’t need to beat anything. That’s why even if the updates are slow, I love how they drop it one a time so as not to get bored easily. Live the life as an islander/villager. Though I’m still waiting for my favorite barista, Brewster. Giving it an 8 coz New Leaf’s Tortimer island visiting, Retail store and kicks shop were still my fav. And I’ve got to be the mayor then."

The game should be a $20 USD title at best given how repetitive and empty the ""gameplay"" is. I couldn't tolerate it for more than 5-10 hours and is, easily, one of my biggest regrets on the Switch. Too bad I bought a digital copy, otherwise I would've traded it a few days after buying it. Can't recommend this to anyone unless you're a fan of burning money."

Kickingtheplace,"Aug 26, 2020",5,"Update Review:
After buying this same since launch, I honestly thought the newest Animal Crossing game would be better than it's predecessors. However, New Horizons fails to impress after completing the various set of objectives. The updates may have addressed the issues we wanted but the one Island system still exists while we rarely see new things being added. These updates only added special temporary events which did not give me an incentive to go back. Unfortunately, this game is lacking variety compared to New Leaf and City Folk. I feel like this game isn't living up to the hype especially to people who have devoted their lives to the franchise. I hardly hate to say this but this game is honestly a bargain bin to me."
Ridleymain,"Aug 25, 2020",5,"On one hand, I actually like the durability system and the fact that you can craft so many different things, and also the game will always be relaxing and relatively stress-free. On the other hand, the characters are incredibly dry, you can only have one island per console, and for me, the game gets stale after about a week. Also pretty much everything is locked behind a time wall. I don't think it's a bad game, and definitely recommend this to anyone who has not played an animal crossing game before, but it is nothing compared to New Leaf."
CurlyLox2047,"Aug 25, 2020",0,"This game is horrible. I have to force myself to play it to justify the $60 spent. It was a gift and I feel guilty not playing it knowing someone spent their hard earned money on it. But it is really bad, it’s like torture, every time I think of the game I get a headache. I can’t believe someone created a game that is not fun at all. You have to break rocks and do chores on this island like you’re a prisoner. I hate it! Just imagine if they made it like Minecraft and you were able to build cute things not made of squares, this would be fun. But this game is so boring!!!"
glittergoose,"Aug 24, 2020",7,"Initially, I could not put down this game. I spent two weeks after getting a ""4-star"" island rating trying to raise it to 5 but... I hate it now. I hate the way my island looks and feels. I look to other player's 5-star islands and it is not my jam. I've ruined so much of the natural beauty of my secluded island to please Isabelle, but she's never satisfied. Can't even start a fresh island without deleting all my progress. Do I really want to back to a time when I only had one outfit?"

Mjcarrillo96,"Aug 23, 2020",9,"Probably the most relaxing game I've ever played and was the biggest comfort I've had during quarantine. For the first three months, I literally could not put it down. I love the amount of customization avaliable and how you and your friends' islands and residents will always be wholely unique.

After six months of playing on my 5-star island, I do have to admit I've run out of things to do. I only log in once in a while to fill out my catalogue, say hello to my favorite neighbors, or the occasional new idea project that arises. I do really admire how Nintendo puts out monthly updates to keep you interested, though I haven't really found any of them to be super substantial besides the swimming update. I would've liked more quality-of-life improvements to make crafting and decorating more seamless, or even some multiplayer additions. It's always fun to visit my friends' islands and vice versa, though visiting is really the only extent as you can't build or play games together. My time with the game now is more pleasant than it is life-drainingly engaging. But it's hardly something I can really fault the game for, because I put over 170 hours into it! Most games I can't even break 30 hours before I'm tired of it.

I know I'll never be done with it, even if I don't play it as much now. And I know, I'll be eating up any new Animal Crossing games should they ever make another. For now, I'll keep holding out for a multiple islands update or some multiplayer minigames."

Just some thing interesting not just island and islands and animals  to bring. i also don't want put every retail i meet in my **** you can't kick villager which is annoying, and there villagers don't have any personality , no dislikes,  no unique dialog , and no unique rooms. except the five special characters and people are wondering why people wanted that cat so much because he hes unique"
Ryno_III,"Aug 21, 2020",8,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a good game, but I would be amiss to discuss the issues. The game has received a lot of hate for it and that's why the User score is so poor. So how do I feel about this game?

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a fun game that you can spend over a hundred of hours in the game. There's so much variety and there's a lot to do. There are a lot of items to collect and a lot to customize your island. There's a huge cast of characters each with their own personality. It's also nice to visit a bunch of other islands. There's so many insects, fish, fossils, and paintings to collect and it's a nice and calm game to play.

The problems? The game is very slow (I'll explain) and plagued by a lot of bizarre problems that is dumbfounding that Nintendo refuses to fix. So let's discuss each one.

1. The local multiplayer. It's effectively useless. You'll need to create a new profile on another user on the Switch. Once you got the other player... they can't do anything useful. You'll essentially just follow the designated leader and you can use tools. How fun.

2. The game is ""slow"". No text speed options and every time you talk with someone, there is a lot of repeated and useless text. It results in button mashing to skip the same dialogue. It's a time waster. This is true for a lot of things in this game... it's not a game breaker.. but it's certainly a bit annoying.

3. One island per switch. The first player to open the game will become the main account. If you share a switch and have multiple playing the same game, stay away from this game. The main account is the only account that will allow the game to progress in a meaningful way.  If you want to switch who is the main account, you'll have to reset the game and clear all data. Seriously? But why?

All negative things aside, it's a nice game. If you're a true gamer, I don't see this necessarily being a game for you. It's a family friendly game perfect for kids, girlfriends, non-gamers, and adults that aren't big on games. If you want to share the game with someone, don't.... You'll need a switch per person and a copy of the game per person. AC:NW is a nice game. They are updating the game with free updates and I still have a bit of fun playing it a 1-2 hours per day. It's far from perfect, but the game offers a bit of fun."

frogofdeath2,"Aug 18, 2020",10,"As someone who doesn't share an island with anyone, I love this game. Cannot stop playing. While the game is being bombarded with 0 star reviews for the one island per console, which is stupid I agree, but apparently they had something similar in New Leaf, and that doesn't get bombarded. Why? I guess it's because that was less of a shared console, and it wasn't quarantine. Or maybe people darling New Leaf because it's nostalgic for them. So I find the criticism really unfair. I play it every day, and I've grown so attached. I love decorating the island, hanging out with my villagers, and just soaking in the atmosphere. I've played for 250 hours and I'm still not in any way bored with it, and don't see myself stopping any time soon, as I haven't nearly done all there is to do. I haven't gotten a 5 star island and I haven't completed the museum. Routine is cool and all, but every day feels like a new adventure to me, not to mention the upcoming updates, which I'm really excited for. This game is one of the few things where I trust the critic score over the user score. Highly recommended."

My own fault for not doing enough research (one I wont make again in the future). If I would have known about this before making my purchase I would have chosen not to buy this game.
Aaro_n,"Aug 13, 2020",10,This is a best game ever that I see. You can do all what you think.  And I Don't know why everyone. Hates this game
ace_pilotson,"Aug 12, 2020",3,"Here is a breakdown for you:

- Previous features and characters have been removed.
- Islands feel small and crammed.
- Content is limited and drip-fed.
- Crafting and customizing are tedious chores.
- Tools break way too easily, and having to craft twice to build one tool is a pain in the a***.
- Travelling becomes pointless after a couple of trips.
- Terraforming gets old quick.
- UI is irritating and everything takes too many button presses. Menu and dialog mechanics from the 1990s are not fun in 2020, Nintendo.
- Background music is repetitive.
- Interacting with villagers is repetitive.
- Local multiplayer is practically a scam.
- Online multiplayer is basically a middle finger to people with no friends that play the game. Matchmaking? Why bother developing such a feature when you can send people to Facebook to watch some ads.

Sure, graphics look great and the first few hours of gameplay are entertaining but if you scratch past the surface it is not a very good game."
Luahanseng,"Aug 12, 2020",5,"Great graphics, great concept, tons of random items you can acquire and addictive specially the creativity part. The negatives though, i hate that they limit bunch of things, they basically limit the capability of the switch,"
Bashbach1,"Aug 11, 2020",4,Only buy this if you are willing to put at least 5 to 10 hours into LEARNING how to do anything in the game. This is not a game for everyone and it gets really old after doing the same thing for weeks on end. I would suggest borrowing a copy form a friend after they get bored.
BoroBoro,"Aug 11, 2020",0,"My sister bought a switch and the game, we both want to play it and have our own islands. We can’t afford to buy A WHOLE OTHER SWITCH!!! This is a dumb moneygrab it’s obvious, make multiple save files to the game and update it! One person will have fun on the game while the other one is left with nothing to do but collect sticks (no decision making whatsoever). If you have multiple kids and don’t want to here them fight and whine over not getting to actually have fun in the game, don’t get it! I am extremely disappointed with Nintendo, the game is great but useless for those who are not the island owner!JUST ADD MULTIPLE SAVE FILES!"
Link_the_garden,"Aug 11, 2020",10,Perfect game for the switch. This is my first animal crossing game and really enjoying it. Charm!
ruben1100,"Aug 10, 2020",9,"A very good game, in which you can relax and play a bit every day. The only bad thing would be the late game, after so many hours you do not have so much to do and it gets monotonous.

About the limitation of only one island I don't think it interferes with the experience. Just enjoy the game ."
EvaCritic,"Aug 10, 2020",2,"My boyfriend was super excited for this game, and visiting each other's island. Today we got majorly disappointed...
Only 1 island available per system. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY TOGETHER. Not only can't you make an island of your own, but all the decisions on the island are made by, essentially, player 1. If Nintendo fixes this sh*'t, I'll reconsider, but otherwise it's a 2 out of 10 for us."
GabFire,"Aug 9, 2020",8,"Eu acho que os jornalistas enaltecem demais os jogos da Nintendo, esse aí não tem nada de ''LENDÁRIO'', Astral Chain é muito melhor. O jogo é bom e divertido, recomendo para quem não é brasileiro, pois a Nintendo não se importa com o Brasil. :)"
Aspalber,"Aug 9, 2020",0,El hecho de que halla limitaciones en la isla con respecto al primer usuario no permite disfrutar a varios usuarios del juego y trata a todos los que no lo hallan iniciado como invitados en el juego que solo tienen disponible una demo del juego aún teniendolo
ExoticHm,"Aug 9, 2020",0,"Bought this game for the promising coop experience for me and my GF. Turns out the first registered player in the game is only able go do progress on the ‘’main storyline’’. GF lost interest in the game as the main player, and I did not...  So im stuck playing 2 profiles. How about a detailed warning about this before starting making the profiles?????
And the coop experice is a joke only 1 player can really do anything, other players are limited to using tools and thats it, gets boring so fast....
I do not understand why is a good idea? Not even an option to make someone admin. No fun allowed. If you like solo play this game is for you, but find something els if you enjoy coop. The bad rating is due to the game being a huge letdown for me, would never spend this money if I knew those things."
E-K,"Aug 8, 2020",0,"Thank you for the drama and deception with my kids, nintendo. One island per console? What kind of stupid decision is that? This is ridiculous!"
Ginam83,"Aug 8, 2020",10,Fun and their so much to do. Being building my island for months and still do not get tired of it.
Ultramarin9,"Aug 6, 2020",9,It is my first AC game and I love it. I also like that you get the updates for free. :3 Nintendo was lucky to release this charming game during a pandemic ;')
Spaghettichaek,"Aug 6, 2020",5,"I’ve never played an AC game before. I love life-sim games. This AC reminds me of the Sims, but if the Sims bred with Minecraft and made a game with a terrible UI and a slight superiority complex through the stupid real time method- you MUST wait 24 hours to build this museum, HA. HA.

It has four main facets of gameplay. Resource grinding, hunting, customisation/crafting and multiplayer. I‘ll go through these.

1. Resources

Grinding for resources, which you have to do with constantly breaking tools, is painful and will lead to mild insanity early in the game. You need wood? Hit that tree. You need stone? Hit that rock. Never-ending. Also, there aren’t enough resources on your island, so you have to fly to other ones created for resource grinding- this costs a stupid amount of in-game currency.

2. ‘Hunting’.
You can catch bugs, fish, sea creatures and dig up fossils, all of which you give to the museum. This is fun enough and relatively interesting.

3. Customisation.

You start on a deserted island. By the third realtime day if you’ve played quite a lot you’ll get some cool furniture to craft. By the 9th or 10th you’ll get terraforming. The customisation options are relatively wide ranging once you acquire them- but the time it takes is stupid and irritating. However, you can immediately design clothing, which is pretty awesome.

Placing furniture, however, is one of the most frustrating things- without a useful placing system you just have to drop it and hope it lands in the right place. Sometimes, even when there’s loads of room, the game says ‘no room to place things here’- one of the many irritating unskippable dialogue boxes. Also, moving things like trees is irritating- you have to eat. One. Apple. At. A. Time. Dig the tree up. Plant it. Making a forest is difficult to say the least.

4. Multiplayer.

If you have Nintendo Online, for 4 dollars a month you can visit other’s islands with full chat facilities (beware if your kid is young and you don’t want them talking to strangers). This is good, because you can see people’ efforts to customise their islands and hang out with them.

So, in conclusion- this game is both fun (because of the customisation options) and deeply frustrating. For a game based on creating a desert island in your own way, it takes a ridiculous amount of time to unlock customisation options and there’s much, much too much grinding. Time travel is necessary to avoid deep boredom.

Buy it if you like life sims and aren’t bothered by grinding for resources."
HKolomar,"Aug 6, 2020",8,its great initailly then you get bored of it and never touch it again. so worth the price tho! i  put in around 100 hours in that game so quick!
Proff8,"Aug 5, 2020",0,"Me dan arcadas llerof, si la saga ya es mala de por sí, este juego es vomitivo"
XborgWife,"Aug 4, 2020",3,"I really loved Animal Crossing New Leaf and I thought this game would introduce new things, but I was wrong. And they really downgraded on the fun factor. No new personality types, dead villagers who only mention the HHA score and fossils. They might as well all be the same personality type. Graphics aren't everything and this game is given way too much credit for what it is. Boring."
mario1892,"Aug 4, 2020",3,"Not a game for me, really boring, I hated the thing you can only have one island, but maybe it´s cool for anyone else..."
Uvataruga,"Aug 4, 2020",10,The best of the existing Animal Crossing games with a beautiful glow up and amazing details. Lovers of the saga will appreciate it more.
FinalCookie,"Aug 4, 2020",0,"I bought this game for me and my girlfriend to share, but it became clear right away that it was unplayable for Player 2. No involvement with progression, can't help upgrade the island, doesn't get Diy recipes, and the other villagers don't even interact with her as much as me. With how a 2nd copy of the game won't allow for another island like with previous titles it's obvious that Nintendo just wants us to buy a 2nd switch. The biggest cash grab I've seen from Nintendo since Mario Cart Tour."
bookishowl26,"Aug 4, 2020",0,Nintendo tricked my family into getting this game. I thought it would be fun but you can only have one island per switch. My sister opened the game first so she gets to be the mayor and I don’t get to make decisions or do anything interesting. The only way to fully enjoy this game as a multi person household is to buy another switch. Of course nobody is going to do that. I was super disappointed and I thought that the game would be fun. Nintendo please fix this the fans need you to.
enlin,"Aug 4, 2020",0,It’s so idiotic that you can only have one island per console. We can only afford one console for our family and many people would like to enjoy the game to the fullest.

ShaddowMaann,"Aug 3, 2020",6,To me the game is pretty good I don't have to deal with the whole 2 player thing I do enjoy the game but it gets boring after awhile doing the same stuff
300ops,"Aug 3, 2020",5,"i would give the game a ten out of ten but the crafting system doesn't allow for you to craft multiples of items that seem like they should have a multi craft (fishing bait), manilla clams don't stack even though they aren't furniture or a donateable creature to the museum, and 1 island per switch console as a person who has always bought either multiple copies or memory cards to play multiple towns this breaks my heart as a die hard animal crossing fan, scorpion spawn rate was nerfed too heavily to the point that catching multiple is almost annoying because theyll fall into water or theyre will be a water bug that you cant see in any of the views for the camera. if the game fixes these issues i would deffinitly give it a 10 /10."

davidb1080,"Aug 2, 2020",5,"At first I loved this game because it was addicting and relaxing but overtime the game became tedious and boring. Pros: -addictive -easy

-tedious -tons of inconveniences that shouldn’t be in the game —if you share a switch with someone you have to share an island with them"
Mavheit,"Aug 1, 2020",4,"Such a great game, ruined by a GROSSLY OUTDATED game structure. I understand that 1 island only is kind of a series staple, but this do not make it justifiable in this day and age. I bought the game in order to play it with my gf, and right now the game is nearly unplayable in local coop. I bought the game to let my sister create another island of her own, and this is straight up not possible. Such a good game ruined either by unjustifiable ignorance or unredeemable greed. Mah"
partypooper,"Aug 1, 2020",0,"Buying this game to play together ****, only one person gets an island. The second player barely get any rights and is not fun at all. very dissapointed in this choice by nintendo"
Chiraku,"Aug 1, 2020",10,"Beautiful game in which one can enjoy for hours whether playing alone or with friends, enjoying the environment the changes of weather and creatures that one can find and capture in addition to being able to decorate our island as we like, simply a beautiful and quiet game to pass the time."
Sanastusa,"Aug 1, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons - 2020 - Play Time: 370 hours (and going)

Start this off by saying this type of game is not for everyone. But for the ones who enjoy Animal Crossing or ""Slice of Life"" games, its a amazing game that came out when the world needed it most. Right at the start of the worldwide pandemic, ACNH released and allowed us to enjoy a virtual life while being forced to stay indoors.
A simple groundwork of starting off on a isolated paradise island; You are tasked by Tom Nook to help develop your island to a livable home that people will want to come visit and live at. Finding all sorts of villagers along the way to come move to your island. There is almost 400 different villagers you can find that range in personalities and looks. Try to be nice to the non kawaii ones. They have feelings too. Besides Shari.
A game that never really ""ends"" I was debating on when to write a review but I have achieved a 5 Star Rating Island and now have began to try and catalog all items in the game. There have been a couple updates and each one adds in something new to experience. This game is a enjoyable work of art that can easily be viewed as a stress relief. It also holds a special place for me as me and my girlfriend like to play it together and hold little special dates when we have the time.
Well done Nintendo."
Moretti3511,"Aug 1, 2020",10,"best game eveeeeeeeeeeeeer, I hope they win at the game awards, cause they deserve this."
Ganzganz,"Aug 1, 2020",1,Only one Island makes this game extremely awful for playing with several kids. Avoid it completely in case there are more than one person to play. My youngest daughter started with an island and the older is suffering since then. I have seriously thought to uninstall the game
blueviper17,"Jul 30, 2020",10,It's one of the best switch games I've ever played you can play hundreds of hours collecting fish and insects upgrading your Ireland playing with your friends unlocking new stuff it's addicting I never played Animal Crossing game before but I ride keeps on raining low while I got to seen cuz you only have one Island to f****** cares well I haven't played any other games but still it's still great game even if you get one Island if you have a problem with it being a real time based game you can just fast forward it with your system settings on your Nintendo switch they're going to keep on updating game and I saying Go the f*** Ford cuz you it's one of the best game I've ever played if grammar bad it's because I'm using the microphone and not typing and you can just play co-op which is you're going to have to get used to but the controls are very different and having one Island to be a problem if you have Nintendo switch online which is $19.99 a year  so but no ****  but still play this game I'd recommend Halle Berry dating Larry very addicting no wonder its of the tendo switches best sellers
Iheartbobross,"Jul 30, 2020",3,"One island per console is terrible when sharing with a whole family. Each person that signs in *should* be able to shake furniture out of trees and dig up their fossils each day even if all on the same island, but it’s not built like this. Does Nintendo update the game to allow this? No, no... they waste money and coding time on updating “Dream” visits to islands where you can’t actually do anything nor bring anything back. And you have to have a code to go to one to do nothing.
Wow. Thanks Nintendo. That’s... great?"
Arcan,"Jul 30, 2020",4,"The dialog takes to long, and it's for 60€ NOT the content that I expect. And wenn you want your favorite Villager yeah than buy some Animal Crossing Cards."
moose_stash,"Jul 30, 2020",9,"This is a game that is held back by the fact that it is essentially a beta with constant updates rolling out. I will say, I love animal crossing. I've been playing since the gamecube version and have always loved the charm of having a little town you can escape to. The anthropomorphic animals that become your friends is always welcome in my home and New Horizons delivers on the original concept better than ever before. I've heard critics call this iteration the ""Breath of the Wild"" of Animal Crossing. I can agree. Never before has there been this much customizability and control of your village. Let me start with some of the positives. First, let me talk about some quality of life improvements that aren't commonly talked about. Your villagers never leave in this game unless you prompt them to leave. This is amazing. Especially from the perspective of someone who likes to play the markets. There is an intrinsic value placed on certain villagers depending on how in-demand they are. In previous games, they would move out unprompted and there was nothing you could do to get them back short of buying their respective amiibo cards. Next, the crafting system is just wonderful and plays well in the new improved atmosphere of New Horizons. It adds a bit of whimsy and character to a series already chock full of the stuff. Now some negatives. As people can see by the review score, you're locked into one island per switch. Which isn't that crazy considering that has been the take of Animal Crossing historically. The biggest thing that knocks it down from being a perfect game for me is the fact that the content wasn't all there upon release. Animal crossing requires long-term dedication for hours a day (within the first few months of this game I have over 300+ hours on my save) and the game can start to feel a little stale by the time a new content update is released. While the charm and whimsy certainly make-up for this fact. There's too many triple-A releases coming out to justify the enormous dedication it takes to do everything you want in this game. All-in-all, it's an excellent experience and if you own a switch, this is a must-have."
Styles717,"Jul 29, 2020",4,"Eh its alright. Some really neat ideas have been implemented but it seems like the devs took the Todd Howard approach and left out way too many features from the previous games that made the series so beloved. Music is boring and uninspired. NPCs are one dimensional and lack personality. There also just isn't that much to do in the game. I can see why people new to Animal Crossing would think this game is great, and it is fun for a small amount of time. However, those who grew up with animal crossing may be disappointed with how far the game has strayed from the original concepts."

OzckarK,"Jul 28, 2020",9,"In my opinion this is one of the best games for Nintendo switch. There is so much to do, I have spent almost 300 hours in this game and I am still not bored. The only real problem I see with this game is that you can only have one island per console which is stupid. For me it is no problem since I am the only one using my switch but for people who share the same console I can see tis being a really big and annoying problem."
GameHunter,"Jul 27, 2020",3,"This is the most difficult game to score. I want to give it at 9 or a 10. But what Nintendo has done here is inexcusable, unnecessary, and unexplainable. If your Switch is yours and yours alone, then you won’t have the same issues I’ve been having. It really boils down to the one island per Switch decision they’ve implemented. Our island rep has lost interest in playing, so that leaves me with many hundreds of thousands of bells and Nook Miles with nothing to do but try to generate more and more to no end.
I loved the time I spent with this game. Now realizing that after all this time I spent, everything I’ve earned and unlocked along the way was truly for nothing. And it makes me angry. At this point it would be unfathomable to delete everyone’s save data and start over. I’ve come so far and done so much. I’ve got some rare items, crossbred many colours of flowers, unlocked just about every item currently available in Nooks **** now here I am. Faced with a decision I shouldn’t have to make.  Do I delete all this work and start **** do I just quit?
Nintendo has shown great disrespect to its customers with their one island decision. It may be the shadiest thing I’ve ever fallen for in terms of video games. I can’t believe they ruined it with this decision. I haven’t enjoyed a game this much in YEARS but...yeah they had to find a way to absolutely kill it for some reason.
Very disturbing decision by Nintendo and hopefully not a sign of things to come. It’s sad. It really is. Was it greed that prompted this decision? Idk, do they actually think people the world over would buy a second Switch so they could have their own island? That’s just not in cards for many people. Could I? Yeah probably, but that wouldn’t be very financially responsible for someone who has an actual life to live and maintain. What they’ve done here is within their rights, but I don’t understand it, and there’s no way around it. They got my money I guess and that’s good enough for them. How could you Nintendo?"
BellaYoko,"Jul 26, 2020",9,"Can’t stop playing this! Everything looks so cute! Only complaint is i want more islands, but overall, I’m still addicted to it and it’s really fun to play with my nieces and nephews!"
Macguy9,"Jul 26, 2020",0,"Recently, we purchased Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a reward for my son, who had saved up half of the cost with his allowance. He was excited to play the game, as my wife and I had played every previous version and had told him how much fun it was. We were all looking forward to playing the game and enjoying watching the island build up and grow. When the day arrived, he was the first to log in and play. My wife and I then created characters and started farming and building our homes. Then, the first major 'milestone' arrived. He started working on the quest, then went out for the day. I decided to log in to my account and help out with his quest. Imagine my surprise when I couldn't. Essentially, I was not the 'main' character, and not allowed to progress the main story line. I was disappointed, to say the least. Although I had put quite a number of hours into the game already and built up my home and character, and didn't want to lose that... I was consoled by the idea that I could always start another island and experience the main storyline that way. After all, the Switch has multiple user accounts, right? Wrong. Apparently I have to buy another game copy AND console if I want to experience the game I paid for in full. Or delete my son's island and start over, which I'm not about to do. This is an incredibly poor design choice on Nintendo’s part. Not allowing separate islands? Or allowing multiple players in a *multiplayer game* to have full access to the game features? Ridiculous. This may be the last Nintendo console I allow in my household. I will certainly be scrutinizing their software with independent reviewers very closely before allowing any future purchases in our household."
tacsman,"Jul 26, 2020",9,Endless fun!  I've put in over 300 hours since launch and don't see any end in sight.
cooterlooter123,"Jul 25, 2020",1,"This game looks pretty cool. My wife bought a Switch just for it. I wanted to give it a try and attempted to make my own Island but found that you can only have one Island per account, even with a different profile. I thought to myself, ""Wow this really ****, you have to buy another copy of the game if more than one person in the household wants to play. I'm glad I don't have kids."" Then i read that even if you buy another copy of the game, you would need to buy a 2nd Switch. That is greedy AF.

Now i remember why Nintendo 64 was the last Nintendo product I ever purchased, and will likely ever purchase in the future."
Maxington,"Jul 25, 2020",9,"The game is pretty amazing for a while. I played nothing but this game for a while after I bought it. But after about 70 hours (which I realize is a lot) I started to become bored. I'm currently taking a break and it should be better after the break. And yes, you can only have one island per SYSTEM. I'm sure that Nintendo did this so that more people would buy consoles. But that's just stupid. This my first Animal Crossing game and it's a blessing that I got it during quarantine. It has made my life better. Overall, if you've liked AC games in the past, like games like this, or think it looks fun, you should absolutely get it. It's worth the money"
Phishion,"Jul 25, 2020",9,"A large number of collection elements and beautiful islands with changing day and night, weather and seasons form the base of this game, and the behavioral design of the rich and varied animal villagers makes the player no longer lonely, greatly enhancing the player's sense of agency, sense of mission, and making the island full of life. The game gives players different goals in the short and medium term, as well as well-designed incentives of different levels and frequencies to ensure the player's attention. In addition, the game is designed with considerable restraint in terms of the resources given to the player, which ensures that the game is fresh for long periods of time, even in single player mode. All in all, this is a game that allows the player to self-actualize step by step, always making additions."
Dorichannel,"Jul 24, 2020",10,"This game is insanely addictive! I haven't played a game from this series since Gamecube, and yet I do not regret spending $60 on this not one bit! I passed on other games on eshop that were 10% off and 50% off for this **** it's worth it!"
jordanlearmonth,"Jul 24, 2020",8,"Animal Crossing. An international video game franchise that has impacted the lives of millions. The brand new follow up game has been released. I mean, when I went to go get my copy of this game, I waited in line for at least half an hour. But guess what? It was 110% worth it! I would have waited 2 hours in line if that meant I could wrap my hands around this mysterious wonder! It is such a peaceful, violence free, fantastic game that is great for anyone of any age. Today, I’m going to tell you how much **** game Animal Crossing: New Horizons is. Without further ado, let’s get right into it!

First, you need to know what Animal Crossing: New Horizons is all about. It starts off with you, buying the Deserted Island Getaway Package. You are dropped off at a completely deserted island along with a few other random villagers. What I mean by villagers is talking animals which each have completely different personalities! For example, Jitters, the green duck who can never get enough exercise. He even dreams about running thousands of miles a day without stopping. Or Bubbles, the hippo always wearing dresses who can never stop talking about becoming a pop star. The island starts out covered in weeds and is swarming with bugs. All you and your fellow islanders have are tents with radios but as you progress, your island does too. You and other villagers begin to live in houses which you can customize to the very last piece of furniture. A museum is forged which displays fossils, art, fish and bugs that you gather. A convenience store is built where you can sell almost anything for some extra cash. The tailor shop is made which sells the finest of clothing. A town hall is installed which provides all necessary help and information to make an island that suits you! Every time I show my mom this game, she falls asleep because of the beautiful songs that the birds sing and the image of a tree’s leaves getting rustled by the gusting wind,which leads me to my next point. The audio is so realistic and the visuals are calming, colorful and just a pleasure to glance at. This game is set with real time so when it’s dark out in real life, the shooting stars rain from the dark night sky in this never ending story.  Plus, you will never get bored! There are always things to do like do favors for villagers, make some paths or even expand your house! The amount of lively energy that was poured into this amazing creation is incredible! Islanders now send you mail, do yoga in front of the town hall, talk to each other about starting bands and even doing daily activities like fishing. Even for people who don’t like video games, you should give this beautiful piece of art a shot! I guarantee you will enjoy every last minute of it! Animal Crossing: New Horizons is truly a magical experience and almost whimsical."
jdax2,"Jul 24, 2020",4,"As someone who played New Leaf for the 3DS, the differences between the games are night and day. Where New Horizons took 2 steps forward it also takes 5 steps back when it comes to features and additions.
200 hours in, the new features (outdoor decor, terraforming, DIY’s) fail to make up for the countless features from previous games that don’t show up. Some missing features are furniture (1,764 in NL vs 804 in NH, less than half), the HHA Showcase, island mini games, some holidays (April Fools and Earth Day so far), Nintendo themed fortune cookie items, gyroids, the Cafe, fortune telling, and the dream suite are the most notable absences in the game. Features aside, many fan-favorite characters don’t make a return in the game: Kapp’n, the Resetti Brothers, Pete, Pelly, Phyllis, Tortimer, Digby, and Gracie Grace are ALL absent from the game.
This is not to say these characters and features won’t show up in one of many planned procedural updates, but the absence of all these features and characters becomes evident once the player accomplished many of the goals set by both the game and themselves. There isn’t much to do in the game after you achieve your 5-Star island. No more shop upgrades to look forward to for the time being, no more shops to open up, no more islands to visit, no mini games to play with your friends, no small distractions that were abundantly present in previous games.
The lack of content in Animal Crossing New Horizons and the presence of procedural updates is a sign of Nintendo’s complacency within the larger game industry. Halo MCC faced a similar lack of content compared to previous games when many of the game modes present in previous entries were unavailable on the release date. An entire year after the release of the game, all of the previous features have been added in. I fear this will be the fate of New Horizons. Whether for their own profit or to stave off time-travelers, Nintendo has chosen to give fans an IV-drip of new content into the game. It took over 2 months for diving to make a return to the game, a feature that was available in New Leaf upon release.
There has also been a noticeable decline in the quality of the features that do return. Characters like Isabelle have been relegated to repeating the same lines of dialogue every time you boot up the game: the same line about her missing sock or the comedian she watched on TV or one of the five other speech options she cycles through every week. Nook’s Cranny has only one upgrade as of July 2020, whereas NL had 4 upon release.
New Horizons does give players a much higher level of customizability than any previous game. Although the furniture options are severely limited, players can reshape the majority of the island to whatever they desire, they can place villager homes in any location they wish, and they can decorate areas outside of the player’s home. Creating custom clothing is given more versatility with more clothes types and now player designs are no longer pixelated, but rounded out when placed onto clothing items. Previously immovable objects such as rocks can be broken to be spawned in a more desirable area. The majority of fun from the game will come from the goals the player sets for themselves when playing the game, which is an issue if you struggle creatively. If you weren’t a super creative person, in previous games there were goals that could keep you playing day after day: additional store upgrades, building new stores, and playing off the more expensive debts for your larger house in NL. Even if you do enjoy being creative with your island, once you’ve achieved your 5-Star island, there isn’t anything major for you to work towards: no upgrades, no stores, and no upgrades for the small side rooms in your house.

Small features you would expect to be in any game are also missing. No options menu to change things like music volume, no ability to donate to other people’s museums, no giving fish or bugs to other players, and most egregiously, no way to have multiple islands on the same console. If you have a spouse or family member who also wants to start their own island, they can’t just hop on another profile, they can’t even just buy bother copy of the game, they have to buy an entirely new switch and another copy of the game. This makes the cost of having two save files in one household go up to at least US$280. In past games, all you had to do was either buy a new memory card on the GameCube or buy another copy of the game to have another village. Many other reviewers talk about this issue with the game and there really is no reason other than greed for Nintendo to make this change from previous games.

It feels like Animal Crossing New Horizons knew exactly what new features to bring to the game to please fans, but in bringing in the amazing new features, Nintendo failed to bring in so many of the fun, memorable, and important features and characters from the previous games."
Nevermber,"Jul 24, 2020",9,"How cool to be the only player on the console.
Well, if about the game - live, trade, build, fish, travel, catch bugs, pay a loan, pay a loan, pay a loan, rebuild the island. And you will find that you have only 3 stars out of 5.
The best life simulator for quarantined people."
Ricebuns,"Jul 24, 2020",8,"It's cute, engaging, and has daily short term + long term goals.  Yah, I guess having 1 island shared between two or more users is a downer, but no one has explored the idea to create an expansive island, with CRAZY HOMES.  If Nintendo could make 1 change, I'd request for villagers to have multi level homes that you could customize.  The game has reached a point, after 1-2 months, where you're limited to only the Island itself + your home, as the sandbox.  Giving control and additional creative freedom within villager homes would, imo, stay true to animal crossing whilst allowing players to appreciate their villagers more so, than simply gifting."

Niamhee56,"Jul 23, 2020",10,"Amazing game! Well worth the money and so much fun to play! The play style incorporates elements of all the games new and old from the series and the graphics are amazing! So many hours of gameplay to be had and so many creative ideas to explore!
The slow updates are exciting because you know there’s more content coming and it leaves you waiting and excited to play even more!"
effano,"Jul 23, 2020",1,"Found out today that there's a one island per switch limit... Didn't think to check for this before purchasing because it seems obvious that the system is capable of having at LEAST one island per account. I can tell by the vast number of reviews that mention this feature that I'm not the only person who made that assumption. Giving this one star because I still have hope that this could be a good game, but for now it's more like something I paid $60 to watch someone else enjoy."

Arainami,"Jul 22, 2020",0,"I really love this game, but it is impossible to play online with friends.  To get to the island of another player is only 1 case out of 100.  And a constant error is not only me - my friends also can not get to the islands of each other.  We all tried to set up our routers and read tips from nintendo (which are completely useless).  The online game doesn't really work."
Punk_n_Sass,"Jul 22, 2020",0,"Listen, I love this game and have sunk over 400 hours into it. It's my second most played game ever right behind Minecraft which I've owned for over 8 years. 400 hours in 4 months is a ton of time for me in a game.
However, I have reached a point where I'd love to have more islands to make more themed towns. I'm too attached to my first island to just kick all my villagers off and go searching for all penguins to make an ice themed island. But I can't use my creativity on more than just one island because there is only one island per Switch! I sincerely hope Nintendo patches the game so you can have at least up to 8 Islands on the console to match the number of accounts. Other games function in this manner where each account has a separate save file, why can't Animal Crossing?"
krasnyy_kedr,"Jul 22, 2020",8,"It's really fun and the reason I bought my Switch, but I feel it lacking since the 60th hour or so...

Fluffysgsj,"Jul 22, 2020",0,"One save game per switch is a **** move. **** is actually a complement tbh, I really feel this is not far off from the greediest moves some game companies (lookong ar you EA) make."
malicousness,"Jul 22, 2020",5,"First off, the game is beautiful and I haven't experienced any glitches since launch. It's fun and the new details are very cute and a big upgrade since the last games. The ability to customize your island is so cool and it gives your island a sense of uniqueness. There is a lot more customization that you were only able to dream about in the previous games....
However, what forces me to give this game a 5/10 is the fact that it is not finished. Right now, we are at a stand still in the game. If you have ran out of ideas on how to decorate the island, then there is nothing else for you to do. There is no additional store upgrades, no Roost, Dream Suite, or anything else that we use to have in previous games. We are essentially stuck in the early phases of the game until Nintendo decides to give us an update.
Also, the use of updates is a cop out for Nintendo to sell us a full priced game that is NOT FINISHED. There is also very limited villager interactions as well. In pocket camp, the villagers actually use the furniture that you have set up. They actually use the half pipe, Ferris wheel, etc, where as all they do is sit down on the chairs or benches in ACNH. That is very frustrating when I have spent days decorating a carnival, a wedding venue, a dinner, and a library and they don't even use them.
This game can be fun, however it is not finished. It is different from the animal crossing that I have known and loved because it has turned into more of a decorating game. Especially since there are currently no further advances in the game (store upgrades/ additional stores), so you pretty much reach the ""end"" like you would when you have played after 5 years and have nothing else to do. I really want to love this game, but playing it makes me really want to just pull out my 3DS and play Wild World or New Leaf.
I say wait a few years to purchase until Nintendo gets it's stuff together and actually finish the game."
KeyboardCowboy,"Jul 22, 2020",10,"I'm surprised how low people rate this game.  I've put in more than 200 hours and had a great time playing.  This has been the perfect game for the lockdown in 2020.  Also playing with another person on the same console same island makes it even more fun.  If you put in 100+ hours in a game and had fun, that's at least a 9 out of 10 in my book.  The value is incredible."

But as soon as the epidemic subsided and there was an opportunity to meet friends, the game lost some of its appeal - communication with the inhabitants of the island.

All that remains of the game is endless customization. Some people like it, but I soon got bored."
Retrogamer961,"Jul 21, 2020",8,"This is my first animal crossing game , I can see why this series is so popular as it is mainly a life simulator where you build and run your own island with the aide of a cast of adorable and lovable characters. although the gameplay is very repetitive and mostly consists of finding fossils , fishing , crafting tools and furniture , running into characters and doing mini fetch quests , managing finances , that results in your island slowly expanding and getting better. Plus I’m sure more activities and content will be added in overtime. The graphics are good for a switch game and overall the game is very relaxing , charming and addictive. Just the experience needed for 2020. If your a casual fan or a hardcore there is something for you to enjoy. However the amount you get out of this game is limited to how much you enjoy the grind and repetitive gameplay or how creative you are as it offers a vast creation suit."
NoveyTP,"Jul 20, 2020",6,ONE ISLAND? SERIOUSLY? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ****
Alvz9,"Jul 20, 2020",10,"Es el primer juego que tengo el honor de probar en la saga. Mi primer Animal Crossing; y la verdad, no puedo creer la experiencia que he vivido durante estos meses. Un juego que propone un concepto sencillo, vivir el día a día, hacer cosas de rutina, pero que es profundamente adictivo y te llama a estar constantemente remodelando tu Isla, o tu casa, y preocupándote de tus vecinos. Además este juego tiene un significado nuevo en estos tiempos de cuarentena, donde el distanciamiento social nos quita la posibilidad de conectarnos con otros. De momento, el mejor juego de Switch del año."
Thegamer6789,"Jul 20, 2020",10,"This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all-time and this is my first game in the series. As a single-player game, the game is amazing. There are a few minor areas of improvement needed such as not being able to craft more than 1 item at a time, but those are very tiny problems. However, if you play Co-op this game probably might not be for you as Nintendo locks 1 island per device which is pretty stupid. So if you are gonna play this by yourself I 100% recommend it."

-This game appeals to more casual consumers, if you are not a casual consumer, buy **** valley, same exact premise and game play with 1/4 the cost, or at least before buying animal crossing check out **** valley.
-this game probably deserves a higher score but due to personal reasons i give it a 5 as my least favorite Nintendo game, not just because of the personal reasons but like 60% are because of that.

etkz,"Jul 20, 2020",8,"Nice and polished AnimalCrossing game. It misses some things that other animalcrossing had, but that's not a reason to give this game a 0.

Ignoring all previous animal crossing games, this game by itself will give you enough entertainment to make it a worth purchase. It gives you incentives to play it every day which keeps you coming back and play it, although after a month or so it starts to get repetitive.
Me and my wife spent ~140h on this game, and we like to share the same island so show/visit each other houses, give items, etc..

I think this game really lacks coop/multiplayer. So many times I wanted to play with someone and we end up facing each other doing emotes/reactions but chatting on discord/whatsapp.

Since the game managed to get me hooked for a couple months and made me talk about it with friends and wife, I think it deserves an 8."
Abuelita,"Jul 20, 2020",8,"Animal Crossing es una experiencia increíble que crece día a día. Nunca antes había jugado algo de la saga y tenía mis dudas porque no sabía cómo un jueguito así me podría divertir: no tiene metas reales sino las que te propongas tú qué básicamente es hacer tu isla y tu casa bonita. Pues resulta que es mágico, es un juego hermoso que te enamora cada día. Llevo más de 210 horas jugadas y sigo queriendo más. Cada actualización le da mas vida al juego y siempre hay cosas qué hacer, a pesar que ya hayas alcanzado las famosas 5 estrellas.

Los residentes de la isla son mis amigos y, de un tiempo acá, decidimos que íbamos a dejarlos ir cuando se quisieran ir, y es doloroso porque los voy a extrañar. El mundo que hay fuera que hacen los que juegan este juego es maravilloso y es que te contagia la buena vibra de alguna forma. Quieres ayudar a todos, ser amigos, conocer islas.

El apartado técnico está muy bien: los gráficos son súper bonitos, la música es un espectáculo, un gran 10, la jugabilidad está bien, adecuada para lo que se requiere. Luego está la lentitud del juego, pero creo que es parte de la experiencia.

El juego no es perfecto. Tiene errores muy puntuales  que los corregirían con tan poco, pero creo que no quieren corregirlo: 1ro: una sola isla para todos. Vamos que esto debería ser una opción y no una imposición, pero la verdad es que va con el rollo del juego de todo bonito y tal, de compartir, pero quita la experiencia al segundo jugador. 2do: el online es tan mediocre y fastidioso que uno se lo tiene que pensar antes de visitar a una isla o recibir visitas. “Alguien está llegando a tu isla”. En conclusión: un verdadero must. Pagué 46€ y los volvería a pagar y volvería a gastar 210 horas en hacer de mi isla un hogar."

Gts1991,"Jul 19, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing New Horizons  is one of the best  Animal Crossing  games, the Crafting mechanics/DIY system really add a lot of depth to the game, the possibities of turning a deserted Island into a bustling comunity add a tremedous level of customization to the game, the game have some flaws like the lack of Bulk Crafting and Durabity Meter to our Tools to show how long our Tools last, but with Nintendo  saying they gonna upgrade the game for 3 years, Nintendo  not only can fixes this isseus, but also add brand new mechanics  such as a Cooking mechanics  and the return of beloved character such as Brewster and the Roost  and Kapp'n  making this Animal Crossing  games the best franchise, Nintendo  just need to listen to our plees to add QOL improvement like Bulk Crafting and Durabity Meter to our Tools to show how long our Tools last and brand New Mechanic  such as the Cooking mechanics  when added in a future  update  will add a lot of  depth  and  shake the franchise  formula."

MrMarvell,"Jul 19, 2020",10,"I have played this game every single day since launch and every day it feels me with joy, I have never time travelled and I believe that's the best way to play, although each to their own. I have slowly but surely built my island from the ground up and it's so satisfying when good ideas come to the fore once you get certain tools and items. Honestly, I cant reccomend this game highly enough, especially with what's been going on in the world, it's really helped me out. I have some amazing villagers at the moment like Sherb, Marina, Beau, Aurora, Marshal and Stitches and their personalities and traits are a pleasure to be around.
I never thought I'd play any game every single day, but here I am and I think I'll be playing this game every single day until the n4xt game comes out it is incredible.

What a great game. It is a game that opened a new way for the game industry. It proved that games are fun enough without being provocative, violent, or sensational.

NeveSucks,"Jul 18, 2020",2,"I truly wish I could say I enjoyed this game. I played it as the first person on the console so I was able to get the full experience. I sunk 50 hours into it, but I’m sad to say I disliked almost all of that time.

It’s an easy game to get lost in, I’ll give it that, but after the first few tasks of the game when you are finally given free roam, it’s boring. Absolutely nothing compared to the refreshing experience that was New Leaf.

It may appeal to some, but personally, filling an island with objects that are unusable to achieve a 5 star rating is not what I expected from an Animal Crossing game. Dialogue with the characters on your island is short and lifeless. It’s tedious to get actual tasks out of them. Terraforming seems fun to begin with, but soon becomes a chore when trying to create the ‘perfect’ island. Furniture cannot be interacted with, so once something is placed, that’s the end of the fun. Filling the museum is enjoyable, but that’s the most action the game has. You’re basically turning your island into a museum anyway.

Travelling to randomly generated islands feels repetitive, and the only redeeming quality of them is finding a rare bug or a cute villager.  I expected something amazing compared to New Leaf (which is my favourite Animal Crossing game), but New Horizons fell short.

It’s truly only worth the money if world-building appeals to you. It’s a relaxing experience, but I expected more actual gameplay. I’m disappointed to say the least. It’s as lifeless as Amiibo Festival."
paolylo,"Jul 18, 2020",10,"10 because of how the game forces players to socialize on Discord, Facebook groups, or anywhere that offers chances to earn more bells, increase their catalog, or play around by collecting villagers while allowing introverts the option to grind away on crafting materials and collectibles. It really doesn't punish the impatient ones for changing the date and time on System Settings because everyone does it anyway. I couldn't ask for a better way to kill time on the Switch/Switch Lite."
Eimear,"Jul 18, 2020",0,Only having one island per console no matter how many copies are purchased is outrageous. It robs players of the full experience of the game as only one player has the full experience. This can cause arguments in families as to who is allowed to be that player. The Nintendo Switch and Animal Crossing: New Horizons are meant to be a family console and game. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is meant to allow players to create and design their own islands but this is not possible with only one save file. This just proves how greedy Nintendo is. It would be reasonable if it was an island per copy but it’s a cheap money tactic that Nintendo has included to rob fans of the game. No other game has this problem. If you want to play Super Mario Odyssey then you have your own save file for each account but Nintendo understands that Animal Crossing is a huge nostalgia game so they took advantage of it to try get more money.

Mossagon,"Jul 13, 2020",6,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is a overall solid game but I can’t really bring myself to say that I personally enjoy it. It has its place for people who can tolerate how slow the game is and its repetitive gameplay loop, but I don’t think that it suits me.
The general gameplay loop is slowly upgrading your island, catching creatures to submit to Blathers, visiting new smaller islands, and that’s where it about ends. I never have a great motivation to make my island look nice or to do anything for its inhabitants due to them often feeling robotic or one note caricatures such as this guy is strong, this girl is moody, and that’s their whole personality. It’s worthy to note that your islanders personality rarely play a part in your daily gameplay, the only islanders you interact with frequently (The shoo vendors) have set in stone personalities that don’t factor into anything. So all in all it makes villagers just feel like side attractions/decorations instead of a motivator to continue upgrading your island for you and its inhabitants. To make your island look great you need tons of bells, which turnips become the primary way to farm them later on, which I dislike since they feel so disconnected to actual gameplay. In terms of the other parts of the loop, catching creatures is admittedly tedious but rewarding so I don’t have much to say on that note. But one thing I think everyone can agree on is the major design oversights that honestly I don’t have any idea how they got past play-testing. Crafting one object at a time, a long drawn out arriving cutscene that despawns any creatures near you whenever someone arrives, and more just take a noticeable toll on my enjoyment due to bow frankly annoying they are in this type of game. This isn’t to say that there’s nothing good about this game, the amount of things you can collect, your customizability, multiplayer, and general aesthetic are all things to take into account. The character designs are adorable, and nothing about the game aside from those oversights really frustrates me, but it’s just not my cup of tea. If you’re into those games where you can collect tons of stuff, and are a fan of its slow pace and relaxed nature, I’d say it’s for you. My final rating is a 6/10 which in my terms is a game worth playing if it suits you well."

Never have I gotten bored of an Animal Crossing game within such a short amount of time, but once again Nintendo fails to innovate and gets away with it because it's Nintendo and they can do no wrong.

Sigue transmitiendo la sensación de tranquilidad y calma que ya existía en las anteriores entregas, las mecánicas principales se han mantenido como el uso de las herramientas ya existentes y se ha llegado a aumentar con instrumentos de mano y las ya famosas escalera de mano y pértiga.


Un punto a favor de este juego (que para otros será en contra) es la dosificación del contenido. Los viajantes en el tiempo seguramente sean los que han provocado esto, para no destripar todo el juego de un día para otro como se demostró que pasó en el 2º día de juego.


Este no es el juego más completo de la saga hasta el momento (yo considero que el más completo al día que se escribe esta review es el New Leaf por la gran cantidad de edificios que hay y sus funciones), pero sí es el más ambicioso, debido a la promesa de actualizaciones durante al menos los dos siguientes años y la adición de nuevas mecánicas nunca antes vistas en la saga.


Dicho todo esto, tras más de 300 horas jugadas puedo concluir que: este es el juego que más he disfrutado y sigo disfrutando en mi vida, y llegando a ser perfecto para este confinamiento que en España llevamos viviendo desde justo una semana antes del lanzamiento del juego. El mejor juego para encerrarse en casa sin ninguna duda."

Although it can be fun at times, the game limits the player from playing the way they want."
Ryijun,"Jul 11, 2020",10,"Absolutely do not understand the negativity on Metacritic around this game. People went completely mad in the process, as with the Last of Us 2. In Animal Crossing, you want to come back again and again. And you can't play much in one sitting. But that's the point. The desire and ultimate goal in the game is the same-to collect all the items, which are simply unthinkable huge number. And how you will achieve this and how quickly you will get bored is everyone's business. But this game must be played by everyone who has a Switch. Good graphics, nice character style, nice music (the first 30 hours, then the sound turns off:)), interesting opportunities to rebuild your own island, a lot of events, which are also linked to the online, the change of seasons and of course the time that corresponds to the real. Fishing, catching insects, mining, growing trees, settling residents in the form of various animals, collecting shells on the beach, swimming. It seems to be simple things, but how well it is organized. Separately, I would also like to mention online trading with real people. The same items accumulate a lot over time and they need to be put somewhere. Some things are a pity to throw away, so they can be safely sold, for an adequate amount of course. Go to Nookazon and everything will be. In General, even after 490 hours that have already been spent in the game, there is something to do. It is impossible to describe why this game is played, just try it."

MD_Hirako,"Jul 8, 2020",10,"Mi opinión personal siento que es la mejor entrega de la saga hasta la fecha, el diseño de la isla, de los personajes, las cosas que puedes hacer y estar horas y horas haciendo cosas sin quedarte un segundo tirado sin algo que hacer en la isla lo hace sin duda una maravilla para jugar en todo momento, me he divertido mucho con este juego y le he entregado muchas horas y no deja de fascinarme y de querer seguir viendo contenido nuevo, lo mejor es que Nintendo sigue dándole contenido adicional sin costo extra alguno, solo DLCs gratuitos, así que los que lo critican mal es solo porque son unos fan boys de sus respectivas marcas y unos cerrados de me te, Animal Crossing: New Horizons es lo mejor del ultimo tiempo y un gran candidato para ser un juego destacado del 2020."

flatworldsedge,"Jul 8, 2020",0,"I share my Switch with my 9 and 4 year old daughters.  We have different play styles and all want the ability to explore the island, shape it, name it and play as we each see fit.  Having only one island makes this a single person ever game and completely poisons it.  It paints Nintendo in a deeply cynical light and has wrecked an otherwise decent game."
SpaceCadet808,"Jul 7, 2020",0,Me and my sister bought this game together only to find we couldn’t both play the game on our own islands. My sister plays but since I’m not the island representative it’s really no fun playing as you can’t experience over half of the game. The game seemed promising but as long as only one person per Switch can play it gets a zero from me.
Jogas,"Jul 7, 2020",10,Increíble el entretenimiento que este te proporciona y la versatilidad de poder hacer cosas que en otras entregas no como nadar y ser tú mismo. La versatilidad de los vecinos y la emoción y paciencia de un largo y costoso trabajo lleno de retos
Pvtprice03,"Jul 7, 2020",2,The game is fun and full of things to do. However those things to do become repetitive when you are the second player. I am caught between going to my S.O. account and sending her money in order to really improve the island... especially because i can literally contribute nothing to the island itself other than fishing and catching bugs. Very disappointed in this game. I hope they come up with a way to fix it or im just gonna have to return it.

Patacrepe,"Jul 7, 2020",1,"Never have I been so disappointed by a Nintendo game. Short on cash, I had to choose between this and Pokemon, given the stellar reviews I gave it a go. I'm beating myself up over this. I just don't get the hype. It is NOT worth 60 bucks. It's a minuscule game, with very little to do, had I spent 20 bucks on it, I'd say I got my money's worth. But to think I could have got Pokemon for the same price!? I also don't get why time travel is a point of contention... Don't people get that the whole waiting game is just artificially bloating the experience by forcing you to grind, doing activities devoid of fun over and over again in the meantime. That's the kind of manoeuvres used in freemium  games on smartphones."

jcestradag,"Jul 6, 2020",10,". Me encanta como en esta versión todo puede ser modificado en menor o mayor grado por el jugador. El grado de personalización es muy alto, lo que resulte en muchas horas de juego. Los personajes, los dialogos, los diseños, la música, todo me ha parecido muy bonito.

Alesk,"Jul 6, 2020",0,"You need to buy 1 Nintendo swicht + 1 game per family member + 1 online sub to be able to each play the story. This game, and nintendo globally is a shame.
I'm done with nintendo, you will never have 1$ from me anymore."
mastergaming,"Jul 6, 2020",7,"In the end of the day, it's a fun game that you can spend long hours into and it's a good game to pass your time by.

Really liked the amount of things you can collect (e.g. furniture, fish, clothes, etc. )  and the level of customization you can have on your island, house, character and so on.  The fact that they keep updating the game with new content and events to bring more to the game is also a plus and it gives value to it. The sound and graphics are simple but fine for this kind of genre. The gameplay is good and easy to learn.

The one island per console was a really let down for sure, I bought this game not only for me but for my girlfriend too, and despite the fact that I already knew about this issue, I didn't think it would be as bad as it was. Has I played first I got to be the Citizen Representative and that removed a lot of gameplay, which includes assignments and objectives, from the second player. The multiplayer in the same console is also really weak, not giving many things to do to the player that is not in command.

In summary, as I said, I liked it, but after spending more than 20 hours into the game I kinda felt a little bored with the the concept and the fact that after some time you keep doing the same things all over again, and you lose the purpose to play. In the future with the new updates and new content that they keep adding I may feel tempted to give it another try and spend a few more hours into the game."
Kimichii,"Jul 5, 2020",8,"Animal Crossing New Horizons still has the charm of the old games. So many things that the developers have kept the same - with some minor changes.
I was really excited when the game came out and I played it for about one month straight. I know that this AC is mainly targeting new players, but all in all many things just are a little bit too easy.
I've filled the fossils in the museum after around 60 days of playing. When I think of Wild World and New Leaf, this felt way too quick. Also to pay your house and all other expenses to Tom Nook was really easy.
What I really like is the new interaction of the villagers, how they are not just simply walking around anymore, but do different kind of actions, they react to the environment and with each other. This is incredibly cute and makes them feel much more lively.
Even though the developers announce new updates and tried to slow the progress of the game down with the different waiting times for e.x. the museum, the excitement for this game burnt down rather quick.
Additionally, I am really bummed about the furniture. There is so much less than in New Leaf and so many sets were thrown out... resulting in always getting the same kind of furniture in Balloons, Trees, the Nook Cranny and so on. And this is kinda frustrating.
I personally think they did this so you visit other islands more often, but for me Animal Crossing is a game to relax and often I just want to play for myself.
Still, I am playing Animal Crossing almost daily, as I am excited for the visitors and now with the Summer Update, I love swimming around and collecting more sea life. But I am not playing as much anymore as I was used to. Often I just do the dailys like collecting miles or the DIY recipe (which never results in a new DIY) and that's it.

BTW: Everyone who hates on ""there is just one island"" has never played an Animal Crossing before - and it shows. They always just had one city for one game. That this wouldn't be different on the Switch was obvious. Just inform yourself correctly and don't blame the game for it."
Ciscocat,"Jul 5, 2020",8,"I've never played any Animal Crossing before, however New Horizons was a rewarding experience. From what I know of the previous instalments I think the building of your own town on this island is the best evolution possible. I enjoy the nooks and crannies of my island including the literal Nook's Cranny store, in which it's exciting to see what new items I can afford for my house. It's got a good sense of humour and it exudes positive vibes.

With the consensus that this is a fairly good game I must denote the sometimes baffling negatives:

-You can't have one island per user, only one per console. The 0's piling up on this website only serve to show how broken Metacritic's user system is. However it is really stupid. I don't think it's intentionally greedy, or if it's a storage thing, I think Nintendo was just stupidly paranoid about ""cheating"" but I can't think of anything off the top of my head that would totally undermine the game if they had an island per user.
-Menus and especially shopping menus, my god. They are not intuitive at all. I hate to compare it to another game but it doesn't have the quick interface of something like Minecraft. Also the lines of dialogue need to be way faster, I don't have all the time in the world to listen to Blathers.
-Digging, picking up stuff and landscaping can be absurdly frustrating. Again it's slow and imprecise to  hit things with your shovel, and don't get me started on how many times I've picked up the wrong object, or haven't been able to place something because it wasn't clear, or shaped the wrong cliff or river. I know it's not meant to be a platformer or action-adventure but I think avatars would benefit from a much more robust moveset, and an interface that's a lot more precise and doesn't take its sweet time.

With that out of the way, ACNH is fun, and I'm burnt out on it now but when the world gets closer to ending I'll come back to it and have a grand old time."
princessfurios,"Jul 5, 2020",5,"Посредственная ферма от Нинтендо по фулпрайсу равному Cyberpunk 2077 или The Last of Us Part II. Что она принесла миру кроме мемов? Абсолютно ничего. Пустышка, как и почти все, что производит эта компания."
ppk,"Jul 4, 2020",10,"Initially I didn't think I'd like this game and waited until July 2020 to start playing after my brother and nephew gave it high marks.  To me it sounded too much like Minecraft--an exercise in tedium.  Fortunately there is much more going on here, to me.  Already the game is quite addictive in that certain game mechanics ""reset"" at the start of a new day (such as harvesting and long-duration builds completing).  I've not yet visited another island as the cost is still a bit too high.  The synced world time is pretty interesting as well as certain things are available based on TOD--I've never played a game like this.  To think that there are seasonal elements is quite exciting--can't wait until Halloween!

So far, the cons are the highly irritating character voices that can't be muted; after the initial few minutes I was wishing I could just do away with it.  Cycling through the menus is rather tedius.

Overall, quite pleased with Nintendo."

I played it like 300 h and still finding cute details that you only notice if you look closely.

It's not fair that people bombed the score with 0s only because the ""one island per console"". Yes, that's a bad thing and I'm worried to lose my island if something happens to my switch because I can't backup online but... guys, this is a really good game.

Yes, some mechanics feels odd, like the airport, but still the game overall is really nice and 100% recommended."
Zeusbot48,"Jul 3, 2020",0,"Only one island per switch? Terrible design decision.  What possible reason could they have for having this arbitrary restriction besides forcing people to buy more switches if they want their own island.
Seems fairly on brand for Nintendo though."
Jodmache,"Jul 3, 2020",0,If you don’t want to share your island with the other profiles on your switch you’ll need to buy a new game and console. This game ****!
dcrabtree57,"Jul 3, 2020",0,One island per console is ridiculous. Cannot afford to buy multiple consoles just so everyone in the family can play the same game.
cmktiv,"Jul 3, 2020",3,"it is 2020. Multiplayer should be expansive and innovative, but it is boring af. You can only visit others' islands. You cannot cohabitate with anyone. I think you are forced to if you share one switch device, but you cannot live with someone who owns their own switch. This is r*t*rded. So stupid.

I cleaned up my island and did significant upgrades in three days. After that, and even during, there is little to do. There are lots of tiny goals to knock out, but to minuscule reward. Grinding towards more upgrades feels pointless because the game starts with little to do, then you get a few upgrades. Is there more to do now? No. More to buy, maybe, but no injection of more activities. Just more fishing and shaking trees. Grind for more upgrades. Is there more to do, now? Not really. You can spend an extra 30 seconds a day now digging up fossils. That all.

It's not really worth talking about. Or playing. Feels super lonely, and flying to others' islands to fish next to them doesn't make it better.

Really disappointing."
skyfenix_gamer,"Jul 3, 2020",10,"It's great for hanging out. If you're looking for a game where you accomplish certain goals and then your done, then probably you won't like Animal Crossing. This game is to enjoy the little details, relax and hang out. You can spend several hours just watching your villagers, fishing, building, decorating and re building your island without any defined goal"
EdwardG,"Jul 3, 2020",6,"Cute, but tedious and more of a long chore than an engaging game. That's the impression I've been left with after 40 hours with Animal Crossing, and I'm honestly surprised I lasted that long. Then again, it is designed to get you playing every day as you're drip fed progress whilst you do the same boring tasks every day like picking up stones one by one or fishing where you can't move your line after casting it without just casting it again altogether. There's a lot of quality of life improvements that could be made here that even fans of this game have to admit, like being able to craft multiple items at once, for example. There's a lot of repeat dialogue that gets annoying as well, and when you give Blathers a new fish, insect or fossil in the museum you have to click through the same bunch of stuff every time for every item you bring before he'll tell you an interesting fact about it.

I can see the appeal a game like this might have to some people, as it is an escape from the real world where everything is pretty chill and you can design your island as you please. I found it really stressful though, and I know that might seem weird to some people. But the daily grind got to me, slowly ticking off those menial tasks and stressing over how to decorate my home. That might sound silly but if you're not the most creative person or you fuss over the little things, you might get a little stressed too.

There are some things I liked. It's got a very cute aesthetic and the museum is a really nice way to show off all the things you've caught and found. There's a lot of freedom in what you wear, and how you design your island and house which is great for creatives.

I wish I could've loved this game like it's many fans do, but I found it boring and stressful. It's got the Nintendo polish you'd expect, but also some quirks about not being able to have islands linked to individual accounts instead of the console that many people have complained about. Overall, I'd have to score this game 6/10. I might check it out again some time down the line, as it is getting updated with new seasonal events but I doubt those would fix my personal issues with the game."

Still, I got a LOT of great slice-of-life gameplay. I had good times with friends online. I made my island exactly how I wanted it. (Though I only got 3 stars)

The annoying bits (the time to ""travel"", text repetition, DIY-ing multiple copies, limited storage space, etc.) are very annoying but the charms of the animals, the addiction of collecting, the beauty of the game and its buildings and biomes are all wonderful and I appreciate my time with it."
guitarmaniac004,"Jul 2, 2020",7,"So I've managed to rack up more than 170 hours in this game so far, making it my most played game of the year so far.

I also think one island per console is a huge annoyance but it's not worth giving the game a 0/100 (ya big babies)

I start off I only played a small amount of new leaf before this game so I was going into this game with little to no knowledge. So I'm no long time fan of the series or anything or the sort.

I guess I'll start off with the pros:

-This game is so damn peaceful.
-Despite the slow progress at the start of the game it never leaves you bored, it leaves you wanting more.
-The progression of your island is entirely up to you.
-The detail of the graphics, animations and lighting is absolutely gorgeous, a huge step forward from previous games.
- The ability to terraform is a big bonus (although it has its own issues).
- If you are a collector/achievement hunter (which I most definitely am), this game will give you plenty to work towards.

So with plenty to do and more to do than ever, what could go wrong... right??
Well a lot apparently.
The cons!!:

-While crafting is a huge step forward for the series, as well as all the benefits it gives. It is the single most tedious experience I have experienced in a long time. It is also the worst part of this game. Why do I have to craft one item at a time, and whyyyyyy does it take so long to craft that ONE item? I spent (and I counted) 7 minutes making
twenty fish bait.

-The tools have no durability bar so you can never tell when they're about to break.

- Of course one island per console is a massive pain in the ass. It's obviously used to get more people to buy their consoles and I guess it works. So great job Nintendo marketing team! (ya knobs).

-Terraforming can turn your island into a beautiful paradise, but it's going to be hell before you get there. It feels clunky to use. You will hit the wrong patch is dirt 9 times before hitting the right one. It's just an all round mess right now and needs a serious overhaul.

-While you can track your bugs and fish, you can't track the fossils you have donated, which was in the last game so I have no earthly idea why they removed it.

-Villagers personality types are far too similar to other villagers. I'm sick of hearing three separate villagers talk about ""the bugs in their floor"". There needs to be more diversity between each villager.

FINALLY, this is not giving nintendo flack for making a shoddy game, I think it's beautiful, addictive and a great way to blow off steam. So I'm just going to give some suggestions the game needs in the future.

-The ability to craft multiple items at a time.
-Manilla clams stacking.
-More buildings/shops to build from Tom Nook (Like the coffee shop, or disco).
-Tracking fossils
-An easier way to terraform
-The ability to boot a villager from your island instead of ignoring them for 2 months.
-Durability bars for tools
-Less frequent rain. My island is starting to look like a jungle.
-Less time it takes to go to another island, seriously I spent probably 3 minutes talking to orville.
-An auto-sort option for my inventory.

You'll see that 90% of these are just quality of life features. Which is exactly what the game needs. I don't care about a diving update if the game continues this way.

Well that rant is over. Hope nintendo read this stuff... they probably don't... BUT MAYBE THEY DO... nah they don't."

Zervantis,"Jul 1, 2020",0,"Bought this game with the intention of sharing with the wife. Let her have a go first and when I came to play it, had the horrible realisation that I was just a second character on her island.

As much as I tried to get into it, it was hard and felt like everything I did was pointless as she was already so far ahead and built most the stuff on the island. This needs to be fixed as it’s a major issue. I don’t know of any other game that has the issue and it’s just ridiculous for a £50 game."
DaintyRosee,"Jul 1, 2020",0,I love the animal crossing games so much but this one was a serious let down if you have to share a console. Let my daughter play first and now I can’t do anything. Really don’t want to spend another 200 for a switch just so I can play this game. They need to update a patch that lets you switch island reps or let us have different islands on the same console because this is really lame.
Hoonetic,"Jun 30, 2020",2,"Like everyone else, it’s annoyingly that since my son started the game, my wife and I can’t do anything because we’re just bystanders.  The 1 island limitation is also a major annoyance! Nintendo please change the limitations or fix it!"
MyaL,"Jun 30, 2020",0,"I literally made an account here just to review this game. (Your dream get away begins now) No it doesn't, It's not MY dream get away when I'm the second third fourth- eight player and i have to share one island with everyone who uses the same switch consul.  i deserve my own island and at very least should be able to purchase another game card to have my own island, not an entire system! I now refuse to play this game I should have never purchased it as it causes nothing but grief and bitterness between the member's of my household. Nintendo should either fix this ridiculous issue or I hope they get the lawsuit they deserve filed on behalf of disgruntled families everywhere whose children spend countless hours fighting over this game. Maybe that will make Nintendo rethink their greedy ways."

Kabegami,"Jun 28, 2020",5,"Game was pretty fun at first, it however quickly becomes boring due to lack of content. Fans say its to span out recurring players by adding back ditched content later, but I was bored after the first month anyway so that didn't turn out well for them, the updates are way too small and far in between and I can't rate this game based on what it will become, that's Bethesda territory. Previous games supposedly had plenty of stuff like Nintendo themed furniture and exploring islands with friends, but here there's none of that and I don't care if they add it later, its not the game you get on cartridge. You should however keep all the content, and add on top of it. Not remove them and add them later like they're doing here.

Everything takes forever, building new bridges and relocating a house takes a day and you can't do more than one, all this to just drag your time without a good reason, which is why people time travel, if you want to discourage time travelling by removing content, how about not making things take so long to do and putting up so many roadblocks?

I do check back into it every few days but I'm never hyped to play more or partake in any tiny events Nintendo adds, they're completely deaf to fan feedback, like that infamous egg festival and the randomness of item recipes and such can lead to lack of tables to put stuff on, making you have to use cardboard boxes or place everything on the floor. Its also lacking the simple ability many life sims have...Craft. In. Bulk."

Anima2z,"Jun 28, 2020",8,"love the game, is just bad the island lock, and it lacks some features from the old game, but they are updating it so is a 8 for me"
GingerNotANinja,"Jun 28, 2020",8,"great game, especially if you're not sharing a console with anyone. The ability to redesign your island and move things around is a great addition to the game, though even in this there are some arbitrary buildings/structures that cannot be moved, and this seems silly.
The recent announcement for the 'summer update' is a bit insulting to anyone in the Southern Hemisphere, but even the ability for us to have seasons match our own is great."
PenguinBoy,"Jun 28, 2020",8,If you can get through the waiting it's an amazing game for everyone to enjoy and is always adding new things!
vgolev,"Jun 27, 2020",2,"Boring. Grind for grind. Parasitic mechanics like it's a free to play cheap mobile game. And, for sure, the greediest idea in a history -- one player per console.

multizernez,"Jun 27, 2020",5,"the first 2 months or so of playing this is pretty fun, but once you complete the minimal content that the game offers it becomes extremely boring to play. if you're planning on buying this game, I recommend to wait until it has enough content. also if you're looking to buy this to play with your kids or something of that caliber, do not because it turns out the first person to boot up the game on their nintendo switch profile is in control of the island and the rest that boot the game up on their profile are barred from most of the content. other than that, pretty fun game."
ChickenParm,"Jun 27, 2020",9,"Great game for passing time, the multiplayer mechanics are pretty bad, but unless you're sharing your switch it's pretty much whatever, the events make for a great way to look forward to the date.

Thebigbumaloo,"Jun 27, 2020",8,"It’s a great game, but it’s not GOTY contender. I was done with it in about a week, which is a compliment, I sunk a lot of hours into building up my island. The problem with this game is that after I beat it, I had no urge to go back. I had no thoughts about it, no anything. For me, to be a GOTY contender, a game has to leave a lasting impression on you, this game was fun the moment but that’s as far as it went."

bibleblackkk,"Jun 27, 2020",9,"This game deserves a better score. This is a game which made me feel happy and relaxing. All the characters and most of the designs within it are curing me. Tough I did not spend a lot of time digging into the game, I have played more than 100 hours. In addition, I'm not the main player of the island, but I'm fine with it since I'm not playing a lot, and I still feel this is a good game. My girlfirend, who is the owner of the island, has played more than 500 hours, which means this can be a very attractive game for some players. If you feel you want the full control of the game, and want to spend a lot of time on it, you should buy a switch for it. For me, although I'm not the main player, it does not ruin my game experience, and it even makes me feel easier."

The online multiplayer mode is as good as its predecessor games, the only thing that it does not preserve is the possibility of meeting unknown people, which was very good if you had no friends. The part that multiple people share the same island on the same console is something that all the games in the series have done, I share an island with 3 other people and we are all satisfied. It is definitely a great game that I have been playing for hundreds of hours. With all the updates they will add, I am sure it will be very difficult for me to stop playing it."

BetaAthe,"Jun 26, 2020",8,"Veo que uno de los problemas que se comenta en toda review es la funcionalidad de una isla por consola. Hijos míos, esto lleva funcionando así, por lo menos, desde el Wild World. No sé cuál es la sorpresa.

El juego tiene una calidad gráfica y sonora sublime. Las animaciones están pulidas y se nota que Nintendo le quiere ponerle mimo al juego al comprometerse a ir actualizándolo a medida que pase el tiempo.

Como contras diré lo siguiente: La cantidad de objetos del juego es escasa, a mi parecer. Los eventos semanales son bastante repetitivos: Que si viene Gandulio, que si viene CJ, que si vuelve a venir Gandulio... Sin embargo, no me quejo tanto de que vengan de vez en cuando estos personajes, sino de que resulta realmente difícil que venga Ladino.

Como detalle neutral diré lo siguiente: El sistema de edición física de la isla es increíble, pero se hecha en falta poder hacer puentes sobre terrenos y no sólo sobre ríos, o el poder hacer túneles, al cavar una sección de tierra bajo otra, etc."
Hellgates666,"Jun 26, 2020",9,"This game is peak relaxation. New Horizons is the best entry in the franchise so far, and although I wouldn't normally give a game like this a 9/10, this one deserves it. Literally hundreds of hours can enjoyably be had perfecting your island, building your perfect home, bonding with your villagers, catching countless species of animals to display in your museum, digging up fossils, and more. This game has everything you'd want out of an animal crossing game and MORE. Definitely a must play, even if you don't originally think it's your type of game."
Kirb2018,"Jun 25, 2020",9,While I would give this game a 10/10 the fact that there is only one island per switch is kinda garbage but the game is really fun
SpookyPigeon,"Jun 25, 2020",0,"I made a Metacritic account just to express how disappointed I am with this game. I've been playing the Animal Crossing series since Wild World on the Nintendo DS.  I was SO hyped for this game. I got it the minute it came out on launch day, played for about a month straight aaaaand... I don't play it anymore.

This game is mediocre hence the 5 out of 10 score. Sure the graphics are nice, it runs well and the terraforming is a huge new feature. But Nintendo released an unfinished game. This game does NOT have enough content to justify the £50 I payed at launch day. So many iconic characters are missing. Where's Resetti? Where are Copper and Booker? Most importantly of all where are Rover and Brewster??? Yes I know Rover appeared briefly in the May Day update but honestly it wasn't enough screen time for such an iconic character.

Here's my other gripes with the game:

- Iconic characters like Rover got shafted but we have to sit through Isabelle's boring dialogue every single day. In this game Isabelle does the morning updates so no more Rover in the spotlight. Isabelle is frankly an extremely annoying character in this game, always repeating the same dialogue about how she found her sock or something. She's supposed to report the news but the devs didn't think for her to perhaps report on the weather or mention which town visitors are on the island. Nah it's more important for us to hear about how she finished her puzzle (nobody cares Isabelle).

- Speaking of dialogue, the villagers feel soulless compared to other games. What is the point of even talking to them when they repeat the same crap? And they always get annoyed when you talk to them twice in the same day. What a joke.

- Furniture sets are gone. No more Froggy Chair was bad enough but so many iconic furniture sets just ceased to exist. I like being able to craft but not at the expense of many classic items which fans have loved for a long time. Gracie Grace is missing from the game so now I can't decorate my house with ridiculously expensive dessert shaped furniture - wtf is the point in playing?

- Speaking of crafting, it is a long and tedious process. Say you want to craft 1 fish bait. You can't just craft 100 at once. Oh no you have to do it one by one. Everything in this game is unnecessarily difficult and even though fans have been begging for quality of life changes for months Nintendo don't care.

- Events are so bad now. The egg event in previous days was just one day. This time it was a 2 week fiasco where your normal daily activities were interrupted by the stupid eggs. During the egg event you could catch eggs by fishing, from the sky etc. The problem was that this completely ruined fishing as it felt like 80% of what you caught was eggs instead of actual fish. If all events are going to be like this from now on I'm not looking forward to events like Halloween.

- Town visitors seem to visit certain players over others with some people getting Celeste (who gives rare DIY recipes) every week while other players like myself have never had her on the island despite playing since launch day.

- Finally, on to the terraforming... It's boring. That's all. It is so tedious and so boring. I don't enjoy the terraforming which is a shame because it's the only thing to do in this game. If it's something you think you may enjoy go ahead, buy the game but ever since I unlocked terraforming my playtime has probably dropped by 80%.

There are so many other gripes I have with this game but these are the ones I had off the top of my head. It seems like Nintendo aims to keep updating the game every few months with the content that should have been included on launch day. Apparently this is to ""combat time travel"" (also why they set events to 2 weeks so people would have to play during the 2 weeks and wouldn't be able to travel back to events). I don't see why Nintendo had to release such a bare bones game just because some people are triggered by people who play the game differently.

Anyway, maybe in a year when Nintendo has actually added the content that should have been in the game to begin with I'll go back to this game but for now I can't be bothered to dedicate any time to this boring game."

ditrobix,"Jun 24, 2020",10,"Un juego que viene de maravilla en estos tiempos de cuarentena.
Adictivo a más no poder, ayuda a sociabilizar con otras personas aún en distancia y posee jugador local, aunque al final los invitados son como los esclavos del dueño de la isla XD supongo que se hizo así para que no dejaran la cagadita en la isla y lo cual tiene sentido, pasaba lo mismo con New Leaf. Así que no comprendo a esa gente que se queja de ""un rey, 7 esclavos"" evidentemente jamás jugaron un animal crossing... o se trata de un anti nintendo que le molesta saber que este juego tiene muchisimo potencial y no en sus juegos de su consola favorita.

Interesante eso de poder decorar sin necesidad de trámites en el uso de muebles tanto interior como exterior de tu casa, lo cuál abre la puerta a más posibilidades.

El único aspecto negativo del juego lamentablemente cae en lo más importante del juego. Los condenados animales del AC.
¿Por qué?
Porque al parecer los desarrolladores estaban más ocupados en hacerle caso a lo que pedían los youtubers que en su vida habían tocado el juego ni con un palo y por mera moda pedían cosas como más gente en el online, que estoy en un 100% seguro que no todos lo usan a full. Basta que uno tenga mal conexión y toda la diversión termina en el tacho de basura.

Nuevamente los animales se sienten como bots, que dependiendo de su naturaleza gruñona o feliz, etc, siempre dirán lo mismo. Por lo cual es decepcionante. Estamos hablando de más de 300 animales y fallan en la profundidad de dichos, cosas que en juegos anteriores si poseían e incluso secretos de cada uno, que acá son inexistentes, al menos en todo el tiempo que lo llevo jugando.

Por eso nada más le ha costado llevarse el último punto para llegar al 10, en algo que debiera ser primordial, hacer más ""natural"" en los animales y que no se sientan como bots.

Muchas gracias youtubers caquitas que piden cosas demasiado estúpidas, sólo para hacer que más gente participe en sus directos que más que seguro ya ni usan."
Zayzor123,"Jun 24, 2020",7,The multiplayer  part of the game needs to be better. I think everyone should be like the leader and everyone should have the same DIYs. I would also like it if every account had their own island.

1. Terrible UI designed to make you take the maximum number of clicks to do any single action

2. After you've set up your island.. there's really nothing else to do. It's really not a very replayable game.

It's fun while it lasted, but probably not the kind of game I'll play over and over again."

Intro

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the console follow up to the critical apprised portable outing, New Leaf. Nintendo has hit most Switch outing out of the part, so hoping the Animal Crossing would go leaps and bounds beyond previous titles is to be expected. While Nintendo mostly pulls this off, there are a few things that bring this title down.

Story/World Building – 3/3

This topic a bit hard to talk about due to the nature of Animal Crossing. There is not much of a story so everything comes down to the world-building that is used through characterization and everything that happens within the world. Characters are varied and fun to interact with. You normally don’t see the same dialog twice. You feel like you’re having real conversations with neighbors that live next to you. Fleshed out characters help motivate you to keep building your island so all your virtual friends can have their best lives.

Gameplay – 2/4

While there nothing inherently wrong with the gameplay, flaws start to show their ugly head once you start playing for a long period of time. Everything from fishing, collecting items to use for customization, crafting items, and shaping the world to your liking works well. The problems come in with the slow archaic menu system. It takes forever to craft items, selecting multiple of the same item, and talking to villagers for options. The option to fast skip text or being able to choose multiple of the same item would help tremendously. Online play is even more restrictive. It’s fun to hang out with friends but you are locked out from almost everything you can do on your island when someone else is visiting. You even have to watch a 30-second cutscene every time someone comes or leaves your island, stopping you from whatever you were doing. I think everything else works well with new additions such as terraforming landscapes and crafting items, which are great additions but changing the menu systems would greatly improve the overall package.

Technical/Performance – 3/3

Nintendo must have put a lot of time into the visual aspect of this game because for a game that focuses on cartoon looking animals, there are so many jaw-dropping models scattered throughout this game. Decorative items, fossils, fish, and bugs all look stunning. They mesh well with the cartoony aesthetic of the game and make it all the more satisfying to build your island. The soundtrack is pretty good albeit a bit repetitive at times. Nothing terrible but nothing outstanding. If there is one aspect that Nintendo is good at, it’s the technical side of their games.

Verdict

Animal Crossing: New Horizons will please fans of the series while welcoming newcomers all the same. It’s a fun game for all ages that don’t mind playing a game with a slower pace. There is always room in the gaming market for a game like this but I would like to see menus be a bit more intuitive so I don’t have to spend 2 hours doing something that should have taken half that time. I recommend a purchase at full price if you are a fan of this style of game. If you’re not big on life simulation games or don’t have the time to play, you can wait a while before picking this one up."
bymanabat15,"Jun 23, 2020",5,"It's a fun game. The only flaw is the 1 island only policy but overall, the game is best on what it has to offer."

BogDukh,"Jun 23, 2020",10,"Great , те кто пишут что нельзя создавать два острова , вам же сказали что над этим уже работают("
Noobly_Plays,"Jun 23, 2020",8,"Really enjoyed it. Has some pacing issues and if you don't want to timeskip you run out of stuff to do pretty quickly. If you're an old fan of the series, you're gonna love this one. If you're new to town, get ready for some minor but strange mistakes."
Davbla,"Jun 23, 2020",2,"Para algunos puede ser que les guste la isla desértica ya que te da libertad de hacer lo que quieras y construir tus cosas donde quieras. Pero a mi eso no me acaba de gustar del todo. Os explico, al principio esta bien ya que contruyes tus cosas y eso, pero con el paso del tiempo se vuelve monótono y aburrido ya que no tienes misiones y has remodelado la isla como quieres. Los otros animal crossing  puede que no te dieran tantas libertades pero tenían más eventos, personajes, actividades y ambiente."
SoyHenryVx,"Jun 22, 2020",9,"Es una combinación de relajación y diversión. Hay tanto por hacer que el proceso de mejorar tu isla y decorarla a tu gusto se vuelve adictivo. Deberían de quitar la opción de una isla por consola, es estúpido.

Propongo una lista de juegos que pueden curar los malos días, la tristeza, la depresión y el estrés, Animal Crossing: New Horizons formaría parte de ella."
Jonlivesey,"Jun 22, 2020",0,One island per user has completely ruined the game experience for me.  The switch has always been a family console and expecting families to purchase multiple machines in order to have their own island experience is simply unforgivable.
bingbang,"Jun 22, 2020",7,"This was my escape for the first few weeks of lockdown. Fun and relaxing, I only stopped playing after visiting friends' islands and seeing how much time they put into them and realising there was no way I was going to do the same."

Only one island per console.
Look new leaf"
Explofion,"Jun 22, 2020",2,"I'm so sad about that player 2 limitation. Like many I bought this game to play with my girlfriend not knowing we will have to share an island.
The idea of shared island seemed pretty funny at first but it appears to be a prison cell for player 2.
It feels like you follow the path of the true hero of the game and its pretty disappointing. At the beginning of the game you don't even got a proper introduction and for the rest you have to wait for player 1 to progress to do anything intersting.
This is our first Switch game and I must say I'm so disappointed I don't fell like playing it anymore."
EdgarMttz,"Jun 22, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons es la secuela que he estado esperando, proporcionando innumerables horas de juego y siendo una experiencia casi perfecta, definitivamente se ha modernizado, conservando ese estilo de juego clásico que se ha vuelto tan icónico. Tiene un sistema gratificante en su lugar, y tantas nuevas mecánicas interesantes para aprender, este es sin es uno de los mejores juegos de la Nintendo Switch."
Dracoshi,"Jun 22, 2020",8,"For the first 80 hours or so, this is the best Animal Crossing there's ever been. It feels like there's so much to do, and new features like moving buildings, placing furniture outside, increased creativity tools, etc. make the game so enjoyable to play. However, the longer you play, the more you realize that - in comparison to Animal Crossing games in the past - there's really not much to do/not much content in the game.

For any other game, being enjoyable for 80 hours would be amazing, but Animal Crossing has always been designed to be a game which can be enjoyed essentially for as many years as you want. But there's just not enough to do in New Horizons - a ridiculous amount has been cut from previous games, with not enough new things added to make up for it. I imagine Nintendo's plan is to add these things back as free content updates, which is understandable from their perspective as it will keep people playing the game, but there's just not enough content in the base game to keep the game feeling fun and not like a chore to play everyday. Additionally, the villagers have been watered down so much that dialogue is repeated almost constantly, and the characters barely have any personality anymore.

However, the game still gets a 8/10 from me, because for the first 80 hours or so it's the most fun I've had with a game in such a long time!"
Autumleaves13,"Jun 22, 2020",1,"If i have to be sincere... Only is fun for 1 person because the rest of people who want to live in the island can’t participate in the projects. This means that if the principal player don’t progress in the game, the rest of the players can’t progress too. Does this means that if i want to participate in the decisions of creating the island i have to buy another game? I don’t see very fair and economic doing this.
I hope Nintendo decides to do an actualization soon deleting all this barriers to the rest of players in the game."

Jessicaw,"Jun 22, 2020",7,"I can definitely agree that the one island per console is a poor decision. My five year old loves this game and that can make sharing an island difficult, but not completely awful (though I'd still prefer we each had our own island). The real time pacing also sets this game back. Not everyone wants to wait 24 real hours to construct a tiny piece of your island or move one building and other assorted tiny bits of progress. Otherwise this is still a pretty fun game."

Fryzbee,"Jun 21, 2020",8,"El juego es bueno, el apartado técnico está muy bien y en general es muy entretenido para dedicarle un tiempo diariamente. La limitación de una isla por consola y el multijugador local es algo que puede ser mejorado."
PhantomAgony,"Jun 21, 2020",9,"Para mí es el mejor juego de la saga sin duda. He jugado desde Wild World, y las posibilidades que ofrece New Horizons son una maravilla. Siento que han escuchado a los fans, que antes hacíamos caminos y personalizábamos el pueblo con diseños, al implementar el terraforming. Que puedan ponerse muebles en todo el exterior hace que tu isla pueda ser única, es la evolución que esperaba de la saga, la que siempre deseé. Además, hay muchísimas opciones de ropa y personalización del personaje. Los cambios por estaciones son geniales, los gráficos son bonitos, la música es relajante, la sensación al jugarlo es muy agradable. Siento que tengo un lugar al que huir del estrés.
No le doy un diez por algunas cosas: no me gusta encontrarme casi siempre los mismos muebles en la tienda, de los mismos colores, ni que me den casi siempre las mismas recetas. Por otro lado, las conversaciones con los vecinos se hacen un poco repetitivas. Las introducciones de Canela son tan repetitivas y aburridas que las paso sin leerlas, lo más rápido posible. Y aunque no viajo en el tiempo (me parece que cada uno puede jugar como le plazca), no me gusta depender de las actualizaciones para tener el juego completo, en mi casa el internet no es bueno y muchas veces no tengo siquiera conexión. Por otra parte, decir que es normal que sólo se pueda tener una isla por juego, en todos los Animal Crossing sólo puedes tener un pueblo por juego, es exactamente lo mismo. Lo que no me parece bien es que la isla esté ligada a la consola, lo veo un gran error. Si compras otro juego, deberías tener otra isla, que para eso lo has pagado."

KasperNyvang,"Jun 21, 2020",6,"I have ""finished the main story""  if you can say that.
First time playing a Anaimal crossing game, and i was captivated the first couple of days. But it ended up feeling like another free to play games that you play on your phone and come back everyday to complete tasks. Except this game cost 449DKK when i bought the game …"

Morgan327,"Jun 21, 2020",0,"I was pretty excited to get into the animal crossing series but this is one of the most boring, lazy, content lacking games I've ever played. There is so little to do, all you do is shake trees, catch stuff, and buy stuff. There's less content here then kirby star allies and all you do is chores. No animal crossing does not make chores fun, it just dresses them up a bit. It's essentially empty busy work to make it look like you have something to do. Have you ever had a game tell you how you have to play?, no?, then try new horizons. The npc's are boring, isabelle is nothing more then a mold for a cute character and nothing more, the other villagers only have 2 or 3 lines when you talk to them and the UI is so clunky it takes like 6 minutes for me to leave somebody's island, go grab an item from storage, and then come back. This is the worst game I've ever played. I'd rather play paper mario sticker star."
HazeTheHawk13,"Jun 21, 2020",0,"They cut Everything out of the Game, all past shops, features, many of the house upgrades, the original Animal Crossing you could have 15 villagers, here only 10. The Islands feel small and cramped, villagers don't really do side quests any more,no Diving, no Multiplayer mini games, All users on a single consoleMust share the same tiny island. Less plants, Only two shops I'm the game with Books Cranny only having one upgrade, the Island editor is slow and limited, custom paths can still be kicked off the ground, no daily or monthly events, loading times that shouldn't exist. Besides Graphics this is the worst entry in the series. I could go on even more if I wanted."
Cross2killer,"Jun 20, 2020",5,It is just another animal crossing game. It's long and kinda boring most of the time but partly by design. I do fell like like they have stripped away a lot of the NPCs personally.
RegularWaffles,"Jun 20, 2020",8,Not taking in account of second players or multiplayer as those factors will affect the rating. This game is a nice sequel on the switch and the gameplay is nice and subtle over the course of every day as resources take time to gather. it is a nice slice of life game and hope that they will put in the effort to help issues involving additional players to the island.

oilForWater,"Jun 20, 2020",3,"Nintendo has gotten greedy. They dont allow separate islands unless you have another switch, which is a problem because only the island leader gets to do things that are fun. And also, my sister can go through the island getting all the rocks, fruit and weeds so i dont get to do anything other than fish. They should make it like the older games where you can have multiple characters, but they should do that all in one profile, so that if you want to you can have your own island or share one, or both at once. I only gave it a 3 because of the graphics. But if they fixed the one island thing it would be a 9 or 10"
sham0us,"Jun 20, 2020",6,"Animal Crossing is a very fun game to play, mostly in the beginning. First off you're first two islanders are not totally random as the male will always be a Jock villager and the female will always be an Uchi villager. So in those regards if you're favorite villager is in one of those two categories then you could just keep soft resetting until you get one of them.  Now there is a lot to do once you begin like fishing and catching bugs for your museum, but there is a lot of halt in progress in trying to get materials once you need to open the shop and it is expected in Animal Crossing that you will need to wait for it to open. There's really no problem with this and if you can't really wait just time travel a day ahead if you really don't wanna wait, it just depends on how you want to play. Now as of now it seems like a just long halt waiting for something new to happen. Of course since it's now June there is a lot more fish and bugs you're able to catch so that can give you something to do, but what happens when you catch everything you need? It seems like a cycle of just waiting for something new to come or just hoping a new event will happen soon, but besides that right now we need some quality of life changes. Like being able to access materials from home, people able to craft multiple things at once, etc. We got an upgraded inventory and it still feels small having to hold all these materials around all the time. Now moving on the topic of villagers, at least now you don't have to worry about a villager moving away on you randomly since they will always ask if they should leave or not, but it does get a little repetitive talking to them because they mostly say the same things all the time and if you have two of the same personality types of two villagers, you're not seeing double, you're seeing the same dialogue. But besides that, they are at least very interactive now and don't just walk around aimlessly doing nothing. On to the topic of online, since I only really play with one person it doesn't work that badly, but when in a group of people it could be very annoying seeing someone arrive every 5 minutes and having to wait through the loading time. Besides that, it doesn't really feel like there's much to do online, it just feels like you're doing your basic activities but on someone else's island. Sure you could come up with some mini games to play with your friends, that's always an idea, but that's not content from the game. That's you coming up with your own ideas of how to make the game fun. As of right now the game feels very stale, and just waiting around for something new to do isn't very exciting, hopefully we get some new content soon because as of right now everything just feels repetitive."

Basagh,"Jun 19, 2020",9,"(No he jugado los juegos anteriores) La verdad, el juego me encanto, me imagino que es porque tuve la oportunidad de tener una isla para mi solo y jugarlo en paralelo con mi hermano. el hecho de poder ir viendo como el otro progresa junto a ti y poder compartir conocimientos, es maravilloso. Respecto al juego en si, esta bastante bien, ya que que el sistema de progreso en el juego, esta bien implementado, teniendo que esperar al siguiente día para poder avanzar, impidiendo que se haga una experiencia corta. La personalización es bastante buena, pudiendo cambiar; la forma y color de los ojos, la forma y color del pelo, distintas zapatillas, pantalones, accesorios para la cabeza (sombreros, gorras, mascarillas, etc.), y lo mas importante (desde mi punto de vista), poder personalizar tus propios polerones, camisas, chaquetas, poleras (con o sin mangas), y a la vez, poder descargar diseños de otros jugadores y compartir tus diseños. Tu isla puede cambiar demasiado, existen muchísimos esquemas distintos que sirven para fabricar una gran variedad de artículos, grandes y pequeños, para ambientar como tu quieras tu isla. un punto muy débil, es la nula presencia del cooperativo, limitándose a una isla por pantalla, la razón por la que esto no le bajo mas la nota, fue porque no interfirió con mi experiencia, pero comprendo a las personas que si. En conclusión es un juego bastante didáctico, duradero y personalizable, pero si quieres disfrutarlo con otra persona, vas a tener que tener dos nintendo switch y dos copias del juego"
Dwyerr98,"Jun 19, 2020",6,"Been playing this game since launch and was really excited for this game beforehand, at first I was in love with the game and just happy to play a new animal crossing game on switch, I loved the fact we started off with basically nothing and had to work with Tom nook to build up our island, but after completing the little story mode in nook and having played the game for a while it’s not all I thought it would be. First I do love the fact that we have a lot more ways when customising our island such as getting to place and move villager houses, shops and museum and even our own house and the new terraforming tool is great, also really like the idea of crafting our own items and furniture feels like it gives me more things to do in the game itself and helps me when wanting more furniture/ items when doing my island up. Also love getting to go to the NMT islands to find villagers instead of getting a random villager moving in when one moves out. There is also a lot more seasonal events in the game which gives the player a lot more to do in game. Graphics have obviously improved and I actually like the new music in the game, and there is a lot more with character customisation. I feel like they have gone all out with the customisation in the game which I love as I can really be creative with my island But I feel like a have more negatives than positives which is a shame because i was really looking forward to this game. The game has improved in many ways but in others it just lacks a lot, firstly I feel like a lot of the personalities of the villagers just feel the same and they say the same things quite a lot and as soon as you speak to them once they kind of get sick of you if you try again, there is only 2 shops in the game (able sister and nooks cranny) and evening though these shops are good, I feel like we need more shops in the game and the shops we have could me improved so much more, for instance in able sisters when going into the changing room you can only buy a set of clothing and then need to come out and then back into the changing room and rinse and repeat if you want to buy multiple sets, it gets quite annoying after a while, also nooks cranny is lacking I feel like a get a lot of repeat furniture and the shop itself only has one upgrade with is a downgrade from previous games, this game does offer crafting so we can make most stuff ourselves but there’s a lot of furniture you have to buy and also I loved upgrading the shop multiple times as I became a goal for me. The game is either missing previous NPC’s or they are again lacking such as Leif and kicks only showing up every now and again only with a stall with a select amount of items and then the likes of rooster and his shop and a bunch of the ACNL Main Street shops missing with there NPC’s missing. The Nook mile tickets are w good idea but the items you can buy or always the same apart from the fence diys as they change daily, and I feel a lot of the NMT Islands become very similar after a while and don’t really offer anything unless your looking for a villager or a specific rare island but even then I feel like they should offer more, also more of a minor issue but I think we should have more custom design slots, we do have more than what we had in ACNL but still we should have a lot more, I feel like I see so many amazing custom designs online but I can’t use them as I have filled all my slots which custom designs that I am currently using on my island

Also there is another 2 main issues I have with the game first being that there can only be one island per switch so if you share a switch with someone and you both want to play the game you have to play on the same island and only one player can do most of the stuff such as starting the island up when you create it, feel like this is such a step back considering the switch itself feels like its advertised as a family sharing console, also don’t like the fact that there is no cloud saves so if you make an island on one switch you can only play it on that switch, I think they are trying to make a way round this but still annoying

I think a good thing about this game is that the devs are frequently updating the game and adding stuff in to the game bit by bit so a lot of the issues I have could be added in through an update which is good but that’s if they choose to add this stuff into the game and also I feel like some of my issues and things missing from the game shouldn’t of been added through updates they should of been apart of base game Overall I am still enjoying this game a lot but it could be so much more."
glypheye,"Jun 19, 2020",0,"Here we go, folks.  I said I wouldn't do **** here I am....about to give a good game....a bad score.  **** deserves it.

The game itself is endearing....beautiful....well **** has the bones for **** (and a very big ""IF"", indeed) you are the primary player on your island.

My youngest daughter is the primary island **** I have played with her as a visitor.  I am here to say...that the experience between the primary owner and the visitors is vastly different.  Visitors are essentially drones for the primary.  There's no joy to be had because there's none of the feeling for working for something you consider ""yours"".   And therein lies the rub, friends and neighbors.  In terms **** experience to be shared  with others....this game is crap.  But, in terms of playing the game for one's personal experience of personalizing your island and interacting with AI's.....this game is pure gold.  In as **** require families to have to BUY A WHOLE NEW SWITCH GAMING **** HAVE TO BUY A WHOLE NEW GAME CARTRIDGE ITSELF TO PLAY A SEPARATE GAME SAVE WITH A NEW **** ABSOLUTELY A DISGUSTING MONEY GRAB ON NINTENDO'S PART!  There is no other way to interpret this maneuver by Nintendo.  It's inexcusable and its egregious enough of a ploy to drag this reviewer's review score alllllllll the way down.

There are times when coercive publisher behavior....consumer ransom, so to **** so repulsive that outcry is the only way to change that behavior.  It happened to EA with Battlefront ii.  It's not going to happen to AC:NH, though I know.  Nintendo is too impeachable to the millions and millions of fans.  They can do no wrong.  Still....there are some here who've been courageous enough to trash the score for trashy behavior.  Kudos to **** know who you are."
LunarD3ATH,"Jun 19, 2020",9,"This is a fantastic game. Let's get that nailed in right out of the gate, because while I agree with the complaints about Nintendo's handling of cloud saves, individual islands and so on, I don't think that reflects so poorly on the game that it deserves to be review-bombed. Though I do believe review-bombing has its place and if it helps, then so be it, I won't object.

This is the BEST Animal Crossing game. Period. It's not only visually stunning, it has tons of improvements large and small that have made this a joy to continue to play. Usually I'm done with Animal Crossing by now. I buy a copy, I play it for a month or two, then I drop it and rarely ever come back unless really bored and only for a few minutes, even for holiday events.

But with the wide depth of customization options for your villager, your home and your island, this really is the most control we've ever had in an Animal Crossing game.

To counter the negativity, let's point out some of the pros:

First, you can customize your character right from the start, rather than getting random hair and face options. You have limited options at the start, but you can unlock more later and it's as simple as checking your face in a mirror to change literally any aspect of your little avatar's personal appearance.

Storage items are linked to your house storage. Namely your clothing. So basically not only will your wardrobe serve as a wardrobe (even if placed outdoors), but so will your fridge, your cooler, your safe, etc. It's a little silly, but honestly it's a nice way of having a way of changing your outfit wherever you go while blending the furniture in. Don't want a wardrobe outside just to change? Put a fishing cooler by the shore or something. It's great.

Second, you can place furniture items outside. This, combined with the much-touted island designer tool (place paths, pools or rivers of water and cliffs), allows you to make your town look the way you want it like New Leaf could only DREAM of achieving. Gone are the public works projects for a bench that take a whole day and a ludicrous amount of funding (and weird celebrations about a piece of furniture being delivered). Gone are the days of feeling like your town would take YEARS to look the way you want it to, with cheap paths that hitting the wrong button over would get rid of (though that feature is still there for custom design paths and I HATE IT; fix this, Nintendo).

Now if you want to have a bench outside Able Sisters for your villagers to rest their buns, you just find a bench (or build one yourself with the handy new crafting system) and place it. That's it. You can even move it around like it was inside of your house.

Third, as mentioned, CRAFTING. Many people were worried about this when it was introduced and there are valid complaints about it that even I have, but this is 100% a change for the better, it really is. Yes, your tools now break. And that ****. Especially since all tools break now and you can't even check durability, but making them is easy enough and that's only a small part of what this system offers. There are tons of basic, unique and holiday-oriented craftable items that you can make over and over if you're dedicated enough to find the recipes, the materials and make them. And since getting recipes is a daily affair (every day there will be a bottle on the beach with a random, hopefully new, recipe in it), you're going to discover tons of cool new stuff every week, as long as you keep turning Animal Crossing on and messing about.

Fourth, Nook Miles. I don't think I've heard anyone complain about this. And no one should. It's nothing but a good thing to give you incentives to do stuff like fish, catch bugs, hunt fossils, talk to villagers, etc. It's encouragement in the form of ""miles"" to get you to play the game, where you can then redeem those miles for special recipes and items for yourself and your town. Custom phone case, fence recipes (fences are great for customization and another perk of the new game), furniture items, nook miles tickets to go to a randomized island and hunt collectible fish/bugs and resources.

You'll first start off with static, one-time-only rewards like a couple hundred miles for catching 10 bugs, then a thousand or so for 100, then catch 200+ and you get 2,000 miles (along with titles for your villager's passport, if that at all interests you, which you also get miles for editing once). Then after paying off your vacation package with those earned miles, you can build a house and start earning miles in the form of daily, renewable objectives (shoot a balloon down for some miles or assess x number of fossils) so you never run out of things to keep working towards if you want to keep yourself busy. It's great motivation to keep playing, though eventually it does become a bit bland, I won't lie. Still, I like having it.

I've run out of characters, sadly. It's a fun game."
dizzlegizels,"Jun 19, 2020",0,"Absolutely unthinkably stupid to limit one island per switch. Asinine. Idiotic.

My kids were excited about all the buzz, they were thrilled to visit the website and see how they could make their own little world.  Then they bought it. To have that reality yanked away, I don't think I'm being overly dramatic here, but it was kinda cruel. My kids saved up to buy this game. What in god's name are they thinking?

It's lovely to see, in the time of forced quarantine, a game touting itself as a stress relieving, calming, creative time spender, to literally 'yoink' that promise away for everyone but the first household member to log on.

Anyone who has anything to do with this should be ashamed, because you should know, and I don't think I'm the only one: you literally made my kids cry. Not because they're spoiled, or that they can't share, or they won't work together.  It's that they saved up for something that was advertised as ""something"" and got absolutely blindsided by a product that is specifically, maliciously exclusive of their creative interests.  It's about having watched hours of people loving the game on youtube, and then the game saying, 'No, you absolutely cannot do what they are doing.'

Of course, the ""same island"" mode as it exists would be SO MUCH **** it was an option.

If you gave this game a good score because you're the only person playing it...I think you're missing the point. This game is mean to families. It is. There's not really another way to put this."

The game has also a lot of updates and the 4 seasons are really great to maximize your experience and make it the most unique amongst other players.

I am disappointed in the game, since in that case they would have better allowed one island per profile."
GreenGamerGure,"Jun 15, 2020",10,"First of all, I want to say to all players who have given a bad review to this game, due to the creation of only one island per nintendo switch, that this has been this way ALWAYS. If you have played before the AC for Gamecube, City folk, Wild World and New Leaf, ALL OF THEM, only allowed the creation of one city, town, or whatever. All of the other games didnt recieve a negative rating due to this, so please, if you are new in AC, I suggest that you should inform yourself before buying the game.

Now, putting all that anger aside.... Animal Crossing New Horizons it's been the best game of the series.
*DIY recipes: A whole new feature that makes you work hard to get specific items and even trade recipes with other players
*Event and new features updates: Allowing you to have more special visitors, more DIY recipes, more festival events, new building upgrades, etc.
*Clothing: A huge amount of clothing, costumes and more. All of the clothing with vivid colors and an excellent design.
*New villagers and new ways to get them: New flashy and adorable villagers like Raymond, Judy, Shreb, etc. And also the new feature: campsite, where you can get a random new villager. You can now help/avoid villagers to leave your island and they cannot move out without your concern. Additionally, if a villager moves out you can invite friends or other people to come and pick up villagers to move to their islands.
*Nookmiles program: Doing specific activities will allow  you to redeem Nook miles, which can be used for Nook Mileage Items or for Dodo Mystery tours. These activities vary from completing one time only objectives, to random daily chores.
*Dodo Mystery tours: Allowing you to go to randon small islands where you can not only get more resources but even find a new villager
*Enhanced online mode: Even though it sometimes crashes, this mode is way better than in the other games. Allowing you to trade, explore, fish, catch bugs, get new DIY, talk with special guests and more.

In short, if you are looking ofr a life simulation game and love animals, designing and even interacting with other people online, this game is definitely for you. Highly recommended :)!

PS: Prepare to invest a HUGE amount of your time in designing and decorating your island haha"
Meeleepit,"Jun 15, 2020",9,"Bought this on a whim, never played any Animal crossing games.

Played non stop and on 65 hours already. I really have no idea why i cant stop playing this game.

For some reason the game **** you in. If you want stress free game play play Animal Crossing.

The whole sharing an island mechanic is not an issue for me, it actually works in my favor . Imagine my daughter and wife called me the whole time to come and help them with their own islands, will drive me crazy. Them sharing my already build island helps a lot.

Not worth the full retail price but this being a Nintendo exclusive the price will never go down so might as well pay full price for it."

It also brings lots of new features to the table, along with some annoyances, which hopefully get patched out. My actual score would probably a 7.5 or 8, but, well, you know. Seriously guys, stop being children. There are numbers between 1 and 10."
Sephy,"Jun 14, 2020",2,Just picked the game up for me and my wife to play and should have done more research. One island really??? So very disappointed in this and has left a bad taste making us not to really want to continue playing. The game seems fun so far but what's the point if we both can't have our own individual experience while playing together.
GameDevsSuck,"Jun 13, 2020",4,"At its most basic, it succeeds as an AC game. If you’re looking for something new in the AC franchise this will entertain you without issue if you play sporadically. Spend a good amount of time with it and you will see how careless and thoughtless some of the design decisions are. Crafting seems to have been added as an afterthought because it polled well with focus groups. Building your own tools fits the theme of beginning life again on a new island, but after it loses its novelty, its just a VERY basic durability system that doesn’t show any gradual degradation. Your perfect-looking net or axe just vanishes with a poof after enough uses. It tries to encourage a loop of gathering and crafting, but crafting more than one or two things at a time is so tedious I’d often find myself pulling up a different screen to look at. I’m not saying the system doesn’t belong in the game, but the combination of ‘only random’ (still multiple duplicates or recipes from the recipe kits available at the very start of the game) recipe acquisition, clunky crafting UI, and literally no form of progression makes me wonder how much more robust this kind of system could be in 2020.

The biggest killer for me was the villager system. If someone moves out you get a vacant lot in their place. It will randomly fill after some random number of days. This feels like someone else making villager choices for you while you accidentally left your switch unattended. I think this is so you will feel pressured into buying Amiibos to help replace villagers you did not invite to your island. Having them move out on their own can take WEEKS (This system is what made me want to leave this review).

Many of the systems in place to add a sense of a dynamic town begin to feel punishing. Random vendors/NPC visit the island but are limited to one visit per week. Take a day off from playing when the ones making collectibles of the things you caught happen to be visiting? Better luck next week! There are a lot of QoL issues that become infuriating after you spend enough time with the game. So many buttons go unused in menus and elsewhere. Buying items requires you to get them one or five at a time, clicking through multiple screens of unskippable text each time for the privilege. It just seems like they ran out of time making all the items and focusing on visual appeal (It’s great!) and had to sacrifice having a deep look at the big flaws in this iteration. This game will be worth buying when it’s been out for a few major overhauls. They’ll focus on seasonal events and patching out exploits in between DLC releases. My prediction is they will never make any attempt at addressing the ‘minor’ issues outlined here because they don’t break the game, they just make it more frustrating to play."
Breadman42,"Jun 13, 2020",9,"One of my favourite games! At first i thought i wouldn't like it, but I've been addicted ever since launch!

The only reason i haven't given it a ten is because of the fact that you can't have two islands on one switch. This is **** because 1: It's more than possible and 2: this is a casual game, so it attracts those who aren't avid gamer's. So if i'm playing this game and my younger sister wants to play it too, she has to buy ANOTHER switch if she wants her own island.

Apart from that this games is perfect! there are various quality of life features that Nintendo could fix but they barely take away from the gaming experience. I will be playing this game for a long, long time!"
Shaylynner,"Jun 12, 2020",0,"My parents bought this for me (16) and my little sister (9) ‘s birthdays. It was a shared gift. As, cuz of the pandemic this was our main gift ( it was my main gift besides a necklace for my sweet sixteen < which thanks to quarantine I got to spend with no friends) I was so greatly looking forward to having a little island to get away to, but the morning we received it my sister got up at like 6am and went straight to it, she named it (spelt the name of the island wrong) and played on. Nonetheless when I came downstairs I was so excited to do the same, but then I noticed something odd, I didn’t get to create my own island. I became a “side character” in my nine year old sisters island. It was devastating, I tried to go along and play anyways but I’ve decided to give up, once I realized I won’t get to move lots or do ANYTHING BIG TO CUSTOMIZE the island it’s worthless to me. It makes me so sad to see her play the game and I wish I could do all the things she does, but I can’t. I don’t get to do much but chop wood and run around"
Griffin09076,"Jun 12, 2020",0,I wanted to love this game but i just can't when the game has the insane restriction of only 1 island per switch. meaning that if you are one of the many people that share a switch with multiple people TOO BAD! You're gonna have to share an island with the first person that boots up the game. And if that wasn't bad enough you can hardly do anything on the island without the permission of the island owner. This restriction was not done because of technical limitations but because Nintendo was greedy and wanted to reach their slimy disgusting hands into your wallet to take even more money from you. So thanks Nintendo. Thanks for putting unnecessary restrictions on your game that prevent certain people from enjoying a product that they paid for.
SuperkenGaming,"Jun 12, 2020",8,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons
Not a game for everyone
New Horizons is my first animal crossing ever, I had to see what all the ladies were raving about…
So I sat down with your girlfriends favorite game.. and while it took me a while to get it.. I got it…
The Good of animal crossing new horizons is its addictive and calming, a game all about chosing the layout of your island and building it, letting it flourish.. learning new items to craft, becoming friends with your neighbors, ctaching bugs, fishing, collecting shells.. palnting flowers, planting trees.. just enjoying the breaze through your Nintendo switch, all on your journey to make your newly aquired island livable.. you can earn cash by selling these items you collect and use this cash to buy items to furnish your home or pay of your debts to obtain an even bigger and better home… its  anice little carrot at the end of this stick, collect, craft, design until youre statisfied.. there is no end goal here.. this is a game all about playing until youre done.. not until the game is done.. until you are done, until youre bored of it.. as this is a game meant to be played throughout the years to come.. stopping in for an hr or so a day, slowly progressing your island… and onto the bad of animal crossing progression here is far too slow, it took me 6 real time days to do anything beyond fish or collect bugs… as once again this game runs in real time, when youre told a building will be done tomorrow, the game literally means tomorrow, but for the sake of this review I time skipped with the switches settings.. I get that this is a game meant to be chipped away at, but I feel its ridiculous to expect someone to invest 6 days into a game they just purchased before things start getting good… and the only other bad here is coop.. you cant share your nintendo switch with your significant other or siblings… one switch shares an island.. but other than those 2 huge knocks theres everything here an animal crossing fan could want… and for those into games they can hop into to relax, destress, and decorate a little, catch some bugs or fish, dig some fossils for the museum..
The decorator in you, the collector in you.. both will shine with excitement for hours…
For me personally Animal Crossing New Horizon got 10 hours out of me before I was over it.. but its okay to be over it.. This is what makes this game so special, Theres no pressure, everything is at your pace, and the day or hour you decide to leave your island is a day youll look back with memories of collecting or gathering this, the moment you spent inside of your head as you fished.
Animal Crossing New Horizons is one giant exhale.
I give Animal Crossing: New Horizons
an 8/10"
Reviewnimation,"Jun 12, 2020",9,"This games is amazing. Creating your very own, unique island is extremely fun. This game is so close to being perfect but it is missing a fair amount of the previous game's content. This will all most likely be resolved when updates come out. Nearly perfect."

seiji092,"Jun 7, 2020",6,"I would give a 10, but this game definitely needs some fine tuning, which Nintendo will probably not listen to. Let us not forget who are we talking about after all.
The main reason is the stupid progress being restricted to the first player who boots the game and you can only have a single island per console. The player 1 is the island representative who can makes the progress, everyone who enters the island is unable to make any such progress. For this person the score might be 10.
Overall, AC is a game where you create a bond with all your villagers and town. You get this change of pace from our fast IRL and see your little village growing into a teeming town, very slowly if you don't change your in-game time and to me, it's that feature that really makes the AC unique.
Some quality of life tweaks are very needed to make the game more enjoyable IMHO. Such as, bulk crafting, shopping cart in the clothes store and many more. However, that this isn't an enjoyable game overall, the feeling of progress with some new features to the series made the game a nice pick."
jaskin444,"Jun 7, 2020",0,This game is a huge letdown. The camera is atrocious constantly blocking your line of sight preventing you from seeing what you want to do.

We didn't know this, so my partner has now just been put on my island with no real way to progress with his own story and nowhere near the same immersive experience I had.

HolyMoly8,"Jun 5, 2020",0,"I bought this game for myself and my girlfriend. I thought it would be okay for both of us to play it, but that was not the case. The fact that each Switch console can only have 1 island in total, ruins the whole game if more than 1 person wants to play. I was looking forward to playing it, but as I want my girlfriend to have a good time with it, I am unable to play at all because of the huge restrictions put on anyone who is not the island representative. And when playing co-op together, all you can do is run around, equip tools and use them, and pick up items, which don't even go to your inventory, because you don't have an inventory. If you can play it alone, it's a great game, but as it stands, I can't play a game that I payed for. It's an absolute joke."

There are definitely some small quality of life issues but they by no means ruin the game. It's adorable and relaxing and so easy to throw hours and hours of your time into without even realizing it. You can play for an hour one day and then get tired of it but the need to come back the next day and check in on everything is always there.
PriitySiick,"Jun 3, 2020",8,"I love this game.
A collectors dream game! With thousands of fish, bugs, fossils, paintings, furniture, and clothing items this game will keep anyone busy. It's very slow. It goes by real world time, but can be tricked by adjusting the system time in order to speed things up or even play into the ""Stalk"" market to gain an absurd amount bells early on. 10/10

The terraforming leaves a lot to be desired. It is very slow and tedious with only being able to change one space at a time. If you mess up you just wasted twice the amount of time on one space. 9/10

As someone who doesn't share their console with other people I never felt like I was in the backseat. However, I have taken a point off for the highly flawed multi-user experience as I feel it does take away from the game.  8/10"
Versi,"Jun 2, 2020",2,"Animal crossing: New Horizons Is the sparkling new addition to the animal crossing franchise. It was received greatly when it came out and I'm sure we can all admit it's a very pretty game.

Unfortunately the attraction to this game is about skin deep, it doesn't take long to break down the gameplay and run out of goals to accomplish. It starts to get boring and honestly kind of tedious to even open. When you get started it's a lot of fun to explore your new town and look at all the new and updated graphics, but after awhile the furniture and clothing starts getting repetitive, and the lack of gameplay freedom starts to just get frustrating. This is a beautiful mobile game that they shelled out for 60 dollars."
Areina,"Jun 2, 2020",0,"I was really wanting to get this game. But after talking with friends it seems like a waste. I intended to be able to share the console with other members of my family who were also interested in this game. But the one island per console system has made that an impossibility. It is ridiculous to suggest that multi person families should shell out $200-300 per console plus a frankly overpriced $60 per game copy as well. This is greedy and a poor move on Nintendos part. At this point I probably wont even buy a switch, because I dont like supporting money grubbing companies like this one. I dont know who along the development line thought this was a reasonable decision, but it seems like they've caused a huge loss in potential sales as a lot of people seem to have decided against the game/console due to this greedy tactic. Considering the console itself is already overpriced for what it is, I'm not sure Nintendo  products are worth investing in anymore."
Nikg92,"Jun 2, 2020",10,"This game more than lived up to my expectations. Some people are complaining about the one island per console limit and that is valid. At the end of the day, this doesn't affect me as I see the Switch as more of a personal console than a family (shared) console so I personally am fine with this limitation. But on the other hand, save file limitations have been part of the franchise since its inception. You've never been able to store multiple save files (on one medium) for any Animal Crossing game. I'm sure this is meant to encourage sharing a single town for a more genuine and social experience, but some players don't like to be told how to play and I get it.
Almost every aspect of the game is beautiful and amazing. Though, the background music for the island is a bit monotonous and lacks the variety of previous titles. In all past titles, there were always one or more background songs that I genuinely loved but none from this one have really sung to me. Another problem I have with this game is that arranging stacked furniture outside in a particular orientation is cumbersome and sometimes outright impossible. Another final complaint, and I could be wrong here, but it seems like the non-event-specific DIY recipes are granted in a purely random fashion where a weighted random algorithm would likely be more fair and enjoyable to players."

JennX,"May 31, 2020",1,I suppose it's a great solo game but if you are more than 1 people with 1 console it's unplayable. The first one to play take the resources to craft a couple of tools and the other player doesn't have resouces to do anything. You have to wait 24 hours for the resources to respawn  To be able to play if you are 3 players you have to play 1 day on 3 to let everyone grab their resources. That's really a shame to transform 1 of the favorite Nintendo game into a game that you have to buy 1 console by game copy........

Maybe if they fix all their Day One Dev mistakes I'll come back, but seeing as its Nintendo I doubt they even see an issue. You'd think they've never made a game before, or havent been around for the last decade where crafting have been put into pretty much every game, and far better than in this one.

SirLedyuka,"May 30, 2020",0,"TL;DR
The game is not finished nor polished. it looks like a giant beta with lots of feature that Nintendo put in the game for testing, but are very limited. I'm convinced the team that developed AC:NH is not as skilled nor experienced in game design than the one who've done the previous games.

This game is a deception:
- One island per console. You want to play with your relatives? Buy a new console you pigeon!

- The local multiplayer is simply awful: the current player is considered ""Master"" and the second player a ""Slave"". As a slave, you can do absolutely nothing. NOT EVEN OPEN YOUR OWN INVENTORY. The local multiplayer is basically useless.

- The UI design is bad, really bad. You need to pass 3 dialog boxes minimum before even reaching the feature you want. Characters talk to say nothing, really.

- The famous ""Characters are more intelligent now! They're aware with their environment"" is completely **** They're no real upgrade of the dialogue system, villagers end-ups saying the same thing over and over again. The environmental awareness basically adds one dialogue out of the 20s they have.

- You don't get to choose you villagers. If you fall with a villager you don't want, you're screwed, as the mechanism behind a villager moving out is strange; nobody knows exactly how it works. For me, I had to wait 2 months for a specific villager, out of the 6 I don't wanted in my island, to go.

- If one of your villager move out, you have only a day to find another you want. Otherwise, the game will automatically give you a random one, too bad if you don't want him ¯_(ツ)_/¯.

- It 's been 3 month since the release of the game. The only update we had were about ""fixing stuff"" and reducing some insects spawn because player could make a lot of money with it (But they let people sell their villager for an insane amount of money; see what happened to Raymond, it's just disgusting), and adding characters that should've been in the initial release of the game (Redd and Leif).

- The craft system is very basic. You can't even craft multiple object at once, or use materials stocked in your house directly in the craft system.

- It seems there's less insects and fishes to capture. Gyroids have been completely removed from the game. You read that right.

- The game has a ""story"" that you can reach in about 1-2 weeks (because the game makes you wait one day each time you progress). When you finally reached that goal, the credits play, and it feels like there's nothing else to do in the game. Because there's nothing else to do in the game.

- There's even less interactions with Nook and Isabelle than the last game. I thought it would be time for Nintendo to let players know Isabelle and Nook better, but no.

- Speaking of them, they do the daily announcements every time you launch the game. After the completion of the main goal of the game, Isabelle will, EVERYDAY, says that there's nothing to say, unless you have someone move in/out, or a special event.
Basically, this feature is useless after spending 1-2 weeks in the game.

- The RNG behind the crafting recipes is broken. It's like the game doesn't want you to learn new items to craft. For weeks I stumble upon the same crafting recipes everyday. This is even more infuriating when the recipe you earn is composed of other recipe you don't have.

- The whole Island Terraformation was a great idea, but badly executed. You can only terraformate one cell at the time. Your island is about 100*100 cells. It'll take you days before you reach your terraformation goal.

- Remember when you could invite villagers to your house? Forget that. It does not exist in this game.

There's a lot of thing Nintendo could have done to polish the game. There's a lot of features that are missing from the previous games, a lot of characters that are missing too.
The game doesn't seem finished, nor polished in any way. In 3 months, we had ONE update with 2 characters that should've have been in the initial release of the game.
Nintendo doesn't seem to care. but since the game is one of the most sold game of all time on switch, I don't think they'll continue to update the game with new characters and upgraded features.
The hype killed the game."

JAVN,"May 29, 2020",8,"New Horizons is a a great addition to the animal crossing series.....However

So i picked up New Horizons as my first game after buying a switch during lock down, i saw it as a relaxing game to kill a lot of hours to get through the current pandemic, and i want to start by saying that it did exactly that, from the moment i booted the game up i was instantly hooked on the idea of building my island from the ground up and creating the environment i want, from carefully placing items to create cute little Cafes to acquiring my favorite villagers, Animal Crossing seemed to have it all, and after 2 weeks and 175 hours of game play later i was still discovering new items and new little quirks that kept the game compelling and intriguing.

Now however, as great as i just stated the game was, and let me reiterate still is, there are still issues with the game, for a start, Terra forming and overall island customization, i'm honestly surprised this hasn't been touched upon by other reviewers but i personally felt this side of the game incredibly frustrating and lacking in creative freedom, i lost count on the amount of times i went to place down a tree, in plenty of room, only to be told by the game that ""There isn't enough room"" on far too many occasions ideas for island designs where ruined by the games little leg room when it comes to item placing, Now. let me get onto Terra forming, now i'm willing to give the game some leniency in this department, partially because its a rare feature to find implemented in any Nintendo game period, never mind an Animal Crossing game, and while the feature is overwhelmingly well received and massive for giving the players a sense of customization and the ability to really make their island their **** incredibly clunky, like to the point i almost don't want to use it, i don't know i feel like a lot of Animal Crossings customization features in this game are very limiting, while at the same time giving players the freedom to still do almost anything they desire, its a strange middle ground and one that while frustrating at times, i suppose i still managed to look past when you realize how simplistically charming the rest of the game is.

In conclusion, is Animal Crossing a great game? Yes definitely, is it perfect? No, however with its charming art style, addictive game play, and ability to edit your island to your desire, is it a game that is guaranteed to keep you hooked and checking in every day? definitely"
bioann,"May 29, 2020",10,"Игра, которая помогла мне справиться с полным отсутствием интереса к играм моей жены. Теперь мы каждый вечер, после того, как наш ребёнок засыпает в обнимку со своим любимым плюшевым зайцем, мы залипаем со своими любимыми животными (жителями) на своих консолях Nintendo Switch. У каждого свой остров и каждый по своему счастлив, хотя продолжаем ездить друг к другу в гости, чтобы полить цветы и увидеть изменения с последнего визита. Игра, которая раскрывается только в купе с богатой фантазией и желанием творить. Жанр игр серии Animal Crossing, как мне кажется, лучше всего описала со супруга: «дизайнерская песочница». От себя добавлю, что это ещё и отличный таймкиллер, в котором одно удовольствие проводить большое количество времени каждый день. 450+ часов с момента первого запуска и это даже не половина того, на что она способна."
Robert2,"May 29, 2020",10,I’ve spent 200 hours on this game and it is so much fun. I do not understand why people would give it a zero solely because it has no second island option. Sure it’s kind of annoying to share with my sister but this game is really well done and fun to play. You can tell the developers put in a lot of time and effort and they still come out with major free updates. I think a lot of developers could learn from this like game freak by allowing free updates that improve the game over time instead of dlc that costs 30 dollars for assets that should have been in the base game. Kinda going off on Pokémon so I’ll get back to animal crossing. I love all of the new characters and improved quality of life additions. One complaint is the tool durability but it’s only a minor pain once you upgrade your shop. I’d give it a 9.5 out of ten but I want to give a ten to combat all of the zeros given to this game.

Ekspym,"May 29, 2020",2,"AC would be such a perfect game if it was developed by anyone with decent brain. Calming and almost perfect single player is absolutely ruined by horrible, tragic and absolutely disgusting multiplayer made by **** hamster. I dont even care about the fact that you cant play 2 islands on one switch but even when we bought 2 switches for me and my gf .Online is so horrible we rarely play together. If you want encourage ppl to buy one switch per person atleast make that option solve all problems."
musicianmagic,"May 28, 2020",2,"ACNH be like log on, check which NPC is on the island (it’s probably Sahara), find a duplicate DYI on the beach, check the shops, find a cute accessory for a table you don’t have, show fossils to blathers (nothing new, ever), jock type says you look ripped today, close switch.

Villagers start getting passive aggressive when i talk to them more than one time in a day, I miss when they would ask me for a specific favors, or a fruit to get them, or schedule a time to come hang out at our houses.

If I have to abandon the game every two weeks until the next update it’s not an engaging game.

The fact that the jock villagers ONLY talk about working out gets old soooo quickly. Villager dialogue is so lame and repetitive that I barely talk to my villagers anymore. I just talk to the first 3 I see to get the nook miles and then carry on. Wasted potential, honestly.

Older games had much more dialogue and more personable. Booted up New Leaf the other day and Purrl randomly asked if I believed in UFOs or not. I miss that stuff.

Congratulations, $60 ACNH as achieved mobile f2p game engagement levels...

What’s sad is this game is being drip fed content; in New leaf by this time many could have a cafe be out hunting for gyroids, still seeing new furniture sets, out enjoying island mini games or diving around for water things..

New horizons feels lacking compared to new leaf..."

paigeegiap,"May 27, 2020",0,"My friend & I pooled our money to buy a switch & ACNH. It was the one thing I was looking forward to (& a major investment) after my life has been completely upended by the pandemic. To say that this is the most disappointing purchase of my life is an understatement. My friend started the game first, & I didn’t realize how much it **** to be the second player. I was basically plopped on her island (with Resident Services, Nooks Cranny, & the Museum already built) with a tent & no in-game instructions or prompts to do anything or what my overarching game goals were. I forged ahead, playing for 2 days looking up articles all the time to figure out how to do things. I finally came across other reviews & realized its not just me - it’s the entire 2nd player experience. I wish I had spent my money on groceries instead."

Only to find out when she had left I am unable to progress the storyline as I am not the ""citizen representative"". For the price of a triple A game to only have one ""shared"" save file is ruthlessly corrupt.

just_trev,"May 26, 2020",1,"Lifelong Nintendo-fan here. Can't even appropriately convey my disappointment with Nintendo for the One Switch, One Island rule. I expect things like this from EA but have never in my life encountered a move like this from Nintendo. My wife and I bought a Switch Lite to share together, and she was lucky enough to play Animal Crossing first. When I hopped on and had the slow realization that I would be confined to the Island she lived on unless I was willing to purchase a second console (not a second game cartridge, which I might have considered) my heart just sank. Nintendo really screwed the pooch on this one and from the other reviews I sense that they've already lost a lot of customers. Not that they care, apparently, as there is no news of change on the horizon. Gave it at least a one because it was fun watching my wife enjoy it, but now we both feel cheated."
Shtikesnest,"May 26, 2020",0,So I guess only one member of my family gets to play the game unless I buy everyone theit own individual Switch?  That's greedier than Activision.
Daisuk,"May 26, 2020",7,"By and large a good game, this, but it does get very repetitive, unless you love decorating - as that what it simply boils down to in the end. I played this lots more than I expected when it first came out, and was pleasantly surprised about that, but as soon as the ""story"" mode was over - the game was essentially over for me, there's very little incentive to real play any further unless you're really into decorating and getting lots of stuff. I personally don't know why everyone seem so bothered about which villagers they have - sure, they're charming up to a point, but I found them all incredibly shallow - very often repeating themselves, and offering little sense of the AI I expected seeing how attached some people seem to get to these characters. Overall, a positive surprise, but it does get very repetitive and boring eventually."
mikeroywave,"May 26, 2020",0,"Let me and my gf play on 2 separate save files. this is a clear attempt to sell more consoles rather then selling the experience of playing animal crossing. I really just wanted to make my own Island and do my own thing. I've never played any animal crossing and was looking forward to experiencing it on my own. I absolutely hate that I cannot make 2 separate save files and do things on my own. Worst $80 i ever spent. Neither my girlfriend nor I play anymore because we both wanted our own experience so we are arguing over every change. If we each had our own island this would be fixed in an instant. I don't even mind starting from scratch. I just want to make my own virtual ""Zen Garden"" without anybody elses influence or input. Especially as my first experience with the game. so disheartening and really just makes me wish I never bought the game."

Belgarion321,"May 25, 2020",9,"Well, as an Animal Crossing fan since Wild World times, I must say this last installment is quite the pinnacle for the saga. It is quite complete, from my opinion, and though it is not a revolutionary game for the saga, it evolves every game mechanic and adds a lot of new features. The personalisation introduced in New Leaf  goes into a new level, with the option of building your island from scratch, placing furniture outside the house, the paths... For the fans, all of these are great news. The Nook Miles system, although I do not personally see it as ""bad"", I found it a bit tedious (from a very personal point of view), but it helps to try to have like a daily routine in our island. You can spend hours and hours without notice, and that is a very positive thing to say.

About negative points, I must say I have little complains about this game. Maybe there are too few shops (compared to New Leaf) and the fact that we can only play the events (Easter, Nature Day...) during the real days (and after the final day, if time travel back, they are not activated again) are my main complains. And about the great amount of zeros due to 1 island per console, although is a thing  that can prevent someone from not giving this game a 10 (I include myself in this group), I think it is too exaggerated to rate it a zero. And with the fact that most of the users rating this game a zero are users which only rate has been this game, I think Metacritic should act and help to give this game a rate which really deserves (nor a 5.2, either a 10, possibly a 8.5-9).

In conclusion, buy this game if you have a Switch. Animal Crossing New Horizons must not be ignored if you want to have a complete Switch catalog."
Dreamare,"May 25, 2020",0,"When i ""attempted"" to play this game i was player 2... and all i gotta say is, what... the... literal... **** Why is there only 1 island per Nintendo Switch? Why does player 2 only exist to exist and nothing more? Why am i practically forced to **** the **** of someone i don't wanna play with when i just wanted to play ALONE? And why the hell did Animal Crossing on Gamecube have a better island system than the newest game on the Nintendo Switch? I would say something positive but i haven't been able to play the ****ing game, so uh... i can't."
Soulvei,"May 24, 2020",2,"The Good: Literally everything except...

The Bad: This has sparked actual screaming *fights* in my household because of the one island per Switch deal. Sharing is not usually difficult for us and my family shares the Switch all the time with other games. Watching someone play when it's their turn is fun to do. But one person getting creative license over a single island per Switch and not per account? What did you think was going to happen, Nintendo? Peace? Do you all live alone or do you think we all are going to shell out a couple thousand just to keep fights from breaking out over a bridge being erected or a beloved/bemoaned villager being ousted/invited? The game is meant to be a relaxing escape and it is... until the Island Rep breaks out Lloid to build an expensive incline to a cliff that goes nowhere or thinks it'd be hilarious to send Sprinkle packing because she's the villager someone else likes best.

It's a 5 star game. It gets 3 for literally inciting days long fueds. Days. Fix the single island thing, even if it means buying another cartridge or memory card like we did to get around this in previous versions. People will throw $60 at you five times for each family member to have their own control of their own island on the same console if you'd just let them. We'll do it. We clearly love this game franchise."
MiloArango10,"May 24, 2020",10,"This game can be easily categorized as the best Animal Crossing game that Nintendo has put out. The only inconvenience is the fact that there cant be more than one island per console, but personally I and my sister have found it to be a nice bonding experience. The aspects of growth and expertise are noticeable throughout your walkthrough, and rewards the player for building that community to its taste. An incredible game and a must-play for sure."

So much is happening in this world right now and all we needed was a calm, relaxing island escape, where we can live a carefree life, without having to worry about politics and economics. All we have to worry about on this island is how to decorate our home, design our own island and live our life to the fullest. I know it's just a game and I know that is has its faults and points of criticism, but in the end you are getting an experience. A game where you can sink hundreds of hours in and lose yourself in its beautiful graphics, jazzy music and tropical vibes. Welcome to your new deserted island getaway package."
Tmac718,"May 24, 2020",3,Playing 2nd fiddle to my 8 Year old daughter is a bit insane. Its not even the one island problem.  Its not a complete game.  I turned on the game appeared at an airport and am dropped off with almost no tutorials or quests. It is an incomplete experience for anyone that is not the first person to play the game. Thank God I don't have other children.  They should do something about this. I mean even purchasing a second copy of the game will not work around this. A simple DLC should be able to fix this broken concept  For players who have their own switch and are not in families will definitely have better reviews though. Its hard not to give it a zero unless you are the island creator

Also I wanted to play with my fiance, but 2 player ****. He doesnt want to play because I have already progressed so now he can't experience it from the beginning. Also when we wanted to play together the 2nd player cant do **** He was literally almost falling asleep because he just had to follow me around.
Plus when the animals talk they say the same thing every time each time you go see them.. this is very annoying and time consuming actually.
If you live by yourself and solely play single player it would be a great game. But in my situation I give it 1 star..."
Barium,"May 23, 2020",1,"Not allowing multiple islands per Switch is really a horrible move. Consider families with multiple children, they will not be able to play the game separately. And no, not everyone can afford a Switch per child. Horrible design choice, and completely unnecessary."

IamtheToph,"May 22, 2020",1,"Game is good in theory, it's fun during this time of COVID. However, and this is critically important, Nintendo treats its customers horribly. WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS?! Microsoft and Sony both have implemented sweeping and positive changes to their multiplayer and online capabilities. Nintendo refuses to listen to anyone. They are tone deaf and it's honestly offensive how dismissive they are of feedback. Quick to patch exploits but the fact that if my Switch breaks, which happens all the time due to their horrible hardware quality, you are screwed. This is an egregious miss on their part. Nintendo has to fix this or people will abandon this game in droves. Nintendo needs to grow up and get with the times before they become obsolete again."
Clockworkenergy,"May 22, 2020",0,"Big disappointment, this game is a glitchy unfinished mess. I feel so bad for the families that have to deal with the one save file per switch rule.

AlexxaLynn,"May 20, 2020",2,"Tldr: 2 stars because I LOVE this game, but the deal breaker of a problem I have with it could have easily been prevented with just the tiniest bit of forethought and whatever short amount of time it would have taken to add a warning message at startup of the game. Don't start playing on a shared device!

I've been obsessed with this game since I started playing a little over a week ago. I'd never even touched my husband's switch before, or another Animal Crossing game, so I had no idea that when he added me as a second player I would basically get to play one tenth of the actual game. It's probably a little dramatic, but I was devastated when I realized that I would never be able to progress the game on my own just because my husband made his account first. I really don't care about buying another console/game to have my own island, but the thought of doing that now after all of the effort/hours I've already put into the game makes me think I'm just going to give it up entirely. I really wish that at the very, very least there had been a warning when setting up an additional player on the game so I could have just bought a second switch before I got so far into it. This is the only problem I've found with the game, but it's a deal breaker to me and apparently a lot of other ACNH players. I've seen quite a few good suggestions of how to fix this, including adding the ability to switch between designated primary players or allowing the data to be transferred to another device via the  cloud storage. If you're going to make people buy multiple devices & games, don't pour salt in the wound by wasting their time too. Please warn future players in advance of what to expect as player 2+."
Kyleberry,"May 19, 2020",0,"ACNH focuses so much on creating a charming sandbox that it forgets to respect its players. Nintendo has yet to outgrow their penchant for text boxes / animations in extreme excess that serve only to waste your time, and multiplayer is a plane-infested disaster, sorely lacking meaningful ways to interact with others outside of an online economy sullied by time travel and hacking. Will consider changing rating to a solid 6 if Nintendo unlocks multiple islands per switch and drastically improves user experience. (Suggestion: multi craft/print/buy.) Unlocking the full range of island customization is sadly when the fun and desire to customize died; I'd value this game at $20 in its current state as a primarily single player game."

I enjoyed fishing and catching bugs in New Leaf.  But now the spawn rate is so low of any of the more challenging bugs and fish.

Marshall6,"May 18, 2020",0,"Angry about the one player feature that limits the game to a single person per console. I think this is unfair and there are ways that Nintendo could fix this and stop being so money hungry. I think at the very least players should not have a ""resident representative"" on an island. This makes it so only one player can make decisions and really do anything important on their island. I think this is wildy unfair considering that in order to fix this you would have to buy a second console which is just ridiculous. The switch is pricey enough as it is so it's only right that multiple people could play this switch exclusive game on a single console. Even though the rest of the game has good content, for people with kids who play or really anyone who wants to play with other people in their household, it's a huge problem. I'm reviewing so low in hopes to get ratings down so Nintendo will hopefully fix this problem."

However, once I get over that, this game is astronomically divine. It's calming and rewarding in a way that other games can't be. It has charm that can never be shaken. It has characters that you will adore and build long-lasting attachments to. It has the nerve to make chores desirable, and it has the special sauce that we all needed during this quarantine.

This is a game that was created with the highest amount of polish possible in this industry, but most importantly, it was made with an absolutely overwhelming amount of love & care, and it shows through and through"

Again, ignore all of the negative reviews! Those people are over-reacting and over exaggerating. If you want to play the game that bad just buy a pre-owned Switch Lite. Not that hard. Definitely an 1,000,000/10 game! Thank you, Nintendo for making this amazing and wonderful game!"
Jamzieze,"May 17, 2020",0,"Bought this to play with my wife. Couldn't seem to get advancement quests, then I found out online that I will never be able to, since my wife started the game first, and the island is now permanently her game, and I'm just there to grind resources for her quests. Read up on the Resident Representative restrictions. They are a disgusting cash grab where Nintendo wants you to buy a SWITCH per player, with their own copy of the game each, to get the BASIC experience of play. Unacceptable. **** Nintendo."
nintendoistrash,"May 17, 2020",0,"The Switch was largely marketed as a family console, but only one person in the household can have fun playing Animal Crossing because of the ridiculous 1 island per Switch restriction. Returned the game and the Switch. Screw Nintendo."
Whiplash3,"May 16, 2020",0,"Only allowing one island per console is so insane that it didn’t even cross my mind as something I would have to worry about when I bought the game. Every other game I can think of allows for multiple profiles/saves. It’s baffling. It would be cool to visit other locally created islands but still control your own. But instead everybody in a house has to be beholden to the game progress of the first person to play the game. The switch is a family console, yet only one person gets to enjoy the full experience of this game? It really just doesn’t make any sense to me."
Greeedo,"May 16, 2020",0,One island per switch is just greedy practice. Really shows that Nintendo only really cares about money. It is very disappointing that there is nothing we as individuals can do about it.
dr0nzer,"May 16, 2020",7,"never knew what the fuss was about with this game, it's pretty much a ""life"" simulator is the best way to describe it, it's alright but not my type of game. Bought to see what it was all about."
Tyhula,"May 16, 2020",9,"As a person who has only played 15 hrs of New Leaf and got bored of it, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an amazing game. I got to find out myself when people said that there are endless things to do and really you are the only limit realistically. The game is designed to be relaxing and calming, as well as interesting. There are many key things that I think people really click with in this game. The villagers, who all have a unique look and vibe to them, the clothing is amazing, with hundreds of clothing items to buy, you'll have a hard time finding just one perfect outfit, the island terraforming is a breath of fresh air to the series and is done in a simple and non complicated way. Nothing in this game feels off or out of theme. The difficulty curve is small, but part of the fun is learning along the way. The online play is really good, there are some things to fix, but for what it is, I think it's really nice. There is much more to say about the game, but overall it is fun and unexpectedly addictive, while being cute and simple at heart!"
robsterlobster,"May 16, 2020",0,"I played this game for a while and loved it, i probably put in 20 hours but I was struggling to advance the plot. I put in so much effort paying off debt and gathering resources and going to new islands to invite people to come live on my island and still nothing. Later I discovered I was missing a ton of recipes that the main player of the console also had. WELL! that was 20 hours wasted because apparently the second player on this game has no responsibility, can't advance the plot, is missing tons of craft recipes and is generally seen as a much less important player. I'm done with this stupid game and I can't believe I spent $60 on it. pisssseddddd

Edit: I deleted the game, started over as the main guy, played for a while...even at its best this game is boring and shallow. The characters are all cookie cutters and one dimensional, the items that you find and craft have very limited to no functionality, the game play is designed to be as tedious as possible. Still pissed I spent $60 on this game. **** Valley is 1/4 the price and 200 times better, thus it is 800 times better. Get **** instead."
ZIGtv,"May 16, 2020",9,"After almost two months of playing this, I can confidently say that this is an excellent game, and with the amazing sales, and the constant support for this title, that it will be one of the biggest titles in the Switches lifetime.

Pros:
The amount of detail put into it. For example, the museum, with its hundreds of fossils, fish and bugs.
There is so much to do, you’ll almost never get bored. There are tons of daily activities you do, and the game constantly encourages you to get that 5 star island **** seasonal events are mostly very fun(except for bunny day).There were only one or two moments around the end of the 130 hours I’ve played that I had nothing to do, but the next day when all resources re-spawn, you can do your daily chores, meet special characters, and do much more to try and improve your island. The sense of progression, and the feeling that everything on your island was made by you, feels great and rewarding. The online is pretty decent, and I like that you have a best friends list so that your best friends can help you and interact with your island more than strangers.

Cons:

The one island per console limitation is frustrating, since I tried playing with my friends locally, and it was very chaotic and confusing. If you’re buying this to play as a family, I would still recommend it, but only if everyone gets along well, and likes to work together. Some tasks in the game are a bit annoying to do, and the game starts off very slowly since to actually start the actual game and finish the prologue(which is everything before you get the upgraded resident services building),  takes  5-6 days.

Overall this is a great game that lived up to its hype, but for families who want to play together, the one island per console limitation is a huge turnoff. 9/10"
Reviewer2020,"May 16, 2020",0,The one island per console is ruining the game so bad. It is hard to create progress.
entitycat,"May 15, 2020",0,"Just got this game for my birthday. I was looking forward to playing it along with my brother until I found out about the 1 island per console feature. He's the one who started the game up so he's the primary player and I'm just a visitor on his island who can't contribute or progress the game in any meaningful way. I was extremely disappointed when I logged onto my account and saw the same island instead of an entirely new save file. The game would be a lot better without this blatant cash grab of a policy and I have to say I regret buying it. Don't bother wasting $60 if you share your switch, because to experience the game in full you'd need to fork over an additional $300 or so for a new switch plus another copy of the game. So basically $360 per island. Nice. The reason I rate it so low is to draw attention to this glaring issue. Not everyone is fortunate enough to just go out and buy as many switches as their heart desires."
Moemoe21,"May 15, 2020",0,Good game. But the fact that I cannot play my own game if my wife plays hers first is ridiculous.
Jabka229,"May 15, 2020",10,Best game 2020? actually i don't have nintendo switch but i have played it in my friend's. and I'll put 10/10
monks99,"May 15, 2020",10,People are giving this a zero just because they are mad that they can't have more than one island!  This game is one of the best switch games ever made.  If the people weren't so passionate about this game..they wouldn't be on here giving it a **** a zero is rediculous!!
Zezuca,"May 15, 2020",5,"I'm generously giving this a 5/10, because the gameplay is full of flaws and ages terribly.

This title's multiplayer ""feature"" is complete and utter garbage. First off, every single time a new player joins, a lengthy cut-scene (about 40 seconds) will display to EVERYONE on the island. Also, no one is allowed to use Nookphones or have a dialog while a new player tries to connect. Then, comes the biggest issue: the game DOES NOT SAVE while another person is visiting your island. Imagine you've been playing with your friends for one hour or so, and suddenly your connection fails (even a second is enough). Every player will be disconnected and ALL the progress made by EVERYONE in the last hour will be COMPLETELY ERASED Even the host will lose all the progress. The game only saves at two moments, when in multiplayer: when a player leaves or when someone arrives on your island.

Then, there are the crafting mechanics. Poorly thought and limited, you cannot craft more than a single item at once. If someone needs 15 fish bait, the player will need to craft fish bait 15 times, go through the lengthy dialogues 15 times and endure the cut-scene 15 times. This issue is somewhat fixable by having a Turbo controller.

What can't be fixed is the lack of recipes. I've only got one recipe a day by opening the bottles that come ashore, and a random villager will also gift you a random recipe once a day. I have got duplicates on many occasions. And that's about it for obtaining new recipes. You'll need a thousand years to complete the recipe list.

This game has a ton of new fishes and different species. But to get them all for your museum, you'll need to travel using Nook Miles Tickets. While those aren't particularly expensive, there's only about 1% of chance of visiting an island with different fish or bugs. I'm 70 hour into the game and NEVER managed to travel to an interesting island. Most of the times, players'll get sent into a small island that has the exact same resources as the home island. So, if you think exploration is a forte in this game, rethink.

Then comes the arbitrary limitations: players are not allowed to send more than two letters a day, cannot purchase or view custom designs when someone is visiting, cannot terraform when online, trading or giving fish or bugs in any way is not possible. Redd will only sell a single piece of art a week (original or false). Terraforming is full of limitations, such as not building waterfalls in a diagonal or leveling the edges of an island.

Building mechanics are mediocre. The house interior is very customizable, and player designs are very well used in the game. But the lack of crafting recipes and the Nook store's 4 itens a day limitation will cripple your creativity. There are nearly no counters or tables to furniture the house.

Getting attached to villagers is also not recommended, as they'll randomly move away, even if you talk to them everyday and create friendship bonds, the'll eventually leave you. I like to think that each villager is a tickling bomb, when their internal timers reach zero, they'll vanish from my island and a new random'll take up their space . There's also no getting around to this.

So, the good things: the graphics are really cute, well made and unique. The music is also very good, the new mechanics (although sloppy and poorly thought) are a welcome addition to the series. There has been some good quality of life improvements, such as inventory space and item catalogues. But all in all, the problems of this game overcome the improvements. And they have added interesting new content via updates, although nothing was game-changing.

I can only recommend this to VERY enthusiast newcomers into the series that have never played sandbox videogames before, or to die-hard Animal Crossing fans that are willing to swallow its many problems while paying 60 dollars for a clearly unfinished game that lacks a lot of polishing. Even though, a warning for those people: like Pokémon, this game has NO CLOUD SAVING. If something happens to your console or the save data gets corrupted somehow, your island is done for. Users cannot manually backup the save, because it's stored inside the console (not on the gaming card, not on the SD Card memory).

I have played this for about 70 hours, but the frustration with the lack of polish and overall unfinished or pre-test project feeling this game has is too much for me to keep on playing. I now seriously consider selling the cartridge to get something else. This game is nowhere as polished as Breath of the Wild, and its quality is substandard for a console-seller title. A lot of people will hop into ACNH because of the hype and, like me, will be frustrated when they realize this game ages like milk."
PoopmouthRon,"May 15, 2020",2,My wife set up the game so now I play the game on kid mode. Please add multiple save files.
Username11,"May 14, 2020",0,"Seemed like fun, and i was REALLY exited. Well, my mom got on the game first and selected an island, and now she owns the game, and the ONLY POSSIBLE GAME SAVE. i cant contribute ANYTHING meaningful to the game, other than collecting sticks and crafting things. She gets to make every decision on the island and my WHOLE family has to share this one island, and all of it's resorces. We ran out of stones to get iron & gold from. The couch co-op mode is terrible too. As a second player all of your items get directly sent to the ""town lost and found"" and anyone can take it out of the box, except for you, WHO COLLECTED IT. This would make sense if it was a 50 dollar consol or something that each person in our family could have but to spend 300 BUCKS to fully play a game on your own is ridiculous. So basically, i cant even play the game, i cant help move out island in the right direction, and i cant play an important role as a second player. And this is all on a 60 dollar game that my dad bought. Glad ONE person gets to enjoy it."
YoBoJosh,"May 14, 2020",0,"I swear fixing the problem with only 1 island would be so easy... Every other game has different users have different save files! Did Nintendo expect a family to have multiple switches?!?! If they did, then there would be no reason to have only 1 island. They thought it would be some cute little addition to the game for siblings to play on the same island. But that can’t be further from the truth. It’s like a full war, especially how resources can only be collected ONCE per day. Now, I agree that’s perfectly balanced and makes sense, but not when there’s siblings fighting over who gets the rocks or fruit or fossils. This whole thing, wouldn’t even be the worst thing ever, if everyone had the power of the resident representative! Like, my sister managed to log on first, and she barely even plays! But she plays enough that she won’t let me take over her account. So if I want to move a building, make a bridge, etc, I have to drop money, save, go on her account, build the thing, save, then go back on my account. It’s ridiculous! Why can’t the other players make bridges inclines layout changes etc. Not to mention only the main user can do the tasks to try to get K.K. on the island. Also the main user gets certain recipes that other users can not get unless they find it in a ballon gift thing. Besides the terrible terrible design, I like this game a lot and I can’t stop playing it. I just wish Nintendo would listen to the community and make this REALLY easy change."
kuehnau,"May 14, 2020",5,"It's Animal Crossing. It's always been Animal Crossing. And while they add some quality of life improvements to the game and some more polish, it's still pretty much the same game you've played since the DS era.

And the game still suffers from it's biggest drawback. Animal Crossing is a game that has no direction, it's about you personally finding stuff to do. And unfortunately, everything there is to do is the same mundane schlock you've come to expect from every other previous iteration of the game.

The ""mystery islands"" could have been a nice touch, but they are a quarter of the size of the normal island. Islands are picks from a small selection of pre-made islands instead of being procedurally generated. So instead of constantly finding new islands, after a weeks worth of playing the game, you'll begin to constantly see the same island types over and over again.

The developers made an attempt to give you more to do, but it ends up boiling down to being rewarded for doing the same stuff you have always done instead, while locking rewards behind ""Nook Miles"", a secondary form of currency in the game. The end result is, they've managed to already take a core mechanic from the game and turn it in to even more **** than it was before.

Animal Crossing's popularity isn't surprising; it was simply a coincidence, it managed to be released around the same time a massive pandemic was taking place. If it weren't for that, I doubt it would be getting such high accolades from people, because at the end of the day, this version is just as mediocre as any of the other releases.

For whatever insane reason, Nintendo has also decided to put in a bunch of really weird restrictions to the game that are ultimately unhelpful, frustrating and counterproductive to what a game should be.

Animal Crossing needs to be BETTER, not the same."
jordanm5,"May 14, 2020",0,"do NOT buy if you share a switch with anyone. only one island per switch and only ONE person can progress the game. nintendo lost all respect on this one, greedy company hates their consumers"
Random22,"May 14, 2020",4,"Anima crossing new horizons is a good game but it has a big problem. The fact that you can only have a island per switch is pretty bad for the ones that can't buy another nitendo switch and have siblings that are interested in play the game alone, that includes me and my brother. I really hope that nitendo fix this issue because it's the only problem that i see with this game."
ROflows,"May 14, 2020",9,"*Just to start, I played the game as a solo player and thus will score it based on what I experienced.*

A very fun island creation game with many possibilities. It is a very addicting game, with so much potential. It is beautiful and rewarding for those who wish to create their own little escapes. Probably the most annoying thing for a solo player would be Island Designer's slow progression.

As I played by myself, obviously I did not have the problems with additional players; however, that is really frustrating that people would have to deal with that issue by purchasing another console."
TheWiseCherokee,"May 14, 2020",0,Only one island per console?????  That’s not going over well with my kids and I’m not about to buy each of them a switch simply so they can have their own islands to enjoy. Wish I could get a refund.
hirundo,"May 14, 2020",10,"Amazing game, true to the classics and beautiful to boot. I feel like this game was made for the Lite, an on the go world that you can check for a few minutes at a time on your commute (or play for hours while at home). The regular updates have been so good as well!"
shaemarie,"May 14, 2020",0,Bought this game for my kids to play and I'm fuming that they can't each play on their own islands on their own account.  Each subsequent player is extremely limited by the first player and they get a watered down experience.  So dissappointed.
Cronch,"May 14, 2020",2,"I can definitely say that the game is extremely enjoyable. It’s very nice to sit down to on yet another day at home, and it kept me coming back each day. That is, of course, until I discovered that I couldn’t change the island representative. By then I was already too far into the game. I enjoy playing with the real time aspect of Animal Crossing so when it’s taken more than a month to get where I’m at on my own account, along with being forced to also progress another player that my brother no longer uses, it makes me furious to see that every solution I try to turn to says the same thing: if I want to become the island representative I have to delete the entire game’s save data. It’s simply impossible for me to do that after putting all this time into a game that I really truly love. It’s a shame that I can’t enjoy it any further after all my hard work."
Halpocus,"May 14, 2020",10,"Beautiful game with lots of things to do. You can see the progress your Island makes and all the different animals with their own personalities, all the furniture you can buy and place in your home is truly something for video game lovers. Visiting other islands is really fun aswell as calling animals to come to your island. 10/10 would buy again."

Never in my life have I seen a game where you can’t have save files for different users, and I think it’s atrocious to believe that people will shell out the money for a second console just to play it separately. That is not how a game should work. I shouldn’t be limited to what other people I play with are doing, and vice versa. That’s not truly creating my own island, which is the whole appeal of the game. Nintendo, fix this. NOW."
Fjanua,"May 12, 2020",2,"As primary user, I'd give this game a 3. As secondary, I would give a 1. First 10 hours of the game are exciting and filled with possibilities but the pace slows significantly as you run out of things to discover. Unless you like designing and organizing, it's unlikely you'll spend more than 20 minutes per day paying. Absolute biggest mistake was only allowing 1 island per switch. The entire point of this game is gathering resources and collecting. When you have to share your resources with someone else the game becomes pointless and a waste of money. I dont see any good reason for this rule, to me it's unfathomable for a company to have such a brainless flaw."
Carlitosssss,"May 12, 2020",0,To the buffoons who thought making this game damn-near inaccessable to a second account on the same console: congratulations you have utterly and completely screwed the pooch.

Now imagine our disappointment at the realization that one of us would get a complete game while the other would get a slap in the face and a note that said: thank you for your money idiot! I will make it my life's priority to disparage this game in front of anyone who dares mention it. I will spit fire and hellstone at the person who dares glorify this fart parade **** for I can accept a video game company trying to make money off my stupidity but I will not accept a game company making money off their own stupidity.
acicali,"May 12, 2020",0,"This is truly bittersweet. I'm unable to even purchase this game because of the development decisions regarding one island per-console. We have a Nintendo Switch because it's a family console. I play as a parent, and several of my children also play. We have 4 joy-cons as well as *many* games. We will not be purchasing Animal Crossing because we do not wish to choose who gets to play it and who gets to ""not play"" it secondarily. If a future update resolves this issue, count us in."
Lryan01,"May 12, 2020",2,"This game is fun if you don’t want to play with anyone else. If you have more than one person who wants to play it’s a nightmare. If you choose to buy this game get a physical copy, if it drives you crazy there are no refunds from Nintendo eshop. I’m so disappointed. I really liked it until I realized its really only meant for one person to have the full experience. Oh, and the multiplayer is horrendous. Only the ‘leader’ is able to do anything meaningful while the other players mostly just run around with them. The non leader cannot even pick up items."
jnlu,"May 12, 2020",1,why  can only the very first player who went on the island  run errands for the racoon(?) and  get the necessary DIY functions for free other players on the same island have to buy the functions by bells and don't  know how the island is going on unless the first player told them
Dclose38,"May 12, 2020",1,When using multiple accounts only the primary account has access to certain game functions. This slows the progress for every other account since the game only allows one island per device.

JuicyPrimeRibs,"May 12, 2020",0,"Don't get me wrong the game is good but the whole idea of having different islands on the same switch was a bad idea. My brother and I really wanted the game and we were about to pay somewhat half half but then we realized that only one person can be the island representative and the other person is just a slave for materials. My brother said he could wait for the game to eventually add that feature of more than one island on a switch and I feel really bad for him. Nintendo, if you see this. Please just update it.

ZippyR,"May 12, 2020",2,"I really wish I could give this a better review. If the save system was like any other game where multiple users could have their own island, then it would be a 9. But forcing people to share islands is disappointing to say the least. Instead of being able to collect resources like every one else, you’re forced to compete for resources, thereby slowing everyone’s progress. Additionally, unless you’re the person to create the island you’re treated as a second class citizen who doesn’t get to help out with any of the projects that progress the island. At one point you have to build furniture and decorations for 3 villagers, but only the Resident Representative can see what’s needed, let alone turn them in. You can work together to build the items and give them to the RR, but that’s more cumbersome than it should be.

If my daughter hadn’t used her allowance to buy a digital copy then I’d look into returning it. But she’s 7, and loves the game, so I wouldn’t do that to her even if it was possible to return digital copies of games.  Of course, since she bought it she gets to be the Resident Representative, so of course she loves it."
MBsnowman,"May 12, 2020",1,"Bought the game for siblings. Getting them to take turns at all is an achievement, so upon finding out that only one person can progress the story made this an immediate fail. I understand that there has to be some restriction in place to curb cheating and self-selling, but this can't be the way. I'm not sure we'll even keep playing it now.  Hoping the developers will hear the unhappiness and allow at least two islands per system."
littlestfinch,"May 12, 2020",9,"Yes multiplayer is dumb. Yes it is lacking a cloud save. Yes it does **** to not be the first person on the island. I am fortunate enough to be the only player in my household so dealing with some of the issues above isn't something I have to do. Aside from visiting folks from the active and delightful community around the game.

My first animal crossing was ACNL which I loved despite some of it's QoL issues. ACNH addresses many of those issues and adds fun mechanics that keep me returning daily. I've sunk a shameful amount of hours in since launch. Although I've slowed considerably, I still log on daily to do some digital chores. I love my little island."

lukinho,"May 11, 2020",1,"I can´t believe the one campaign per console limitation. This is the biggest disappointment I had in any 60 dollars game ever. I did not know about it when I bought it, why would it be like that? Never saw that before. Anyway, the game can have a really nice gameplay, but it wont be a game until this is fixed, which I think wont. Total scam, Nintendo."
CherryPie,"May 11, 2020",1,"My sibling and I bought the Animal Crossing Special Edition switch consoles just to play Animal Crossing. We knew we had to share an Island, so I was the second player and played for a few hours until I realized that the first player gets to do everything and experience events, while the second player has no decisions on the island and is inferior. As I don't see any point in playing with an inferior character, I just deleted my character and let my sibling play the game on their own. If they allowed the second player to have the same responsibilities as the first player or allowed 1 island per game cartridge, I would have bought another game cartridge to play (which would also be a profile for Nintendo), but no, Nintendo wants us to buy separate consoles. Nintendo is very money hungry. I have the money and can buy my own switch, but I refuse to support such greedy actions as there are other families that can't afford to buy a switch for each child. I guess I will go back to my PS4."
Bigpoppa24,"May 11, 2020",0,"Hi,
Great game, I love it, but... I don’t get why there is only one island per console??? I don’t think  anyone would have the money for that many Nintendo switches, I know the past games haven’t gone so well in some countries but that’s no reason to make it only one island!? It is the only reason that this game is not the best game. If you fix this in the next update, I bet even more people would want to buy it!

From Milla. 8 years old. I cried because my mummy didn’t get to have her own island."
Halloo,"May 10, 2020",0,Zero zero **** can only have one island that all the profiles on the switch has to play on. That means no one can have their own island. Only one person (the one that owns the island) can make decisions. I bought the game expecting my daughter's to be able to make their own island and everyone can do their own **** was I mistaken. Basic functionality is missing which is very surprising.
InfernoDragon3D,"May 10, 2020",1,"Seeing as Nintendo decided to completely screw up bug spawn rates and nerf the interest rate instead of patching in much needed Quality of Life updates, I am left with little to no enjoyment of this game. At this point, I only play out of obligation and I'm astonished with how they released this in the state that it's in. It is abundantly clear that New Horizons was released in an unfinished state, seeing as there are straight up omissions of features and items that were in New Leaf, and plenty of rookie mistakes that seriously should've been spotted in the testing phase but were left unfixed. Such as the lack of bulk crafting, ability to take materials from storage while crafting, the list goes on.

When there is a fanmade video that shows the kind of QoL changes that could be in this game, you know that the devs did not take the time to fine-tune the game before release. I'm aware a lot of people are glad the game is out with current world events happening as of now, but that should never excuse that the game has problems that should be addressed and that the players should at least be notified that there will be some kind of QoL update down the line. Instead, they go and just screw with the bug spawn rates, just making it harder for people to catch them for no good reason; and even go around and heavily reduce the interest rate to only a maximum of 9,999 bells. Something which was not needed in the slightest and it's an enigma of how they thought that was okay to even consider.

Not to mention the multiplayer is a complete joke when sharing a console with others and online multiplayer is just as bad with mounds of text form Orville to just connect online and even then, Nintendo's netcode is still just as lousy as always.

All in all, Animal Crossing New Horizons is a game that has massive potential, but is held back by a tidal wave of problems and lack of QoL from releasing unfinished. As such, this is the worst game in the series, and I cannot in good faith recommend this game which **** coming from someone who adores this series and just wants to see the best for it and this new entry. Hopefully, later updates address and fix the myriad of problems and turn New Horizons into the worthy entry that it should be."
MuffpuffZeBuff,"May 10, 2020",8,"Hot damn I didn’t realize how many people share a switch in their household.

While yes, the one island per console is sad and warrants loosing a few points, the game is otherwise exactly what you expect from the series. The graphics look great on the switch and are bright and fun with a beautiful island setting, the characters are friendly and cute, and the gameplay is the generic collection and fetching of items that make up animal crossing.

Story there isn’t anything to say as it is mostly just a tending to the island and it’s inhabitants sim, but you don’t buy these games for a gripping story. Basically if you like animal crossing you will like this game unless you have ants in your pants about not being able to share on a console."
brangers,"May 10, 2020",0,"An excellent game, ruined by Nintendo'a multiplayer failure both local and online.

With local multiplayer, you can only have one island per CONSOLE and if you aren't the first to play, you won't be the island ""representative"" which means that you are restricted on contributing to the island development and later, having no control over where bridges and elevations are built as well as relocating shops and other people's houses.

Online multiplayer is a joke where you spend more time frozen, waiting around 60 seconds every time someone enters or leaves the island, only to be frozen again 2 seconds later when another person enters or leaves.

Great game if you are the first to play and don't want to play online, otherwise give it a miss."
Dvtn,"May 10, 2020",0,"Me and my sister bought this game to play with (but with our own islands each) our other littler sister.  We let her start up the game, and a few hours later, realized we could not have our own islands.  After 5 minutes of finding out the things I couldn’t do, I quit.  Possibly the worst decision made by Nintendo in. Along time.  To make a family friendly, family oriented game impossible for families to enjoy together.  I’m hoping for Nintendo to see this so they change it.  My sister has tons of fun and am happy she is, but am furious that I can’t do the same."
Jamesberry143,"May 10, 2020",0,As a person who is a longtime Nintendo fan and supporter I can’t stand behind The ugly cash grab that is ACNH. This is a game that wants to frustrate you to the point that you will go out and spend an additional 360$ for a new Switch and another copy of animal crossing. Not only is the one island representative bad enough. Couple that with extremely limited couch co op where second player doesn’t have access to do anything other than chop trees and watch logs Poof to the recycle bin. Made miserable by the fact that you have to leader swap and go nick them up if you actually want to retrieve them. I’m sorry but until this is fixed in my opinion this game is absolute trash and have no desire to play. Bought this title to play with my wife and daughter. As a longtime gamer I thought I would be able to find work around for the current problem and is is possible but so completely tedious that it completely ruins the experience for me. Nintendo’s already got my money and probably the money of several thousands of people just like me. So I really doubt Nintendo is going to fix their stupid cash grab. This game could have been a masterpiece instead it is a Dumpster fire
Scoose,"May 10, 2020",2,"This game is a shameless cash grab by Nintendo to sell more consoles. To get the full experience, a second cartridge won't work, you need to buy a whole new console. The first player experiences the full game, additional players get to see what the first player chooses to do.

Nintendo did this knowing the game would be popular and could potentially boost console sales. They might not care about one customer, but I will not be purchasing another thing by Nintendo unless this gets fixed."

The fact that you need to pay 10$ monthly to visit friends or ever send them gifts etc is almost as bad as the whole deal with the first person who plays the game is the one who decides everything in the game.
I also think the villagers dialoge is fairly week. It's apperant quickly if you have two of one character type on the island, and it gets old quick. There are more things I can bring up, but these are the ones that bring down my enjoyment the most"
Lanmate,"May 10, 2020",0,First time playing Animal Crossing... after watching my partner play I wanted to as well. Quickly discovered I'm limited in what I can do as the second person on the island and promptly stopped playing.
Kotorichan,"May 10, 2020",0,"The UI is annoyingly inconvenient and conversations with villager are repeating and empty. The fact that tools frequently break without any notification is also irritating.

Many furniture is reduced from previous New Leaf. Furthermore, despite the ""remake"" option in DIY, most of the furniture with colour variation is not remake-able. There are about 6 colour types for all furniture, but a single player can collect only one type of them on their own. To get the colour that you don't have, you have to do multiplayer which again is so inconvenient mainly because of 1-minute freezing time inserted each time when a player joins to an island.

Furthermore, although this game is advertised to enjoy the multiplayer, there aren't many things to do online except trading furniture or selling turnip (online mini-games existed in New Leaf is now gone). Not to mention that other systems that were available in previous games, such as town ordinance and haniwa, are now deleted.

But the graphic is ok considering it is animal crossing."

I can't believe critic reviewers called this game ""family-friendly"" when clearly only one member of the family can enjoy this game. Now it is possible to buy a second switch, but now they cost $500 because of the shortage. This is by far the most restrictive game I've ever played."

I understand the deal-breaker of the sharing system and just 1 island per Switch. That may be a huge deal-breaker for a lot of folks."
gorgonzolon,"May 9, 2020",0,"I was so disappointed with this game. It was so exciting with all the new features and the amount of control you have over the island, as well as the option for local multiplayer. I'm the eldest of 3 siblings and we share a switch, but they can't play the way I play at all. Like everyone is saying, this is the dumbest idea Nintendo could have possibly come up with. I'm sure they want to sell more switches but not everyone can afford to spend 400 dollars just to play the new animal crossing game. Shame on you, Nintendo.

That's not even all of it, the gameplay itself is atrocious. Put aside the 1 island per switch issue and you're left with a game that uses up half of your playtime in menus you can't speed up. At least in New Leaf and such you had the option to skip through dialogue with (B) and not have to sit there button mashing for a good 30 seconds just to go to Tortimer's island, for example. The crafting would be SO fun if it wasn't so tedious.

I was also excited about the path system! That was something we desperately needed but the way it works is really infuriating when you just want your island to look neat. Having grassy gaps and not being able to fill in spaces under or around structures... it boils me alive. I know I'm nitpicking at this point, but they made Animal Crossing for the switch. It should pride itself in a little more polish and playability."
AngryEnough,"May 9, 2020",1,"One island per console?? Are you joking? This is absolutely absurd. Whoever made that decision is either a senseless idiot or a malicious ****. This is a great game with an even greater, crippling flaw. This is a family console we're playing on, folks, not a Gameboy."

Tautou,"May 9, 2020",0,I puchased a switch for my household to play this game. As a second player on animal crossing I cannot do any meaningful progression in the island. This is such an odd decision by the developers and would have to give a rating of 0 for an unplayable game.

Canthony,"May 9, 2020",3,The inability to have multiple islands on the console make this game useless for families.
tzted,"May 9, 2020",2,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you have more than one person who wants to play this on the same Switch.

Animal Crossing (AC) continues with it's tried and tested formula of grind materials to make things to sell in the grind for bells (Capitalism at it's best).  In the words of Tod Howard, it just works.  And that's fine, this game has and will always be, a grind.  MMOs thrive off this and so does AC.  And for Player 1, AC ties in some thin story to help make the grind feel like an achievement.  For ANY other player, you're stuck in an endless loop of grind WITHOUT any story.

For additional Players (do remember that Nintendo have a ONE ISLAND per Switch policy), there is no story and so no achievement reward for improving the island and so you're forced into essentially a glorified Fishing Simulator.  Craftable items that are locked to the story, yeah, Player 1 will have to craft them and give them to the additional players (some of these do appear in the shop once unlocked, but not all).

It screams cash grab from Nintendo, forcing parents to purchase multiple Switch devices for the warring kids over who should be Player 1 and get the full AC experience or be relegated to a Player controllable NPC.  For the price of another Switch plus the game, I can see why Nintendo would be rather slow to patch this as the longer it goes, the more devices they'll likely sell.

My suggestion is, as the first line says, NintenDON'T buy this game if you share your Switch.  If you're a lone Switch Wielding Warrior, then I can recommend this to a point.  As others have said, there should be two scores for this title, as 2 is a bit low for the single player experience.  However, it is advertised as a Multiplayer game, which it clearly is not.

Still looking for a time consuming build up your own unique world?  I can fully recommend **** Valley as Eric ""ConcernedApe"" Barone has really gone up and above with this title and won't leave anyone feeling left out, relegated to generic tasks."
DrThunder,"May 9, 2020",2,This game is enjoyable but is unbelievably frustrating when you can't even get 30 iron ingots to build a shop or you have to work your tail off for weeks and weeks and it's so frustrating to play some days  And it's like how do I progress when I feel so Stark and so  Abandoned.

CDRMac,"May 8, 2020",3,"The basic concept is fun and addictive.

HOWEVER, the co-op and multiplayer is ATROCIOUS!

1. We bought the game mainly so my wife, son, and I could play co-op. We were so excited to travel together and explore other people's Islands. TOO BAD. For some nonsensical reason, that is not allowed. Couch co-op is ONLY allowed on your island. And on top of that, the options for players 2, 3 & 4 are drastically limited. So much missed potential with this feature.

2. Only the first character to be created (the Island Representative) can travel to other islands online. I made my character 2nd, and I cannot travel online. It tells me I need to buy an additional Nintendo Online subscription. That means that if I am playing my character, I am pretty much stuck on our island. Why would Nintendo do this? Why should I need two online subscriptions for one game, on one Switch? I can't think of any logical reason to do this. Seems like blatant greed, to me.

Games released a decade ago have had more robust multiplayer than this. I just don't understand how, in the year 2020, a company as experienced as Nintendo can do such a poor job on such an important feature.

I see that I am not the only one complaining about these features. I hope Nintendo listens to its fans, and fixes them in the near future."
SammyHauguth,"May 8, 2020",1,"Turnip price is always less then what I paid for turnips... It's 66 today, and I paid 99...

How am I gonna make bells? When there is no way in doing so?"
Wobs,"May 7, 2020",2,"Perhaps i am being to harsh on the game and went in with high expectations. I have never played an Animal crossing game up to this point but i played **** valley and thought it was pretty great. While playing it i would get onto web forums and that is where i heard a lot about animal crossing and how it was the game that started these types of games. Some people would even say they were playing **** valley while waiting for the coveted  animal crossing new horizons game.  I got into the hype and i felt like Nintendo was on a role with their in house games so i pre-ordered it for me and my wife.

Here is the reasons why i am disappointed with the game.

1. All the profiles on a switch play on the same island. At first this sounded interesting and it felt like our house would have its own community. What makes this annoying is that you are on an island with finite daily resources so if my wife plays before me she could take most of the resources on our island. Granted I could spend nook miles to go to a random island to get resources but it was really disappointing searching the island for leftovers.

2. This First person to play the game can impact the progression of everyone else playing. This person becomes the island representative and they get assigned objectives that lead to the islands growth. I let my wife play first and I found my self waiting her to build some buildings and could not participate the same way. My profile can only do the side objectives. It felt like the idea of there being two people playing the game on one the same switch was an after thought. Or a greedy money grabbing attempt from Nintendo.

3. Most craftable items are just decorative. In games like the sims, minecraft, and  **** Valley you had decorative items but also a lot of items the are functional. Like a stove to cook food or a bike to make you travel faster. In animal crossing I made a bike and a stove and they just sit there and I can't use them. It makes crafting kind of boring because you don't create something useful. I have an interior design app on my phone and it feels kind of like animal crossing.

4. Social media seems to be a big part of this game. One of the cool things about this game is that your island is unique and what grows on your island does not nessarly grow on a friends island. For example Apples grew on my island and peaches grew on my sisters island. In order to get different  resources you either need to get extremely lucky and find them on a mysterious island or trade with a friend. If someone is your friend on the switch you still have to friend them in animal crossing. It is independent of your switch friends. The best way to trade is to get on social media or forums.  This would not be so annoying if switch had a mic built into the console. Instead I found myself having to type everything out. What made it more annoying is that my wife (the island rep) did not have switch online for her account. So the person who had the most important role could not do online trading. If you are going to force us to share an island then this island should have a shared subscription. I started getting bored because i was not the representative but my account was online so i had to do the trades.

5.Multiplayer is not that fun. Couch co -op is in the game, but to play it you need to have a profile and a character made on the island . For couch co-op the second player is forced to follow the first player and can not keep any resources. In Online multiplayer you can't do things like move decorations while someone is visiting your island. Online players can keep the resources they take from your island.

6.Lack of goals. It wants to be like minecraft in this aspect and wants you to choose your own path. Minecraft is massive with so much to explore and learn about, animal crossing is small and most island feel the same. **** Valley is also small but you can explore with crafting and i remember  gathering resources just to see what a crafted item does. In animal crossing the most exciting things are a new visitor, a large fish shadow, or a bug that can attack you. It just does not have enough different things for me to do or learn about to care or get lost in.

**** relationships do not really feel like they progress. I don't feel like my npc's see me more as a friend than when they first came. Npcs with the same personality they start to get repetitive in conversations. Don't get me wrong there are some interesting things that they do but it seems few and far between.

8. The real time can be annoying when joined with the problems above. Basically i play the game at night after my wife and the nook shop closes. You can put stuff in a box to sell but you get penalized and lose 20%. It is annoying because when you start the game the shop is open 24/7.  If you work late you might be inconvenience by this game.

Overall it feels like a grind for both me and my wife."
BitBit99,"May 7, 2020",0,"No options, crafting own item at a time, 50% of the game is dialogue you’ve gotten over 1,000 times. Even when digging up fossils, which all look the same before identifying them. Playing with friends is a pain, and more importantly there’s nothing to do with your friends. They see your island and pick fruit with you and that’s it. One game per console, not profile, means only one person can play period. Others can switch profiles, but if they aren’t the main account it’s not their island. The game honestly feels like it’s a beta. Very rushed, poor UI, and little to no potential growth for the game as it stands. Nintendo already has my money don’t let them take yours. You’d be better off with Zelda or Mario at least those don’t force you to click a button through repetitive dialogue when you’ve dung up the same fossil or catch the same ladybug 50+ times. This is more than enough justification for my rating. Thanks for reading."

010101010100,"May 7, 2020",1,"Pretty fun game. I would give it a 10/10. However, as much as I'm enjoying this game, not being able to play on the same console with someone else and have their own game is unacceptable. If every profile can't play the game normally, they shouldn't charge a ""normal"" price for it. Having only one island to me at least lowers the value to like a $35 game tops, not a $60. The other big problem I have is how tedious they have made simple things. Why do I have to restart every conversation if I either change my mind or want something different. It would not be a problem if there was a way to make all of the text appear on the screen at once. It takes almost a whole minute of Orville rambling just to type in a dodo code, and if you mess up, that island's full, etc, you have to wait through another 30 seconds of dialogue just to leave, and if you want to use a different code, you must sit through that minute convo again.  For a game that almost requires visiting people either locally or online (can't get all fruits otherwise) that is stupid. You want 3 of the color variants of one piece of clothing? well, too bad. You have to go in and out of the dressing room because you can't buy more than one outfit at a time. Also, Home storage should be considered when crafting in your house. I have to open inventory, take what I want out, close inventory, craft, and then put everything back. The UI is not well thought out. I understand it's ""realistic,"" but I don't consider the airports being a pain in the *** and vendors who won't **** to be something that a game needs. They have either lost their minds and don't realize how tedious this was before even releasing the game (Do you playtest), or they just didn't care. either of the two is ridiculous, especially for a globally-established company."
Thepokemon,"May 7, 2020",10,"This game is incredibly well designed. The game play is fun and lighthearted. I and my family all have copies of the game (5 in total) and we all have our own island. This requires everyone to have their own switch or switch lite, but it has really helped us to stay connected especially during this Corona virus period of time in our lives. The game itself is rather simple and straight forward, every day you login, cut trees, fish, find fruit, craft recipes and pay off (albeit slowly) your debt to Tom Nook."

This should be changed, but as long as it stays the same this game is not worth it for more than one person."
SwitchMom,"May 6, 2020",0,"This is a super fun game.  I enjoy.  My son enjoys it.  The problem (and it is a huge problem) is that you can only have 1 island per switch and the person who created the island is effectively the only one who can really make any decisions about the island.  In my house, we have 2 switches, but there are four of us who would like to play animal crossing.  That leaves 2 people very upset and for me, drops this game all the way down to one star for all the problems it creates in my house.  It is frankly ridiculous that I would need to buy four switches so each member of my family could enjoy the game.  Moms beware."

AV_Lazy,"May 6, 2020",8,"I feel like ACNH is a game thats quality varies depending whether you have one or multiple people playing on one console. I'm the only one that uses my switch so my game is really good. I have enjoyed it a lot and there's a lot of stuff to do. I have only had it for about 10 days but I've already sunk at least 25 hours into it. The game does have it's flaws though, with stuff like the one island per console controversy, the Switch Online app isn't very good with it, no hourly music before you unlock the resident services building, etc which is why I can't really rate it higher than an 8"

FreshChef,"May 6, 2020",0,One island limit means you get a watered-down game with no substance if you're not the first player. I really hope they change this so I can actually enjoy the game to its full potential.
soazeros,"May 6, 2020",0,"I wish i could go back and not get this game.  Its 'leader' system coupled with its 1 island per console has this game collecting dust 5 days after purchase as my family members one by one give up out of boredom, no ability for secondary players to advance the game, only do chores. Big freaking whoop.  The leader is then left with all the grind.  Having to collect so many resources and get out of so much island debt leaves the leader unable to pursue their own ambitions.  This game is so lifelike in a bad way that it leaves me dreading it like i dread my real mortgage.  Nintendo will not likely fix or patch or update this, don't hold your breath.  If this game was 20 or 30 dollars, i'd have written an entirely different  review.  I expect full capability for ALL my family members when i buy a game at full market price."

saad0,"May 6, 2020",8,"The art style and design of characters and objects have always complemented each other in this franchise, the contrast between the life-like fish, fossils and bugs and the chibi-like villagers and animals greatly appeals to the eye. One thing that keeps bugging me about this game is the lack of character development between the player of the game and his neighbours. In older Animal Crossing games, your animal neighbours were strangers, and as strangers would act, they wouldn't instantly like you or be instantly gratuitous towards you. This made them personified in a way, they were more characteristic and the bond you formed with them felt more real. However, in this game, although the villagers are more expressive and DO more  natural things, they FEEL almost robotic in the ways they act towards you, they say the same things, they feel the same way. It doesn't feel like they are truly happy when they are, or when they're angry, or when they're sad. But, even with that in mind, this game is still an amazing experience

Nintendo, make the characters more characteristic. Please.

It has gone from Life Sim (+Collectathon)
To Collectathon (+Life Sim)

Anyways, I gotta get back to playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf on my Nintendo 3DS."

PewPewMcP,"May 5, 2020",10,"This game is made of crack, I enjoy long 100 hour JRPGs, and I've spent more time on this game in two months than I did half a year last year playing Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Dragon Quest XI combined. I really enjoy the freedom afforded to us in designing our islands, I terraformed mine pretty hard and ended up with a pretty sweet island. Visitors love it! The community at large is pretty sweet, so my online multiplayer experience has been pretty good so far, but it seems that you shouldn't share accounts on a same switch, which is definitely a glaring weakness. Overall I highly recommend. It's been likened to the Lego Duplo version of Minecraft, which I can't deny."

Lookie,"May 5, 2020",9,This game is great and people are salty you can only have one island per console. I will take a point off because there isn’t much to do in the late game but otherwise it is everything you’d come to expect from a modern animal crossing game.
rlosey13,"May 5, 2020",10,"This is by far the best Animal Crossing title in the franchise! The world looks great, the villagers are bright and cheerful, and terraforming is very addicting. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a relaxing life-sim."
Shiv12,"May 5, 2020",1,"I would love this game ... if I was the one who actually got to play it. It was supposed to be a fun and relaxing game during quarantine that instead turned into a domestic dispute because I failed to do the research that only ONE user gets to have an island and every other user gets to be a second class citizen on said island. I bought the game but my roommate played it before I had the chance to and doesn’t understand why I’m upset. I just get to be the jerk who’s bad at sharing, when really there is absolutely no reason why Nintendo can’t allow for separate islands for separate user profiles. Heck, I’d buy a separate copy of the game to have my own island if that would solve it. But my roommate isn’t going to buy her own Switch, so I’m just stuck being the angry jerk who wasted $60. Do better, Nintendo."
thesharing,"May 5, 2020",1,"The game itself contains a lot of fun. However, there are plenty of conflicts in this game. First, it encourages players to play with their friends. But the experience of visiting friends is just like UPS: slow, complicated operations, and unstable connections. When you disconnect with your friend, all of you will lose your progress. When you try to reconnect, the long, **** conversation will drive you mad over and over again. Second, the game is set to be one island per console. But if you lost your switch, or broke it by accident, well, congratulations, you would lose all the time you waste on this game. This is hilarious. Also the local multi-player experience is just like sharing the toilet with your partners. It could happen, but we all wish that it should never happen. So be it."

I merely want my girlfriend to have the same privileges I do on them game, representative or not."
YoungerReviewer,"May 5, 2020",7,I was very excited for this game and when I got it I was hooked. But that feeling only lasted a few weeks and after that I put down the game and didn't pick it back up. Enjoyed it but thought the wonderful experience would last longer. Eventually you'll get bored.
Goombafan333,"May 4, 2020",0,"Imagine an Animal Crossing game with tons of furniture and endless replayability.
You just imagined New Leaf.
Because this game doesn't have anywhere near the amount of content as previous games.
New Horizons makes the Gamecube original look as expansive as Skyrim with how dull and empty the game feels.

You have 1 person who can have fun per copy of the game
The other 7 are just NPCs who can't edit the island in any possible way which is the games single most defining feature."
AskAtlas,"May 4, 2020",3,"I have played Animal Crossing New Horizons and New Leaf, and while New Horizons is a decent game for simple improvements to the ways of game mechanics, it remains imperfect in the aspect that you still have to grind through dialogue to do quality-of-life things like crafting fish bait. However, as I said, it still is better in that aspect over previous installments as your materials automatically stack. Aside from that simple gameplay adjustment, I honestly believe New Leaf, which was on the Nintendo 3DS is better than this Nintendo Switch title. My reasons?

New Leaf put you in a role where you have an entire city at the mercy of your ordinances and it truly felt like you were making a difference in not just your mayor chair, but in the virtual lives of your villagers, whom will occasionally ask you to run errands or generally ask your opinion on something. Sure, New Horizons has the later of that statement, but you can play the entire game and not care about whether a villager leaves because it is very apparent that they are no different than interacting with AOL back in the day. I have told Nintendo these recommendations, but they have yet to listen. I told them that they should re-add the island fruit/tortimer Island/minigames back into the series, considering you are on an island and the multiplayer aspect of it is only really good if your friend needs one of your cherries, as there is no activities for you to do with them and when they visit, perhaps you could play hide and seek since you cannot see them, special npcs, or even your own villagers wondering on the map. It is bad when Pocket Camp, a game that is on the phone, has triple the content of this new installment. Yes, I understand Nintendo said they will update it for up to three years, but it makes a customer like myself believe that Nintendo just released an incomplete product and is trying to intrigue someone with that status for future updates when they cut so much content from the series. You are on an island, cannot dive or swim, cannot find island fruit on island tours, cannot find the DIY recipes you want unless you use third-party sites like Nookazon, and even then, you may not want to deal with someone asking 13 million bells for just 1 cherry.

The bottom line is this game is missing SO MUCH content and I feel a need to play New Leaf because this game is incomplete, lacks anything truly fun, and when Nintendo talks about three years of updates to such a stale game, they basically are telling every customer that bought it that their game, that they pay $60 to have and $20 to play online with, will not be truly complete until three years. You know, part of the fun I have had in New Leaf was time travelling to holidays when I would get bored, but you cannot do that because they are so afraid that people will spoil a holiday that tells people to collect stamps or take a few wedding photos for characters that should have already been in the game for furniture customization. This is the worst animal crossing game I EVER played and maybe after three years it would be the best, but who wants to wait three years to enjoy a game at full experience?

FYI, all these positive reviews on here seem to be made by someone who was paid to say those things because how can they be okay with a secondary player feeling left out in their experience? How could they defend this trash **** that should have not been released till evidently three years later when it would be complete? I am not saying it isn't an enjoyable game, but try New Leaf before you leave your review; I bet your opinion will change because compared to New Leaf, this is a skeleton in the series, waiting for meat and skin to be truly whole."
Dissapointed-,"May 4, 2020",0,"I am very disappointed by the glaring design flaws for multiple users on a single switch. Limiting 1 island per copy is disappointing, but limiting progressing island development forward to the first player is unacceptable. I have never seen any game developer limit critical features to the player experience to a singular player. I would not have purchased this game had I known that only one player can enjoy the full game. The only method to resolve these issues is to purchase another console which is clearly not worth while."
hcazorp,"May 4, 2020",0,"Scoring this wonderful game a zero because of the ""primary player"" limitations. My wife is currently the primary and therefore, gets a bunch of missions she doesn't want. More egregiously she is the only character who can make infrastructure changes to the island. I would be a little more forgiving BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THIS LIMITATION WHEN YOU START THE GAME. We had to find this out after I wasn't getting the ""infrastructure"" option with Tom Nook and then Googled why.

This is a stupid limitation. Secondary players should be able to contribute to island infrastructure even if a ""primary"" player has to allow this somehow. Nintendo needs to fix this idiocy. What a disappointment to learn after playing for so long."
wise21x,"May 4, 2020",6,"Anima Crossing has it's charms but there is a TON of grinding (at one point it took me a week to get the 30 iron I needed to advance the game because I didn't realize rocks could be harvested without destroying them and you need to dig holes around them to cheeze the maximum amount out of them, I mean really?)

In the end it takes a lot of work and you get items and abilities you want to decorate your tiny island but there is limited actual interaction and fun."

Especially during a pandemic when we're all broke and can't afford a new console! Nintendo if you're trying to get an extra $200+ dollars from your fans, you've failed!

Each conversation with an NPC is the same excruciating exchange. It’s like they designed the game to annoy you. Also, why would you want to buy a chore simulator such as this when the dishes need doing, the ironing needs ironing, and you haven’t called your mother in 3 weeks.

If you want to jump on the bandwagon, buy it for your little sister, let her build her island, watch her play a bit, and maybe visit with your own character. Then totally avoid it, because it really is like living inside a pre-adolescent girl’s brain. They could have made this game so much better but I think they are hemmed in by their fan base. Don’t reward the developers with your hard-earned cash. It will only encourage them further."

marith99,"May 3, 2020",0,"At first, I was ecstatic to finally be able to play this game. I was having a lot of fun playing the game, but then I found out that you could only have one island per console. I live with my sisters and we all share the switch. Once I found out, I didn't want to play anymore and regretted buying it. This is just a ridiculous restriction. Literally Ultimate Smash Bros, you can have different save files. I know that only having one island per console is normal for Animal Crossing games, but for Nintendo to basically tell its consumers to buy another console for another island is stupid. Especially since the Switch goes for about $300 each right now. Jokes on me that I bought Animal Crossing, but I won't be a consumer of Nintendo anymore unless they fix this mess ****."
passivemenis,"May 3, 2020",0,"The bottle neck that is one island representative per Nintendo switch is by far the worst game mechanic imposed on players. If you have a single household switch and your spouse/partner/child get a hold of the game, create the island first, and talk to Tom and his son first, good luck progressing with the game. The first player who starts anything in the game is now the representative and if they quit a week later then you have to restart your entire island and progress to appoint a new representative. That could be hours upon hours of progress which you have to restart because of a broken mechanic. What’s the point of a representative to begin with? Every save file should have their own island and Nintendo should allow people to progress at their own rates. Terrible game mechanic. If you own a switch with multiple people who play on it, avoid this game. It will create family feuds and will be a waste of your hard earned dollars if you’re going to share the game."

I come back to find everything I've done moved around or deleted. (I did not previously know about the single island.  OR the fact that only the main player can progress.    Please fix this issue."

Devonsays,"May 3, 2020",0,The Switch is marketed toward family gaming. Great. Then comes Animal Crossing the game which can only be enjoyed by one family member in the house because you’ve decided to depart from the convention of allowing separate game saves. Was it a hired dunce that just didn’t consider the obvious drawback this is? Or were the moneymen fat-eyed with greed so much so that somehow they thought it swell to entice families to go fully absurd and buy a whole new switch device for one freaking game? I have no issue leaping to a zero until this is fixed. What a ridiculous move that warrants just as ridiculous a response.

Razor7557,"May 3, 2020",8,"Very solid Animal Crossing experience! Gotta love all the new customization options. That said the game isn't flawless, like how it feels to have taken away some things from earlier games(Like multiple upgrades of the Nook's Cranny, now there's just one), or releasing holidays only as patches, which might be a bit annoying to people with limited internet connections.

On another note though, I really hate how certain idiotic pseudo fans harrassed the localization/development team of the game into removing any references to your character's gender in english localization. Hopefully they stop giving in to them, and instead listen to actual fans who play the game, rather than scum who think video games should be used to propagate their political agendas."

WHY is there only one Island per console?  This is an UNFORGIVABLE SIN in Console gaming.  Please correct this obvious flaw immediately!  We have multiple player profiles on the console, and would like to each have our own Island.  Currently, only one of us can effectively play this game, with the other players in our home having to effectively just watch as the on Mayor of the Island plays the game.

We should be able to create multiple save games, and have multiple Islands on a single Switch Console.  Otherwise, the game is effectively meaningless.

Lifeisbellablog,"May 2, 2020",8,"This may not be the most complex game, but something about it is undeniably charming and addictive. The little animal villagers are extremely adorable and its very wholesome building friendships with them.

There are some problems with the game that are complete dealbreakers for people though, like only having one game per console. Luckily that doesn't really affect me, or I would have had a real problem with this game. It would also be good if you could play couch co-op with full functionality for the second player. The second player can't really do much. There are also some problems that should be fixed such as being able to craft multiple things at once. I think there are also some kinks to be worked out with kicking villagers out. There are 3 villagers that I want OUT and I haven't talked to them for a month, and they still won't leave. The only ones that ask to leave are ones that I actually like. So that's just been pretty annoying for me. I also feel like there are several things that could have been added that would have made the game more rewarding in my opinion. I wish there was some factor of skill points that show your fishing experience level, or your friendship level with a villager. This may be getting a little too complicated though, but it's just my preference. Another thing is it's very rare that the villagers or Tom Nook actually asks you to complete any activities such as fetch this specific bug, or make this furniture. This feels like a completely missed opportunity to fulfill requests for the villagers. (I know this is something that is a feature in the game, but for some reason in my experience this opportunity rarely ever pops up). I do wish there were a more things to do in the vein of quests, but I think the seasonal events will keep things interesting for the foreseeable future.

It's easy for me to point out all of the faults I have with this game but it's hard to explain why I still love it despite all its faults. It has it's problems, and on paper isn't much to do, but there's just something about it. Overall, it's a very slow burn but it is satisfying to see your island develop from nothing and to your own ideal island aesthetic and friendships. The game has it's problems, but it's easy to overlook them because of how charming and addictive it is.

Before I go, I have to shoutout my favorite villagers: APPLE and MERENGUE. They're adorable and perfect and I would die for them."
EricWoodward,"May 2, 2020",0,Can't unlock terra forming because im not the island representative... Why s this a feature???? I quit the game because i WOULD HAVE TO RESTART by buying the game again for a third time to get it right. Absolute joke. There is no possible way for me to unlock terra forming without restarting.
HGee05,"May 2, 2020",9,A good way to relax despite what's going on in the world at the moment.
SW33ToXic,"May 2, 2020",5,AMAZING! Probably one of the best Animal Crossing since it was launched for the first time on the GameCube! You have a lot of liberty in this game: you can pretty much do whatever you want. (Compared to the previous titles). This game is perfect of you wanna have a good time or relax after work.
xXeqiunoxXx,"May 2, 2020",3,"highly frustrating and tedious user interface,sure its a slow casual wind down game but u dont have to go as far as monologue after EVERY action. Also the chores u gotta do to add your friend ingame.
Etc"
PinMel,"May 2, 2020",2,"My children were very interested in this game. My husband and I had never played any of the old versions of Animal Crossing. When I bought the game I was happy to see it was multiplayer m, up to 4 players. Seemed like a great family game. My 7 year old, jumped right in, made his island, gave it a silly name, made his avatar, started playing. He loves it. Then my 9 year old tried it. And we quickly learned that he could not make an island. He was devastated, as he’d really wanted the game, too. He has no interest in playing as a minor character in what’s now his brothers game. Multiplayer is useless too. It’s not even split screen. I really hope Nintendo fixes this."
TDTH,"May 2, 2020",5,"I dont mind the one island per console cause I own my own Nintendo but as a fast paced player usually playing games like Call of duty, pokemon etc etc I don't find this game interesting to me, I know its made for everyone but now I'm about 2 days in and have nothing to do its really boring, I have heard though you get interesting features within a week which isn't my thing but other people like, I'm only giving a 5 because the graphics are nice and that its a relaxing game but way too slow paced for me to like but others do, anyways I'm 50/50."
frediy,"May 1, 2020",0,I bought a switch and this game only to find I can only play it in an extremely limited way because my partner is the primary player on the island. Apparently you need to buy an additional switch in order to play the game. No problem if you’re rich I guess. I can’t believe what **** the people at Nintendo are. They evidently have no concern for their users. I have paid money for a game I will never be able to play. It’s absolutely horrifying that a game company could deliberately make this decision. It is simply unfathomable to me..
Eveydude,"May 1, 2020",0,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNLESS ONLY YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE SO-CALLED ""PRIMARY PLAYER"" IS LITERALLY THE ONLY PLAYER WHO HAS THE PRIVILEGE TO CONTRIBUTE!!!!!! I almost gave this game a 10/10 until I realized how messed up compared to the rest of the ENTIRE GODDDAMN  SERIES!!! This is because when you start by needingkm to give Tom Nook 5 bugs or fish, only the primary player, which is my sister in my case (who PLAYS THE FREAKING LEAST)
This game would get a 10/10 if there eren"
layth,"May 1, 2020",4,"Looks like a lot of fun,  looks like even though I own the game I can barley play it because of the dumb player 2 restrictions. If you do not share a switch get it."
Rockplaya,"May 1, 2020",1,"SO MUCH **** 1 person. Do not get this game if you share. Me and my wife got it, she is the island rep and barely plays so I have to account hop to progress the island. Fix your game Nintendo. Either allow multiple people to be island reps, or add separate islands for each profile."
Woolala,"May 1, 2020",10,Never log out this game since the day I get the copy of catridge. It’s been one month continuously. Great game!
CrossGuy,"May 1, 2020",0,"It is unacceptable that nintendo made it so second player literally gets almost no game. Second player will not even have 1% of the privileges first player has. The worst thing is that nintendo will not do anything about it because they did it on purpose, to sell more consoles. I once again day, **** you nintendo for ruining the experience."
Butryboms23,"May 1, 2020",1,"The game feels tedious and doesn't feel like a AAA game. A lot of the mechanics are so monotonous. If you want to craft multiple items, you have to go through the menu every. Single. Time. to craft. So if you want to craft 10 hot items, you have to go through the process 10 times with so many button presses when they easily could've let us craft a stack of items like Minecraft. I don't think the developers tested the game cuz if they did, they'd realize how tedious and boring so many of the aspects are. Also after you unlock terraforming, you can only break or build one thing at a time and the animation takes about two seconds per block. It took me half an hour to make some simple waterfalls and cliffs when it would have taken a fraction of the time if I didn't have to sit through the annoying animation for every block. They easily could've made it so we could break or build multiple things at once but like I said, it feels like the devs intentionally made the game super tedious cuz they thought it would be ""relaxing"" which it's not. It's annoying and they would realize if they played the game for more than 2 seconds. The villagers are also boring. In AC on the GameCube, the villagers had personality, felt different and wouldnt immediately treat you like a best friend. In this game, they all basically say the same stuff, they're all overly friendly and they no longer have chores for you in exchange for furniture. On top of that, they rarely interact with items or furniture which they do better in Pocket Camp. That's right, a $60 game has worse villagers than a free mobile game. Also 1 island per switch is the worst move I've seen from Nintendo in a long time and they should've fixed it. I tried to get into this game but whenever I try to catch bugs, fish, build stuff or get bells, the enjoyment is quickly ruined by how boring and monotonous everything is. This game could be way better if they fixed a few things but guarantee they wont"
Ayrtoncb,"May 1, 2020",0,"I really hope nintendo fixes the 1 island per switch, had high hopes of playing with my sister and friends online but this issue makes it unplayable"
Jonesboom1,"May 1, 2020",10,Such an incredibly charming game for when one is in quarantine. The lightheartedness is truly something special.
NanoFox,"May 1, 2020",1,"The game is great. But the fact that you can only have one island per switch is complete nonsense. Very, very poor move and the reason I’m writing this review."
frejyasdaeg,"May 1, 2020",4,"A good game with some critical flaws:
THE GOOD: Animal Crossings: New Horizons builds on everything from the previous entries in the series, the ability to visit friend's islands is fun, the gameplay almost always has something to do, and the vast array of NPC characters is exciting.
THE BAD: The online play is extremely clunky, disconnects randomly, pauses for lengthy periods when someone else joins an island (like a really long time), and is very difficult to get connected with friends. The local multiplayer is even worse, only the first player on the island can experience the full game, players who join afterward are extremely limited in what they can do.
THE UGLY: Playing together locally is even worse, with players joining the main player basically being limited to picking up items and being dragged around the island. The game is also limited to only one island per console with no ability to backup or transfer your island to another console. This means if your switch is lost, stolen or broken you have to completely start over, this is completely unacceptable in 2020, not sure how Nintendo launched a flagship title without the ability for cloud saves or console transfers.
FINAL VERDICT: The game is fun and offers a lot to do, but there are some massive drawbacks that make it hard to recommend currently, do yourself a favor and wait for Nintendo to correct some of these glaring faults."
MusSoap,"May 1, 2020",8,"Alright. Honestly speaking, this game is a good 7-8/10. The core gameplay is nothing too different from the usual game. Little improvements to the game, like actually having the option to move your home / being presented with a multitude of crafting recipes for decor is very welcome. The number of villagers possible to meet (and invite) is astounding! While not every villager makes a comeback in the game, but a number of characters last seen in the original Animal Crossing finally make a return in this game after not appearing in earlier games.

I do find fault with the one island per console thing, but... I think that has been overly addressed to the point where  My main issue with the game is the UI / Camera Layout.

Listen, I'm fine with not being able to rotate my camera outside of my house. It really isn't needed. What is needed, however, is the ability to look top-down. Way too many times have I missed a glowing spot because they're hidden behind a building or something. It's great that you've included it with the end-of-game mechanic, which isn't to be named for spoiler warnings, but I think it should become part of the core game mechanic.

The DIY crafting menu ****, and so does the inventory menu. Let's say you're trying to craft items to sell because they make a ton of bells. Sure, you can mash A to speed up the crafting process, but what if you don't want to stress out the button you already spam for fishing? Gotta fork up some money to buy a controller with turbo, or something. I'd much rather have the option to craft multiple items at once. Speaking of ""multiple items at once"", it also wouldn't hurt to change how people divide stacks in your inventory. You need to select the item, and select ""grab one"" in order to move separate something from a stack, but only at one at a time. It'd be great if we could indicate how many we would like to separate from said stack to save on time. Also worth mentioning, but I don't think the game's worth $60. I don't have a reasoning behind this, but... I think $50 might be a more appropriate price.

With all of that said, I'm not dropping the game. I love it and will keep playing it. It **** that my little sister can't play the game too, but since I am playing this single-player... I'm fine with this. Hopefully, they can repatch the game to support multiple players in the near future.

TL;DR:

Pros:
- ""Similar"" enough to older games
- Able to finally move your home.
- So many villagers to meet, some returning for the first time in a while!

Mixed:
- Crafting is cool but kinda tedious.

Cons:
- Camera angels are kinda annoying to hold.
- ONE PROFILE PER CONSOLE.
- Controversial opinion, but I don't think it's worth $60.

Verdict: Honestly a 7.5/10, but I'll give it an 8."
psjim,"May 1, 2020",10,"As a single-player experience, this game is phenomenal. I have seen this series progress since the first North American release on the Gamecube and to me, it seems like it just gets better and better. In previous games, it would feel like you are the only character who really matters. Animals would hardly interact with each other or their environments and New Horizons is a breath of fresh air in that department. It is hard to find a time when the animals won't be doing something, whether it's talking to each other, going fishing, or even reading a book. To me, this adds a much better feeling of connectedness between everything on the island. Multiplayer lends itself to getting stale pretty quickly right now, but I don't see that as a criticism that detracts significantly from the overall experience of the game. What you get from this game is a relaxing experience that stands on its own as one of the best in the series."
Htaylor7108,"May 1, 2020",4,"This game is amazing and would be perfect, but there is one huge flaw. Only one island per switch. That means only one person can truly make decisions on the island and move things forward. I just paid $60 for this game. I’m not going to buy another switch and buy the game again just to have another island for my kids(but only one because of the stupid island rule). If they changed this one thing, I would give this game a 10. I’m so disappointed in Nintendo. I bought into the peaceful game where nothing goes wrong thing"
Yes_it_is,"May 1, 2020",0,Can't play because the single user limit. I guess it would be a good game if there is only one person in your household that wants to play.
Feles_Mala,"May 1, 2020",1,"Where to start...
I'd never played an animal crossing game, and everyone I knew raved about them so I thought, hey, we're under lockdown, a nice relaxing game is perfect... I personally don't have a problem with the one island per console as I'm the sole user.

Pros:
It's quirky and cute and engaging and there are so many things to make.
The time of year events are a nice touch, but could be more interesting

Cons:
Most DIY items, shopping items etc are the equivalent of the amazon deals page; a few nice items but 95% plastic tat. I understand the aim of the game is to fill your island with consumer goods to raise it's 'rating' but it really just feels like someone raided the unity asset store for free models; very few things are aesthetically pleasing.

Interactions, menus, inventory etc feel unintuitive (to me);
i) 'drop' should not be the top item on the inventory menu.
ii) I want to be able to shake a tree for fruit even if I'm holding a spade without it trying to (ineffectively) dig up the tree.
iii) Many sub menu interactions kick you out of the whole menu/inventory after doing one thing, e.g. unequip a hat, and if you want to do anything else (unequip more etc) back into the inventory you go.

Dialogs/Messageboxes are WAY too verbose and always on; most games with chat dialog may have a verbose version the first time, and then a terse version from then on, not AC. Every time you talk to a shop keeper you get the whole 4 or 5 dialog box spiel you have to click through (even pressing b to speed things up it's still a chore), want to post a few presents to friends? *Every* one requires you to read 'hmmm, it looks like they have a postcard rack, maybe I could...' - 'who do you want to send it to?' - 'connecting to the internet' -etc, and when you're done, do you go back to the previous menu for more? No, you're kicked out to start again... 'hmmm, it looks like...'
This coupled with the above items means for example it takes *minutes* to buy one of each of the few flowers on sale from the flower merchant; click through spiel, choose item, buy, watch unnecessary animation of bells being handed over and flower being handed back, click another message, repeat. We need multi-select to buy (like fossil assessment), we need shopkeepers to have a 'I've heard this message 300 times, please just say hello and go straight to the wares' mode.
Some shops even force you to click out of a dialog just to exit the shop!

The island-visitor restrictions are odd, and strikes me (as a software developer for over 20 years) as a quick workaround rather than solve an underlying issue:
Why do we need to close dialogs when someone is visiting?
Why do we need to watch a (needlessly long, honestly, what other games take so long for people to join?) progress animation as they 'fly in'
Why can I not place items when someone is there?
Why can I not talk to a shopkeeper when a visitor is in the changing room.
All these things make the friends/visitor mechanism stilted, janky and, like everything else, a chore

Every time you catch or make something you have to watch a little 'look what I caught/made' animation, with a terrible pun, of which there is only one per item: 'I caught a sea bass, oh no it's at least a C plus' (I have stopped fishing simply because of these, and of course, you have to click again, to dismiss it.
With crafting, each item (and YOU CAN ONLY MAKE ONE AT A TIME) has an animation too (while you can speed up the crafting time, basically, you have to sit there mashing a button to make a number of the same items

All of which could be avoided if they weren't pretty much the only thing to do in the game... like, any kind of quests apart from help Gulliver find his bits and help Whisp find his bits.

Basically the only thing to do is fish, craft, catch bugs, shop and those things take 5x as much time and 5x as many button clicks as they need to (even keeping the immersive chatty nature some might like) and all interactions are repetitive, there's no variation.
None of the game-play is fluid, very little is intuitive and that 'what's the point' feeling creeps in very quickly.

If you want crafting, smooth multi-play, adventure etc... Get portal knights, AC did not get QA tested with users playing for a length of time."
guiwald,"May 1, 2020",10,"To quote my girlfriend: ""That's the best game I've ever played!"".
And she is player number 2.
Good job. And shame on 0 bombers. The concept of the game is pretty clear, has always been. Having restriction makes me speak with my girlfriend about the island, how to make it better, together."
Neiru,"May 1, 2020",0,"Looks fun but not a chance of me buying it until Nintendo allows two saves on one console. I'm not playing while my partner has to be second fiddle all the time or vice versa.

You've sold millions of Switches nintendo. This seems a cynical ploy to push more Switch lites (why would anyone bother getting one of those?). That with the lack of discounting in the eShop, 3 year old games for £50 still, you're looking worse as a company. Sony look like fluffy bunnies compared. The very least you can do for your customers (who mostly accept this pricing) is allow them to share games within a household."
bgule,"May 1, 2020",0,cant get the game because we are 2 people in our house and only one switch.
nightstroller,"Apr 30, 2020",7,"To be super honest without even considering the one-character restriction, this game is overhyped. Yes the atmosphere is relaxing and the graphics are cute, but this game for some reason doesn't really make me want to binge play it. Maybe it was designed like that on purpose, with rocks and resources spawning daily once tapped. But overall, this isn't a game I would stay up playing. Not to say it's bad or boring, just not so great in my eyes.

Olibuba,"Apr 30, 2020",0,I made an account just to say the one island per console is a terrible gimmick for more people to buy your product. At least with ACNL you could buy another game to insert into the 3DS. This is absolute BS.
BEWewer10,"Apr 30, 2020",3,"This game is tricky to rate.  8/10 if you are the first player on your island and resident rep.  But if you aren’t, then you are nothing more than a glorified NPC.  You can’t progress your island whatsoever and with only one island allowed per switch you have no possible way of actually playing the game."
Blackstar602,"Apr 30, 2020",1,The fact that only one person can truly experience the game in it's entirety is rediculous. It seems like a money grab from Nintendo to try and sell more consoles and that just isn't right.

KComer,"Apr 30, 2020",1,Such a shame that this game only allows one person to create and name an island and any other player that joins in is playing on that same island with the same resources available that have been created by the originator (a bummer when the original creator has already used the items available that day). This is a family-friendly game yet it's basically a one player game per **** we'd have to buy another console for someone else to play and create their own island. :-/ Fix this Nintendo!!
FrozenGrimm,"Apr 30, 2020",2,"I do not know anything about this game. Bought it because everyone seems to love it and I really liked it so far. Told my Mom to try because I knew she'll love it but to my surprised, we share ONE island. What make it worse is that she won't be having the same experience cuz things u can do with her character is limited.. What kind of anti consumer **** is this.. You expect us to buy another switch?

Fuzi0n,"Apr 30, 2020",1,"One island per console. Yes, one island PER CONSOLE. Not game, not account, but PER CONSOLE.

I was absolutely stunned to find out the 1 save per console setup.  I have 3 young daughters and this has caused massive issues within the household.

1 primary resident PER SWITCH makes this game a 2. If you're 1 person playing on your Switch, great this is a good game, if anyone else ever cares to try the game and create their own player, this game is A ZERO for multiplayer. Do not even bother, the results are infuriating."

All  im asking is to have at least 2 islands per switch, or to be able to have more than 1 town organizer."

On top of the general principal of me refusing to buy another system just for one game, the console is OUT OF STOCK EVERYWHERE, and we don't live together so it's not like I can play anyway--I haven't seen him in almost two months, and I have to live away from my own home for a job, but even if I did buy a new system I can't even move my game to the console that I am already attached to after all of this is over??

ekixbrass,"Apr 29, 2020",8,"This is my first time playing Animal Crossing, and it is very addicting! Very fun to play and there is always something to do. I understand why people are upset about the one island per console, but they shouldn't give this game a low rating because of it. The graphics are amazing and the animations are cute, but something I hate is that the tools always break.. it ruins the fun and I have to go build new tools which isn't relaxing at all. But overall, the game is amazing to play especially during this pandemic, it takes your mind off of things. If you're not sure whether or not to get this game, I was once in your shoes, and I bought the game because all of my friends had it. Now I absolutely love the game."
pohthye,"Apr 29, 2020",1,I have no issue when the developer decided to do this to protect their product of being abused but when I look at the price tag of USD60 per copy I seriously think that they are trying to rip us off.  I have 3 kids and I have to buy 3 copies of the game and 3 nintendo switches for them to play this game might as well I ask them to stick back to minecraft.
Fritoe,"Apr 29, 2020",9,"I'm going to start this review by saying Animal Crossing New Horizons is the best entry in the series. There is no doubt in my mind. The creativity and attention to detail that was put in by the developers is nothing short than inspiring. There is a part of me that is genuinely concerned for the future of the series, not for anything bad for the game, but for how much it has to offer. Where else can they go? The next installment is going to be something I'm afraid of. They might not even come out with one and just update this gem of creativity. I'm afraid I'm not explaining enough, but what I mean is that from each iteration we gain a new customizable feature. From being from a standard town, then to a bigger place with friends being able to visit, then to an even bigger place that has a city element, to being a mayor able to change layouts and buildings and now to a ""god"" as the community jokes about being able to shift the land itself. Hopefully, that explains my concern about the future of this game, where next? This definitely is, in my eyes, the ultimate animal crossing game and has provided millions of people including myself, hours upon hours of relaxing release. As I cross the 350-hour mark, I think its time for me to explain how I felt about the game. As the beginning is slow and may take a lot of time to start feeling like the traditional animal crossing everyone knows, you start understanding how the game is trying to teach you the fundamentals of the new mechanics introduced. It can be frustrating at first if you're the impatient type, but it is well understood the more you play. That's what makes all these negative comments so surprising to read for me. I never have written a review to anything other than amazon products and maybe a youtube comment if you consider that a review of some sorts. I even made an account to just write about this topic. Yes, the game is limited to one island per person. Do not go into this game expecting to have the experience of a maximum of 8 islands on your system. This is apparently is a reason for people to be giving the game a 0 on this site and others as well. Not about the gameplay, or what a good/bad game it is, or even how slow it takes to start as I thought the negative reviews would be about. No, it's about how f you have more than one account on your switch, the others won't be allowed to terraform the island. I cannot think of anyone who would od this other than children or people who are playing Animal crossing for the first time. I don't mean any of those remarks as insults, and I will explain. New leaf, the last game in the series before New Horizons. One player was the mayor, and that's it. Anyone else playing on your 3DS won't have access to those features. If the reasons for that aren't apparent to you, then you don't understand how basic computing and video games work and that's okay. It's okay to not understand something, that's why you should seek the information that you don't understand. Just think about how much memory it would take for the switch to have a maximum of 8 islands with all unique layouts, villagers, and all the other features that make this game the masterpiece that it is. That's not possible to fit on the system itself, therefore it's not a reality. It wasn't for the 3DS, so why is it a problem all a sudden? That's when kids come into the picture. Parents will usually buy one system for the house and each kid wants to have their own island which I completely understand as I would as well as a child. However, does that inherently make it a bad game? Of course not. I have another family member on my island who doesn't have terraforming access as they are the second player to move in. When they want to change something about the island they do one of the possible two things. They either ask me to change it for them, or they log in as me and do it themselves. Oh yeah, did I mention the ability to switch accounts on the switch is Minimalistically seamless? It takes less than 5 seconds to change profiles and start a game. It's fine to criticize a game, but it's downright insane to mass bad review a game for system limitations when the problem has nothing to do with the gameplay its self. If I'm the wrong one for feeling this way then so be it, I'll stand alone. Is Nintendo just doing this to sell more consoles? Most definitely not, however, I don't think they are complaining that this is an ""issue"". Then that gets into the problem of how the bad reviews may affect Nintendo, but it hurts the animal crossing franchise more. People will see the negative source for consumers and assume it's just another game that critics love and the public didn't, further greatening the divide between creators and fans. I really don't know what to say at this point other than how disappointing it is to see the gaming culture turn into this immaturity and not appreciate the art that countless artists spent years creating."
Chronicdoodler,"Apr 29, 2020",1,"No family should have to buy multiple switches just for individuals to enjoy their own island and experience the full game. Charge for multiple game copies, that is fine that is what AC has always done (save for memory cards on GameCube, the closest equivalent). But entire consoles? That is a shameful money grab."
TehCupcakes,"Apr 29, 2020",10,"Most of the negative reviews are from people who didn't understand what they were getting or didn't give the game enough time to see how it shapes up after some time.

Yes, it's true you can only have one island per console. This has always been how Animal Crossing games work where multiple users share a town. It allows you to talk to the same NPCs, contribute collectively to the museum, etc. so that you share the experience with your household, rather than having disparate experiences on different saves. It's how the game is supposed to be played, and I dare say it is better for it. My siblings and I shared a town in the original AC as a kid and one of the best parts was hiding items for others to find, talking about the villagers, and visiting each others' houses. None of this would be possible if each player had their own island on a single system.

It's also true that there are some things which only the first player can do... This feels arbitrary and actually is a bit of a bummer. I assume Nintendo did this for narrative reasons, and so that adults playing with their kids wouldn't have to live with their child's ""poor decisions"" or something like that... But as I said, it does feel a bit unnecessary and evokes more negative emotions than positive ones, so I don't think this was a very smart design decision. Still, the impact of these is actually pretty minimal in the grand scheme of the game, as becomes more apparent the longer you play. Some people evidently did not play long enough and just posted their immediate gut reaction.

The slow pace of the game is not for everyone, but oddly most of the reviews here don't even touch on that. You should approach Animal Crossing a bit more like the Sims than your typical game; that is, the goals are mainly to do basic life tasks, decorate, and talk to people. It's much more driven by self-narrative, and your ability to enjoy it is going to depend on your own imagination and willingness to buy into the game world.

Once you get past the initial cluelessness of wondering what you're supposed to be doing, you realize there is a lot to do and the answer is ""whatever you feel like"". Fishing, catching bugs, collecting furniture, coordinating outfits, arranging trees... It's all part of the experience, but the game does not force you to do one particular thing. New Horizons specifically adds some nice touches with the ability to place furniture outside, storage inside your house, etc. which are a sweet improvement over previous installments, and in a lot of ways make this the best Animal Crossing yet.

There are minor things I wish they did differently. For instance, I would like to mail things to friends before I visit their island, but I understand why that isn't an option. (Traditionally in AC games, you can only send letters to villagers after you have spoken with them directly. So they applied the same logic to real players.) It would be nice if the shared-screen co-op allowed you to do things like travel together or open both players' inventories. (The system in place has a leader and a follower, where the follower is restricted in what they can do... But you can switch who the leader is very quickly if need be.) All of these things are rather petty in the grand scheme of things, though.

The game is fantastic and has a wide array of content, with evidence of much more on its way. We have already gotten a pretty beefy patch and a few events, so it seems like Nintendo is committed to regular updates at least for another year+, given its popularity. You could see some of the complaints become irrelevant due to future updates, or they may just pack in a bunch more content. Either way, the updates are really the cherry on top **** that is easily one of the best of the year. Don't listen to the complainers.

By the way, it's perfectly fine to play this game solo, too. ;) Reviews shouldn't be so heavily weighted on the multiplayer experience only."
kieransteeves,"Apr 29, 2020",2,"New Horizons is so close to being an amazing game, but Nintendo's shortcomings, oversight, or negligent understanding of the modern game environment means the game falls short. The game is pretty, polished, and cute. However it feels like a relic of the past. The major shortcoming of ACNH is how the game plays when trying to play with friends. There is nothing to do with your friends. You cannot build things together. You cannot paint together, decorate together, or even use basic terminal functions when someone is on your island. You can't sell things on a friends island if you are playing too late at night. if someone tries to come to your island they will not be able to if you have a dialog box open. When a person comes everyone involved will have to wait through a lengthy loading screen. If anyone disconnects everyone's progress will be lost. These issues make no sense in today's video game landscape, no other large release has these problems. I want to love this game. It is beautiful. But the actual act of playing the game with my significant other, the reason i bought it, is near unbearable tedium."
CodyCulp,"Apr 29, 2020",0,"The game is fun and i have enjoyed my time playing the game so far. However, not being able to transfer my island to a new switch is ludicrous. Hacking will always be an issue and there is no need need to punish the fans for it. I can live with the cash grab of one island per switch but locking my island to one switch only is ridiculous."

Miinosh,"Apr 29, 2020",0,"Had fun for the first few days. When my girlfriend wanted to start playing, we realized that she could not have her own island. Since neither of us wants to be ""player 2"", which would severely limit what you can do, I lost all interest and won't play again until we can create separate islands on the same console."
ViktoorC,"Apr 29, 2020",0,"Base game is good, however you can only have one island per switch which is just a super greedy move.

Nate3nate,"Apr 29, 2020",2,"Unfortunately this game (like most Nintendo games) falls under the umbrella of extreme Nintendo fanboydom and as such is subject to insanely high biased reviews (not including the negative multiplayer ones).

Basically if you've ever played a game outside of the Nintendo lineup say like...

Minecraft, Terraria, Rimworld, **** Valley, Subnautica, Starbound, Kenshi, etc etc etc. you quickly realize that there is almost nothing to Animal Crossing and certainly nothing making it worth paying full price for.

The world is extremely tiny, it's based on real time (which is cool on paper but terrible in practice), it's got 0 challenge, and it plays like a mobile game (in fact it looks just like it's mobile version Pocket Camp).  You can run the entire starting area in about a minute, there are woefully limited resources across the entire island and woefully limited events or things to do across the entire game.

It is quite ""chill"" which can be a nice change of pace for about 10 to 20 minutes, but once you get past the bubbly exterior you quickly notice that there are no brains on the inside to keep you engaged and entertained."
Sagerronan,"Apr 29, 2020",9,"While the one island per console concept is lame, and I understand why people don't like it, I am the only user on my Switch, nobody else plays it or even wants to. I will not judge a game based on a situation I am not in. I WILL however, judge a game based on my experience.
It is a fun game, very addicting. I've never been able to get into animal crossing until now. There's something about turning an empty island into a bustling city that appeals to me. Despite the overwhelming amount of games available to me at the moment, I have played animal crossing for at least 250 hours, which is not something I can say of many games.
You start off on an empty island in a tent and then work your way up to better housing through loans from the resident loan shark (with no interest, oddly enough). Little by little you improve your island and your house and soon garner villagers to populate your village. You can pull weeds, catch bugs, fish, dig for fossils, design clothes, flags and a great many other things. It does get a bit repetitive, but is fun for me nonetheless. If you are the only person on your switch and you enjoy that kind of gameplay loop, this might be the game for you."
Gebbbe,"Apr 29, 2020",0,One island per console for a whole family. This is a big shame for Nintendo.
PotatoCake,"Apr 29, 2020",0,"The one island limit is stupid. I can't even play the game, because my brother has his own island, while I don't! The only reason for this is to get people to buy more Nintendo switches, which may I mention cost about 500 dollars right now, which is ridiculous! This is something that Bethesda or EA would do, but I never expected Nintendo to do this. Please fix this Nintendo, I really want to enjoy this amazing in the fullest, without having to pay 500 dollars."
thisiscritical,"Apr 29, 2020",0,"We bought my son the game and he started playing it on the household switch. Well, it looked like a fun game, so I wanted to give it a try. I was super bummed to find out that you can only have one island per console and that, apparently, making an island is a huge part of the gameplay that would be lost if you don't have access to it. I think it is a  ridiculous for nintendo to put on this game. I have the money to buy another console, but am refusing to do so on principal. I won't even buy a lite for this, though I would love to play. Fix this!"
Electrohead,"Apr 29, 2020",9,"The game has a fantastic first two weeks that does a great job at constantly giving you new tasks that introduce new gameplay mechanics to the player. Once you complete the 'story', you're pretty much able to customize anything you want, resulting in the ability to make some pretty incredibly designed islands and homes.

The presentation is fantastic. The game's graphics are very stylized and the NPCs are all very expressive, making the game feel like a real living world. The music is all very cute as well, especially the tracks by K.K. Slider.

You will eventually reach a point where the game becomes a lot less fun to play for extended periods of time; which is the norm for Animal Crossing. Thankfully though, Nintendo seems to be planning on supporting the game after launch and have already re-introduced past features like the Art Museum and Redd.

Other than the eventual wall you hit where the game becomes less fun, the only really big flaws are some annoying menu management and crafting quirks, which will hopefully be patched."
Chris22222,"Apr 29, 2020",2,"A fun game at first, but after some time into the game.. it became boring. Boring in terms of the frustration u get in the game. 1) fishing - these fish will let u know what frustration are - sea bass, black bass
2) i have visit lots of mystery islands, and the fruit ii get is (other than my default fruit - pear) apples.. and thats it.. nothing else. For flower, for mystery tour, i get only cosmos (default flower) and pansies.......
3) got excited in subscribing to nintendo online, hoping at least trade with those fruit i wanted, well.. Nooooo, i got no chance.. tried visiting friends.. guess what.. connection not established bcos of the stupid NAT issue.

Only good are, character design and graphics."
cryptolink,"Apr 29, 2020",0,One island per switch. Something else could've been done better. They want you to buy another console to play local multiplayer. Please nintendo. Do something about it!
Meiyi,"Apr 29, 2020",1,"Yes the game is fun until you are blocked because you are the number 2 player on your switch and the first player don't have time to play and continue the story of the game. Why could I not build bridges, buildings... ?! Just because I started to play later !

Aimee0410,"Apr 29, 2020",1,Super annoyed and kinda angry! Just purchased this game for $80 and found out multiple people cannot have their own island! Only 1 island per switch not user!  Massive downfall of the game THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!
Snico,"Apr 29, 2020",0,Bought this game with my wife. Only found out the island is shared between the switch after payment. This essentially kills both of our ability to play the game. This is a just a blatant money grab by Nintendo. Dont buy it.
nookcrook,"Apr 29, 2020",9,"This is the game we've been waiting for since New Leaf and while it undoubtedly has problems that could be easily fixed, it's still the shiniest Animal Crossing game that we needed.

The game is beautiful. The water is s t u n n i n g. The attention to detail is amazing. It's everything.

Game play is what you'd expect of an Animal Crossing game. Terraforming and crafting are intense. The control given to you literally makes you a god among animals.

It is a little concerning that there are a lot less features than what we had in base game New Leaf, but the updates will happen and give us a lot more content. If you play this game the way it's intended to be played, it won't slow down. However, since we're all in corona time and going crazy, you might get tired.

Nintendo has made some baffling choices that they're failing to fix that understandably can break this game for many. One island per console that is basically permanently tied to the console is a huge step back.

Additionally, minor quality of life changes can also help tremendously, like bulk crafting, dropping multiple items at once, giving more pattern spaces, and cutting extra dialogue we've seen a hundred times (you have to press A on CJ like 40 times each run in the fishing tourney)"
not-john-locke,"Apr 29, 2020",10,Simply the best Animal Crossing to date. All the best features from the past Animal Crossings on Nintendo's best console in decades. Been playing it since day one and I'm still finding fun things to do. Nintendo just keeps hitting it out of the park. My girlfriend loves it too. A must buy!
Stormtherat,"Apr 29, 2020",10,"I've had this game since launch and its been over a month now. Its super fun and addictive. It has alot nostalgic value if you played new leaf or older. But i think its so much better. There are some many more things you can do to customize your island. They have a few new characters that are super cute. So far they have not added some of my favorites like Brewster and Katrina. But since they added Leif and redd in the last update, I believe they plan on adding the other missing npcs as time goes on."
friendgiskard,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"Don't buy Animal Crossing unless you live alone, or no one else wants to play the game.
Nintendo crippled it, so that only one person gets to do anything fun at all. One island per Switch, meaning everyone who's not the primary player is stuck with literally nothing to do.
I can only imagine how this must go in homes with multiple children. It must result in a lot of crying and fights. Nintendo, you're a bunch of jerks."
Slywolf2020,"Apr 28, 2020",10,Dont listen to the idiots it's a reallly good game I couldnt care about one island limit because I'm not a sad pathetic weirdo who is looking at anything they can to pick at the game if you got through your original save to fast shouldnt of time skipped you fool okay play it and see for yourself I really like it
myusername123,"Apr 28, 2020",9,I’m changing my review from a 5/10 to a 9/10 simply because I was too ignorant to give the game more of a chance and now that I have I’m genuinely enjoying the it.
paulo012,"Apr 28, 2020",1,"I recently got the game as a gift and I'm actually LOVING it, incredibly fun and addictive. I only have a switch lite so I am not impacted by the 1 Switch, 1 Island problem.

Regardless, I cannot give a good review to a game which is so clearly anti-consumer. Nintendo used to be one of the last few holdouts standing against the despicable practices ruining the gaming industry, but now it seems they are jumping onto the bandwagon in a thinly veiled attempt to sell more switches (why they need to do this when its selling like crazy is beyond me). Hopefully, they will remove this ridiculous rule in an update and i can delete the second half of this review."
Levolt10,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"Nintendo needs to learn that they should allow their players the play the way you want (you know like the switches slogan) to play their games. With the recent patches and with the one island policy the person makes the second player or the third player have a worse experience. With the previous installments, it was fine but there are major FLAWS with the current system. You lose so much of the experience is the second player and are restricted in terms of progress if the first player doesn't play the game. I was actually sorry for my sister when I found out she couldn't do so much of what made the game fun. Also, the game got a patch to reduce the interest rate and reduce the spawn rate of rare bugs. They are patching the game to make you play the way THEY want you to play. But, in turn, the game is less fun in my opinion. There should be more quality of life updates rather than them taking away stuff like this because it's so fun to just do what you want and the mundane task of cutting wood is only made worse than the slow crafting system and many inconveniences in the game."

Unknown4,"Apr 28, 2020",1,I'm extremely disappointed that a family/shared system would limit the amount of islands to a console. Cheers. I've lost interest. It won't be in my household.
RichardAkimbo,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"Honestly, the game itself is hidden behind problems like micromanaging and nerfs, the idea that a game like this needs to be controlled to such an extent is really silly imo. nerfing various spawns in the game by 90% forcing absolutely terrible events that actually impede a person's ability to play. (Substituting pretty much every findable item for eggs that spawn at a ridiculous rate (Think higher than 50% frequently)

Honestly I could go on, the base game is alright, everything that they've attached to it is a cancerous growth that has ruined the host game.

plus

The fact that I would have to buy a completely new switch and game to be able to share the game the people I live with is completely unacceptable."
Marnelt,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"Animal crossing is a well designed relaxing game, I have been a fan of the series for a while and find this new entry to be the best yet. The game is extremely well polished with the graphics being quite nice and no bugs that I've seen and the gameplay is immensely fun even if the game did start off quite slow to get into things

It did release with a few features from previous games lacking, but Nintendo are showing they're adding in new content regularly and most of what I was missing is being added in. The issue people have with player 1 being in control and everyone locked behind their progression is a genuine concern but is being taken to an extreme level by people, no it's not a 1/10 game"
Pappie,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"This game is great for people who need a getaway or just need to be in their own world. There are a few gripes. 1, you can only have one island per console, 2, you have to wait a day before the airport opens, and 3, you can't access the majority of the island when you start and end up having to wait even longer. Other than that. This game has helped me through the COVID-19 pandemic. It's given me a world where I can do what I want and make friends along the way. I can create my own neighborhood and get creative with it. This game is definitely worth the $60 price tag and you should pick it up as soon as possible."
Cubehead1212,"Apr 28, 2020",3,"VERY disappointed by the fact only one person can get the full game experience. Bought this for my girlfriend only to find out later that I’m unable to do any of the activities her character is able to. I can only imagine the poor family that bought this for their two or more children only to find out that 1 of them will get a much better experience than the others. That’ll be a fun household to be in for a few days.  Whether this is a terrible design decision, a terrible profit motivated decision, or a terrible underestimation of how people like to share their experiences, it’s, well, terrible.  Incidentally, if you asked my girlfriend, I’m guessing she’d rate it a lot higher. Know why? She’s allowed to get the full experience! Turns out if you only let people play half the game, they only like it half as much."

ONYX137,"Apr 28, 2020",1,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL PLAY IT


My girlfriend bought the game for us BOTH to play. Every other game pretty much in existence allows you to have your own individual game on your separate account. However with this one you can only have one island per CONSOLE basically making the second person unable to play.  She did not pay $60 for this.  Now I feel awful because my girlfriend really wanted to play but I was the first one to start up the game.  The greed is unreal.  I guess Nintendo wants people to have to go out and buy another console. NOT HAPPENING.  In fact I'm going back to just sticking with the PS4.  I hope Nintendo reconsiders otherwise they've lost a lot of future customers. Oh and for those saying review bombing isn't okay, obviously they are the only ones in their household.

Many people, myself included, think it’s an amazing game but are forced to give it a bad review due to the 1 island limit."
Twilight-Thorn,"Apr 28, 2020",1,"All the positive ratings are people who dont have anyone else playing the game on their switch!!!! (Practically) Ok so I'm new to the animal crossing franchise so I dont mind the whole 1 island per console setup. It's the ""first player to start the game and name the island is the only one who gets to actually do something"" problem. I've played hundreds of games and I've never had this with any other. As I said before I like the idea of sharing an island, just not the fact that as I'm the second user on the console to play the game all I get to do are the side tasks and just collect fauna and customise a house. If there was no way around having more than one player doing the main game tasks like choosing where to set up tents and then other things I wont mention for spoilers sake, then they shouldn't of had the one island concept. It's just disappointing and frustrating how I cant even take part in advancing the island as a whole.

Co-op is also pointless, you get to pick up items and shake trees, that's it. Another game first for me where the second player does absolutely nothing. My only hope is that they'll bring out an update that gives every player their own island so they get to experience the WHOLE game. But this is highly doubtful. :("
fmintie,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"This is my experience as player 2 of this game. I cannot contribute to any of the game objectives, despite playing a lot.
I can't make decisions about where to put my buildings or villagers houses. The multiplayer option is even worse as if you are a ""follower"" you cant even interact with animals or buy things in shops.

The amount of arguments between younger family members that have ensued as a result of this weird player 1 power dynamic is almost not worth having the game.

I am also worried about the inability to backup a copy of my island. What if something happens to my switch? too bad for me? And if the option does become available but only with a Nintendo online account, I will have to pay to keep my island backed up, even though I have already paid for the game?

Not to mention the fact that even with owning TWO separate copies of New Horizons, neither will create a new island. This is completely different from playing Wild World as a child and I am so disappointed in the obvious greed that fuelled this decision. So to be able to make any decisions about their own island at all, player 2 has to pay up another few hundreds for a new switch. This is despicable especially as the switch is advertised as a family console."

riskybuiseness,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"This game is fantastic, I’ve had a lot of fun playing it. It creates very joyful world for you to explore and develop. Only downside is the multiplayer. I know a lot of players were mad being limited to one island per switch console, but I’m actually happy they made it this way. Now I can develop my island with the help of my siblings. However, playing at the same time ****. One player is the leader which the other players have to follow. I would greatly prefer split screen to this. Great to play solo though."
Boehnke_Josh,"Apr 28, 2020",9,Great game. The review bombing is not a fair assessment of the quality of this game
Squiggles9000,"Apr 28, 2020",8,"Fantastic game to chill to, and perfect for our current worldwide situation. People are complaining about a lack of cloud saves, and their complaints are warranted, but I don’t think it warrants such negative scores. The game is the best the series has ever been, and with a constantly changing game like this vs its predecessors makes for a more long lasting game. The ability to change the landscape at a whim, the ability to jump over to someone else’s island with ease, and the crafting system makes this the most intricate Animal Crossing released. Is it a perfect game? No, but it’s definitely better than the current user ratings let on."
DouglasFir,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"So much fun! I have played most of the animal crossing games and enjoyed them all, but this feels like the pinnacle of the series. So much to do, so many options, and the ability to play however you want! A very cute game that brings all the joy of what we expect from Animal Crossing plus a whole lot more."
HallbjornHauk,"Apr 28, 2020",3,"Bad controls, excessive dialogue, and encourages cheating! Not a good example for kids.

This game is not family friendly. No one has their own game and they all get angry at any little thing others do. I’ve had to remove the game for both our systems. That’s what $800 for two games and systems for four kids! They aren’t allowed to use them handheld or the systems would be broken by now. I’ve played with them up to today and I loved it. But all the negativity and hate this game creates is insane. I’ve never seen anything like it. Personally I would love to get myself a system and transfer my first island to it as I was the creator and get some handles for the kids. But I can’t transfer at all. I really hope Nintendo doesn’t think sale numbers mean they made a good game."
Cottontail,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"We’re in the middle of a lockdown and family’s will want to play, and yet only one person gets to experience the full game. Honestly, I wouldn’t suggest that anyone buys the game until this is changed due to the lack of care for the customers; any other console wouldn’t force the users to purchase another one just so multiple people can play individually. This generation of animal crossing has really disappointed me."
Alex212,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"Love this game, very smooth a lot of fun stuff to do and all round a great  game. The cloud save issue is enough to not make it a 10/10 but it hardly effects my opinion. If you like chill gaming then definitely get this game."
Robertinho123,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"I really thought I would hate this game when I got it. A friend of mine kept recommending it and I cracked, I didn't even boot it up for the first two days. Then I started playing and wooow, I love the experience, I've clocked 160 hours so far and while there are a few QOL changes I would recommend, I honestly love it, I'm so addicted, it's so relaxing and so much fun.

I'm a solo player though, so I don't have the issues the others have."
SKG,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"The physical edition is hard to find because everyone is buying it. Thanks a lot Xbox
10/10"
FrogJ3sus,"Apr 28, 2020",8,Honestly only a few tedious things keep this game from a higher rating. It mostly just has to with not being able to craft multiple things at once. This wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't such a big part of the game. That being said it is an amazing game and a must buy for switch.
Escutia,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"The Best Game in the Nintendo switch.
El mejor juego en Nintendo switch por mucho."
CyanRyanN64,"Apr 28, 2020",10,Oi stop **** review bombing the **** game you dumbasses haven't even played it yet
Kekekool,"Apr 28, 2020",0,I don’t really like the changes they made in the update. Such a slow game to play. If I wanted to work this hard making fake money I would at least want the game to be more interesting. It **** you can’t return a game once you buy it. I feel bad for all the people who are now stuck with this 80$ game
ArisLink,"Apr 28, 2020",10,Es el mejor Animal crossing de la historia y muy probablemente será juego del año. Es una belleza.
DulceLinux,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"Es impresionante lo divertido que es, las horas se pasan volando. Cada detalle es perfecto, para mí es el juego del año."
Edirath,"Apr 28, 2020",10,Amazing animal crossing game. much more customization than before as well as crafting and technical improvements make it the best one in my opinion.
becster95,"Apr 28, 2020",7,"I really like this game, but I think there is a lot of room for improvement I have played just about all of the AC titles at this point and this in my opinion is the second best (New Leaf first).
-There is a big lack of variety in dialogue with the villagers in the sense talking to them more than 2x per day gets them all mad and complain that the island is not big enough for the two of you.
-Not enough buildings. As of right now there are only 2 shops and all other NPC's only visit once in awhile on unpredictable schedules.
-What is the point of Isabelle announcements at the start of each day if she's not going to tell me when I have visitors like Sahara or Celeste just to name a few. I have defintely missed days with them on my island simply because I did not know they were here.
-Rugs sold from Sahara cannot be placed outdoors, why bother buying these if they can only be placed in my house when they would go PERFECTLY with the furniture I set up outside? Big opportunity missed there...
-Buying clothing from the Able Sisters shop is so time consuming, especially if I'm visiting someone else's island in the sense that I can only purchase one type of clothing at a time (ex buying the same shirt in multiple colors, I have to enter and exit the changing room several times). If there are other people waiting to use the single changing room available, it really slows everyone down.
-The crafting / DIY setup is really great, but I'd like to be able to craft multiple items at a time and have my in home work bench connect to what's in storage in home. Having all the materials in my pockets and trying to craft just takes up too much space (even with fully expanded inventory).

This seems like a long list of complaints, but the good really does outweigh the bad!"
Thefinalcrouton,"Apr 28, 2020",10,I love the game I picked it up on March 20th and haven’t been able put it down
Faxi,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons offers a relaxing time, with a lot of cute animals with different personalities and amazingly fun gameplay.

You get to choose your very own island, where you can do whatever you want with it. You can build, decorate, fish, catch insects, dig up fossils, craft and much more.

While the game offers extremely fun gameplay, a great soundtrack, and a real time system, the multiplayer part of the game is quite a disappointment.

While the multiplayer part of the game is the only disappointment of the game, since what players can do on other players islands are very limited. By playing it alone, multiplayer won't really ruin the game experience, because of the games so fun gameplay elements.

With a relaxing soundtrack, and fun gameplay and a interesting real-time system, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a remarkable game."
AidenThomas,"Apr 28, 2020",10,This game has recently gotten review bombed so ill just say this. Even if your the second account on a switch you still get to experience 90% of the game. True there are some parts at the beginning but I wouldn't say they were anything special. This game is helping a lot of people out right now with current events and is a very fun and calming experience for all ages. People review bombing are selfish and immature. If you haven't reviewed this game yet and you enjoyed the game please write a positive review to counteract the review bombing.
Generaljojo,"Apr 28, 2020",0,This game is great & me & my GF have been so excited for it. But the one island per switch & lack of couch co-op makes this game a disaster for anyone who wants to play with someone else. The dream of me & my GF playing together or at least showing each other our islands died rapidly because of this idiotic & money hungry scheme from nintendo & the developer. Fix joy-con drift first & fix the multiplayer of this obvious potential multiplayer made game. I already spent a large amount of money on the switch and its various accessories & controlers. I will not be buying a second one. Just fix the game. Let me play with my GF. It could have been so great... You failed
Mino_Reviews,"Apr 28, 2020",9,Extraordinary! Its truly a must have switch titlle! I always get excited every mroning when I wake up to discover and explore the world of New Horizons :) 10/10
Finriis,"Apr 28, 2020",1,If you didn't create the island you are absolutely barred by the first resident's progress.
Kkkkkkkka,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"I do not understand why you cannot transfer your island from old switch to a new one, it is sooooooooooo dumb that every other game has its data transfer and cloud backup, as for the most time consuming game, AMNH, there is no such option? Now I ending up with 2 switch in my hand and one only being used for ACNH and the new one sitting there soullessly... It’s a punishment for those who accidentally break their switch or just simply wants to change to Lite or a new special edition switch, very good job at earning money but the “eating” image is too greedy and ugly even for Nintendo.... (Imagine you spend 200+ hours and finally collected rare DIYs and now all gone, “welcome to the new island in the new switch, dumb ass!” Nintendo says:)"
GJ_Switch,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"I never played the other animal crossing games, but this one blew me out of the water! All those bad reviews are not right. If you just want to relax for a couple of hours you should buy this game."
EstaticWhale,"Apr 28, 2020",10,Great game with some issues like 1 island per switch but I dont really care about that since Im the only one on my switch
ChaosBadger,"Apr 28, 2020",1,A mobile idle game hidden behind a cute Animal vaneer - fun for a few hours until you get bored doing the same thing for no reward.
NinWiidle,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"First Things first: The one Island per console thing is nothing new for the series, and isn't really a problem imo. The problem is the lack of progression for the players outside of  the Citizen Representative. With that out of the way, I can get to gushing: This game is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous, and all the additions feel like a true step forward for the series. The ability to place furniture outside is HUGE, and all the creativity that results from Terraforming has basically resulted In an Animal Crossing Renaissance. The same-switch co-op is cool and a nice addition, but Isn't something you'll use much outside of the first few days.  The game does fall short in a couple areas: An (initial) lack of content, a lack of online modes(Like Tortimer Club), and a VERY slow start.

This game feels like if the series skipped New Leaf and built off of City Folk, but kept the characters from New Leaf."
Willemdog,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"I wish that you could island design like you design your room, other than that the game is actually really good and I can’t wait till the next updates!"
Zeltingle,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"I had to change my 9/10 rating to a 10/10 to try and counter balance all the dumb poeple bombing the critics... this is exactly why user critics don't matter, because of salty users."
amyylottie,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"Best Animal Crossing game in the series! Have played all since the Gamecube, New Horizons builds on the foundations of New Leaf and makes it into an experience that lets you customise your world and play the game how you want to play it. Lots more to keep you engaged than previous games, overall a great experience"
Nara69,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"This game has ruined my girls. They are constantly fighting over it, to the point of physical violence because one was more ‘superior’ in the game. My oldest can apparently do more in the game and my younger daughter can do **** all. And the fact that this cash grab restricts you to one residential area per switch is disgusting. I loved Nintendo growing up, and loved the GameCube animal crossing but to see this new game ruin my family is horrible and Nintendo must be held accountable. shame on you Nintendo. I have also just been asked for a ‘Switch online’ supscription so my daughter can play with her friends . This is a ****ING MOCKERY. I payed $60 for this game and they’re still asking me for money?! I’m actually angry at myself for buying it for my daughters because there is constant violence in my house and this game is the root cause. I can not believe what Nintendo has turned into. Next time, remind me to buy a PlayStation so I don’t see this capatilist greed."
njbvhbh,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"Anything other the first player doesn't get to play the full game and won't ever progress. Either the other players should have the same privilages as the first player, or remove the arbitary one island per consol soft-limit."
The_President,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"The one island per console is pretty stupid, but I really enjoy the game. Probably a much bigger issue for those with families or multiple users on the same Switch but for me it's not too much of a problem. Really great way to unwind, the Nook Miles are a little gimmicky but keep the game interesting for now. Kinda wish it wasn't locked to real time but mostly because I'm impatient. I can see myself logging a metric f-ton of time into this game. Good way to calm down after ripping and tearing through Hell in Doom Eternal."
Vinegra,"Apr 28, 2020",2,"Cuando era más niño me encantaba la saga, respeto que a mucha gente le guste y también que la prensa y los fans lo valoren, pero lo veo sobrevalorado más de la cuenta, ahora lo veo con otros ojos o mis gustos cambiaron, con los marios me acabó pasando lo mismo ( son más de lo mismo pero con mejores gráficos)."
Chocock,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"I personally enjoyed this game but it is most likely because I don't have to share my switch with anyone,  it must be so frustrating having to share a switch with a sibling or your significant other because player 2 will just not be able to enjoy the game like player 1. It was annoying when you had to buy another cartridge to have your own town in the past games but now you can't even do that? No, because Nintendo is money-hungry and wants to **** every last penny from your wallet for no **** reasons, now you have to buy a WHOLE NEW SWITCH which is 300$ instead of 60/40$ like before this is just disgusting. I REALLY hope Nintendo will fix this."
Ethan1526,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"This is by far the greatest game in the series. It adds many things to keep you busy everyday, and even after over a month of game-play it has yet to become boring to me. The game continues to bring fun surprises and charming dialogue. At least 95% of the negative reviews are due to the unfortunate limitation of 1 island per console. Despite this restriction this game is still outstanding and the spam of zeros are simply childish. Yes, it is unfortunate that Nintendo places many arbitrary restrictions on their games but overall the quality is outstanding. I would recommend this game to anyone, especially if you use games to relieve stress."
AKNK123,"Apr 28, 2020",8,"This is my first AC so I can't compare it to the previous ones, but I like this game a lot so far. I wasn't sure what was interesting about it before. But I know it now, I've been playing every day since I bought it, because I have to save bells and remake the whole island lol I'm sure you'd enjoy it more if you had a friend to play with. But I think you'll enjoy it for the time being, even on your own."
Echoesovpain,"Apr 28, 2020",9,Great game to play but one island per switch isn't good multiplayer feature. Maybe Nintendo can patch this later on. With that said if your a Animal Crossing fan you will still love this game.
ShaneJP,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"this is a great game, not the best I've ever played but for what it is (a simulation game) it is a good game"
Masaim,"Apr 28, 2020",10,Just here to contradict the unfair zero's. I don't own the game so pay no mind to me.
Dark_man00,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"3 personas, 3 juegos, NO COMPRÉIS ESTE JUEGO  si no vivís solos. Únicamente un jugador podrá verse involucrado en el juego, los demás tendrán menos valor que una piedra, fantástico movimiento sucio de Nintendo para fomentar el juego en local, años de desarrollo para conformar pueblos **** donde solo un jugador tomará las decisiones que tengan que ver con el desarrollo y avance del pueblo."
Squishydew,"Apr 28, 2020",6,"A great game ruined by nintendos lack of polish.

Online is incredibly cumbersome, there is no way to back up saves, you can only have 1 island per switch screwing other people in your household, and crafting was very poorly done, requiring you to craft one thing at a time with no way to improve that.

Tool durability is also just completely anti-fun."
carurosu,"Apr 28, 2020",9,This game has presented an interesting escape out from quarantine while giving a sense of accomplishment on short daily gameplays.
paperjon,"Apr 28, 2020",10,Don't believe the haters this is a great game band me and my partner are having a great time on our shared island nearly 200 hours in
alaenya,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"I think it's pretty unfair to give a game bad score just because it lacks one feature that you'd like it to have. That said, I'm someone who likes to play alone, and I don't need to share my Switch with anyone, so it's not an issue for me. I will also never understand reviews saying the game doesn't have a goal and is therefore lacking. What I see is a game full of endless possibilities where you can spend your time however you want. I love games that don't give you set goals and instead let you roam the world and most importantly, to shape the world to your liking. It's a peaceful paradise that has come at a difficult time for the world and helped heal it, at least for me it did. :)"

For when an update so we can change the representative resident Nintendo???"
Lalox,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"Desde la Nintendo gamecube no le daba una oportunidad a un animal crossing, sin embargo, ACNH me ha dejado pasmado sin darme cuenta más de 100 hrs de juego. Sin duda más que un juego un proyecto de vida online a largo plazo."
morrish,"Apr 28, 2020",9,"The game keeps getting better with the updates, and is set to be the best in the series whilst keeping to the core aim of the game - this being to promote co-operation with players and build a sense of community around the development of a small village.  If you can't play well with others, this game isn't for you."
Patrioticmisty,"Apr 28, 2020",0,"Buyer beware... Only one person is allowed to play this game per console?!? Seriously!? You can have other people make accounts and visit the island but only one person may go on with the story!

This was a combined Easter present for my 3 kids. Shame on me for not doing more research but we have never had a problem with other Nintendo titles, in this way, in the past.

Nintendo, we are big supporters of you. I’ve played your games and bought your consoles for most of my 34 years on this earth. Open up the game for my family. This game is simply not worth it as it stands."
ZAQ420,"Apr 28, 2020",0,the fact that you can only have one island per switch is truly **** ridiculous.
Marbocla,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"Es muy buen juego , muy relajante y bonito, con buena música y gráficos preciosos"
Cecchi,"Apr 28, 2020",6,You can't build two different island on the same console also with two different account and this is very bad. Just 6 for this game
Tamaguchi,"Apr 27, 2020",9,"Es mi primer animal crossing pero me parece muy bien juego, relaja, es bastante completo, podría estar mejor pero es mejorable y posible que sea actualizado en un futuro."
Handtorch,"Apr 27, 2020",0,I would have given the game an 8 except Nintendo thinks they're being slick by limiting one island per console.  I bought the game for my son and I cannot advance the game because ONLY the first person to play the game can propel the island level forward.  My son is prone to taking anything I leave outside my house; I can only imagine how that would go down with multiple kids playing on the same system.
jbeisen,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"I absolutely love this game. It is such a good distraction from what is going on in the world right now. The instant serotonin I get from New Horizons is a dependable joy every day. All of the negative reviews I've read don't seem to understand how the game fundamentally works. It is almost only a single player game, and you can link up with friends and visit each others' islands. So maybe don't buy it if you're only looking for a game your entire family can play at once on one console. But do buy it if you're missing your friends; this is a great way to still hang out while socially distancing."
Darbi,"Apr 27, 2020",4,"Yea, yea, I know. Please read fully, I promise not to be the typical bad review, though, I have the rating so low for the same reasons. I have always seen Nintendo as a family connecting platform. Some of my fondest memories are playing Mario kart, super smash, and Wii sports on the Wii. My sister got a switch for her birthday and I never really thought much of it. But when New horizons released she was eager to let me jump in. I have never played animal crossing, but this was outstandingly a great experience, I fell in love. But I struggled to help her build homes, and wasn't treated the same, nor did I interact with importance with Tom, I felt discriminated against. I soon learned why, with the one island per console, and the founder having all the decision making, really, really, really ****. I would have loved to then start my own island, or co-run the one we were in. I couldn't choose where buildings went, I couldn't progress, and I couldn't even invite villagers, one of the most important and enjoyable aspects of the entire game! I was stuck, and worst of all... This literally damaged my relationship with my sister. I'm twice her age and I felt we finally found a way to bond, but no, Nintendo turned from a ""family connecting"" idea, to a ""family tearing"" nightmare. I absolutely hate it, and I can't play it anymore, and that has led my sister to stop, and now I feel guilty, and everything is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. How could a overly family friendly game turn into a despair-enducing experience. However, it's still a 4 because if you were solo this game is absolutely perfect, but this game is built around socializing and family, and it decided it wanted to ruin both. If you want to play with anymore then a SINGLE person, which is what was frost attractive about the game, then DON'T BUY.

NINTENDO... Please, I beg you to rethink your decision. Make multiple islands where others can found, or make a co-founder system where both share absolutely the SAME privileges.

Love this game, but hate it too."
AquaToad,"Apr 27, 2020",9,I've put about 250 hours in at this point and I still don't see a day coming where I don't check my island. This is my first Animal Crossing game and so far in having a blast. Starting out with a desolate nothing island and building it up to an metropolis has been the best thing while stuck at home.
Rayman67,"Apr 27, 2020",0,"When cloud saves are added this will turn into a 10,if my switch breaks everything is gone and that is garbage"
Jonshock,"Apr 27, 2020",10,A wide improvement over all the other installments. And they even let you bring in the cards from the tragic wii u party game.
Nugz69,"Apr 27, 2020",10,Great game and great time killer. All these soyboys making fake reviews need a life. Funny how you MFs have one one review In your profiles.
RGriffin,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"Tengo que admitir que es un juego adictivo, nunca había jugado animal crossing, pero si juegos parecidos, y la verdad me encanta, el estilo visual si no es el mejor pero a la vista de verdad te encanta, la manera en que funciona estoy pegado a el todos los días, es un juegazo para los que les gusta este genero lo recomiendo"
uve,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"Awesome Game.
Fantástico para jugar un par de horas diarias. Muy recomendable"
Nile8er,"Apr 27, 2020",8,"Never got into AC before this release. Have had a lot of fun with this game. It’s a game I can enjoy with both my wife and daughter without much fuss. Easy to pick up for quick bites and also easy to sit down and kill a ton of time messing about. Some of the tools/controls can be a bit wonky, and the single island per system thing keep this from getting a higher score from me. Tl fun, enjoyable with family and friends. Couple of odd bits keep it from being amazing."
Oneills91,"Apr 27, 2020",10,Wonderful game that you really get **** into! Honestly nintendo came out with this game at the perfect time.
Meliodas998,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"Perfect, I have funny moments in all time with my family and solitarie. I recommend this game for all that want relax"
Jaygeereviewme,"Apr 27, 2020",2,The game is fun and relaxing but the one island per console set up is going to cause me a divorce. I played the game first without realizing my wife would be a completely second class citizen on my island.  Basically all the decisions get made by me and she can’t participate in the story at all. Really upsetting. It’s a great game but honestly if two people in your family want to play it it’s not worth it.
Nathan53,"Apr 27, 2020",10,Review bombing a game doing well is not cool and I hope metacritic staff do something about this.
Windexblue21,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"Don’t let a review bomb discourage you from playing this game. Nay, this work of art."
Gravityhappened,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"The game is by far the best animal crossing. It takes every animal crossing game & expands upon it. Which is everything we ask for in sequels. HOWEVER my only complaint is it’s not innovative for this day & age. The first animal crossing will always be timeless because of what it was for it’s time. Still, new horizons does not disappoint."
crevassier,"Apr 27, 2020",8,"The PERFECT game during a stupid pandemic. My only gripe is what a lot of the lame brigading reviews mention, and that is that the account that starts the island ends up gatekeeping improvements. For anyone playing completely SOLO, locally, this isn't a problem. As a household of 3, my kid was first and now we have to play as her when she isn't interested in island management. Personally I am OK with just having the one island, however, the management side of things should have been extended to all players and not just the first one.

This does not ruin the game completely and it's still a great successor to the series. Hopefully the devs can constructively move forward with an update that allows people to start easier. I wish I had known this limitation on launch day, but we stayed away from too much info so we didn't spoil the initial fun and no one wants to reset your stuff after a few days of work already got put in.

The community of designers is pretty awesome and both my wife and daughter love customizing their homes with the shared designs."
DarraghH,"Apr 27, 2020",10,Great game stop review bombing!!!..................................................................
AlexZimmz,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"This game is phenomenal. It's one of the prettiest games I've ever played, and is such a fun time. It's a game about progression and improvement over time. It's so much fun to just pick up for 20 minutes and do the daily jobs. I like to watch all my villagers interact with the environment and each other, and learn more about them as characters."
bobbykjack,"Apr 27, 2020",7,"This is one of the few honest reviews of Animal Crossing New Horizons you'll see. It's not amazing, it's not terrible. It has its moments and is certainly a different type of game than you might be used to. Very little in the way of an objective, very relaxing, very annoying in terms of repeated dialogue and some awkward controls.

It's relaxing in a kind of 'do nothing' way and it's all innocent and charming and a nice non-threatening world to dip into now and again. But it's not exactly thrill-filled or the kind of challenge you'll get from a typical game.

I couldn't care less about multiple players because I'm the only one who plays on my Switch, but if you share your console, your mileage might vary. Doesn't deserve a 10, certainly doesn't deserve a 0. Solid 7/10 game."
RoboGori,"Apr 27, 2020",9,"(First of all just because there's a feature missing, that's not a reason to give a game a flat out 0.) Animal Crossing New Horizons is fantastic. As a new player to the series I was very pleasantly surprised and have found myself playing the game everyday since launch especially due to the quarantine. With the base game content alone I probably would give the game an 8, but due to the fact that they'll be continuing to add content for the next 3 years at least, I have to give the game a 9, and very close to a 10."

Landenwin,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"This game is incredible! It’s has so many improvements from previous Animal Crossing game and is an overall fun and charming experience! It’s a lot of fun visiting friends islands and playing online with others! The game provides a hole new level of customization, with the ability to create new higher land, waterfalls, rivers and more! You can also customize many pieces of furniture and place furniture outside. All this allows you to really make the island how you want. Definitely a must have for anyone on the Switch!"

Araine,"Apr 27, 2020",10,"Basically it is a really good game. The fact that it’s shared on console is a tiny factor of negativity in a great game. It builds on previous editions of the game, not tearing it down. People need to find a hobby other than wantonly down voting something for no reason. The people with legit concerns, like the shared console issues, are perfectly understandable. Especially if you have children in your home that do whatever they want. Or the people who want their own island. Regardless, the game is still good. If you liked the other games, I cannot see a reason for why you would t like this one, other than the said console issues.

Timur132,"Apr 27, 2020",9,"Despite everyone here talking about how ""The first player is the main one"" principle is bad and ruins fun, I actually kinda see, what Nintendo intended with it(through I don't think it fully works), every other player has to ask first one, if they want new bridge, move some house and e.t.c and raise money together for it. I'm playing with my brother with me as the first player and he doesn't find that too problematic"
VloneBrazy,"Apr 27, 2020",9,Really chill game that lets you do whatever feels like it could relieve your stress. With a wonderful atmosphere and adorable aesthetics you can enjoy your own life on a deserted island. This was the first animal crossing game I bought and I honestly did not see the appeal before. After playing I can finally say that seeing your island life progress with new animal friends and your own creativity shine to show for others or simply for yourself is a fun thing. I have not even started to play with friends yet but I can imagine that will make the game even more enjoyable.
TrevorHickman,"Apr 27, 2020",0,One island per console is so ridiculous. I bought the game for my TWO children to play. So unhappy with how it plays where one basically can change the island and the other is stranded and forced to watch on. Would never have bought it if I'd read these reviews first. Buyer beware.
lvaccaro,"Apr 26, 2020",0,"Extremely frustrating design choices ruin the game if you want to play multi-player or share the game among family members.

I got the game to play with my GF during quarantine but the multiplayer is not fun. The reason is that the player that created the island (in this case her) gets to be the primary character and any others are “guests” who are just tagging along.

What makes things worse is that I cannot even create a separate Save File and enjoy it as single player as the game limits you to one save file per console."
lyds,"Apr 26, 2020",7,I want to start off saying this game is great and I'm enjoying it but I will say it's a bit more stressful than the DS version because there's a lot of running around and collecting but I'd say that's just apart of the game. The only thing I want changed as soon as possible is the only one island feature. I have a younger brother and he is on my island because he wants to play but cant make decisions or do really anything because its my island and I want to create it so he's only allowed to gather things which saddens both of us and on top of that he has the possibility of ruining things and he takes many resources I need. PLEASE ADD ANOTHER ISLAND FEATURE. Also the follower and leader same device multiplayer thing Is super annoying. At least make it so there's multiple islands... otherwise it's fun.

Azzytap,"Apr 26, 2020",2,"Why would you create a game about community and friendship that you cannot play with friends and family by locking to be island per console?

Also, there are other issues with this game. The graphics are barely better than the mobile game, the characters are so friendly they don’t feel real and lack variety in their personalities, and you can advance so quickly you’ll burn through most of this game and get bored fast. This game really could have used being ‘bigger’ IE more areas to explore and more items to collect."

FrustratedUser,"Apr 26, 2020",1,"RE: One Single Island Per Console, Shared by all users.

It is incredibly frustrating that the game is only One-Island-Per-Console. My wife and I have different users and NSO sign-ins, and it **** that we can't each have our own island short of buying two Nintendo Switches (difficult with COVID) and two copies of the game.

Why on earth would Nintendo go out of their way to make this unlike almost every other game and application ever written that respects multiple users. It is bad enough each user can only have one Island/World/Profile, but to force other users to share them is really really dumb. Like to the point my wife doesn't even want to play a game I'm pretty sure she'd love.

Anybody who has ever had to share a console knows that this ****. Anyone with siblings over 30 knows how bad it **** when someone screws with your save-data-slot. There isn't only 128K free for save data. The files cannot be that big. There is no good reason for this.

While the game is wonderful otherwise, this is a glaring, absolute foundational defect that completely ruins the gameplay and usability. If there is some technical reason why this ""must"" be the case, the island is going to get extremely small if 7 additional users put buildings on it."
RadioReviews,"Apr 25, 2020",10,"I grew up with animal crossing, from Wild World to New Leaf I couldn’t miss out on New Horizons. I played the game the day it released and it’s become part of my daily schedule ever since then. The game offers a peaceful getaway from the stress of the real world and allows you to turn a deserted island into your own personal paradise. Like Minecraft once said “the only limit is your creativity” and that fits perfectly for this game. Almost unlimited design options from planting flowers to terraforming mountains and waterfalls allows players to practically play god and do whatever their heart desires. The start of the game is a bit slow and tedious as players try to get all the buildings and upgrades so you can do as you will. The core part of the game is building a community with these adorable animals that will populate your town that have their own personalities and preferences. Featuring many popular returning faces including Tom nook, Timmy and Tommy, Isabelle, able sisters, Leif and many more you are bound to reunite with your childhood favorites. Collecting different rare fish, bugs, and fossils is a main component of the game and can be, annoying, at times but makes you feel accomplished apon collection. Multiplayer is something I use frequently in the game and I’ve discovered it to be, boring. No mini games, annoying communication, and limited interaction forces players to come up with their own things to do (or just awkwardly stand next to each other and doing emotes). Multiplayer is good for trading but that’s honestly about it from what I’ve personally experienced. In a game where you can do almost anything there is something for everyone here and can bring some peace to even the rowdiest of souls. With no violence, swears, drugs, or sexual references this is almost a “shell shock” being seen as one of the best selling games of the year so far. This game allows me to stress out about where to put my flowers instead of stressing out about deadlines and drama and is a nice feeling that only this game can deliver. I can see this being part of my daily schedule for months to come and I always look forward to what new exciting thing will happen on my island each day."

Billmick,"Apr 25, 2020",4,"It pains me to score this game so low, I've actually really enjoyed the first two weeks of gameplay and have been waiting for its release since it was announced.
It retains all the likeable features of the older games in the series and adds a variety of new mechanics and experiences that makes it feel so refreshing to play; easily a 10/10 in that regard.
HOWEVER!
Myself and, as evident from the User Score Distribution above, 50% of the player base were the unlucky ones. How? Let me braked down why this game failed so many people:

1. Shared Console, Shared Island
Now I personally don't mind sharing my Animal Crossing world with my brother. Creating an aesthetic together and foraging really harks back to our childhood. The option to play simultaneously on the one screen is also a great, much needed addition to the series, but why isn't it optional??
Nintendo decided that each Switch console will be limited to ONE ISLAND per system. That means if you and whoever you may share your console with want to play this game, you will be forced to live together on the island indefinitely. All island data is stored locally on the console, so no amount of $$$ spent on separate game cartridges will ever solve this, so if you want a different island, you'll need another console AND another copy of the game.
The Switch is the most powerful and innovative Nintendo system to date, with a default storage of 32GB. Animal Crossing New Horizons is 6.4GB before any save data is stored, and after a combined playtime of 60hrs between myself and my brother, the game now takes up 6.5GB of our total storage! An additional 100MB for two accounts and a whole island?! That's it?! Surely each account could have the option to share an island or have one to themselves?! This is so disheartening as this is such a primitive move by Nintendo... but it's not even the worst.

First in, First Served
Now the whole appeal of this new game was the fact that you were no longer limited to only decorating the interior of your home. Placing buildings wherever you want, inviting residents to your town, starting construction on bridges and ramps, the ability to carve rivers into the landscape ... if you were the first user to play the game on your shared console.
Any person who decides to join your island after you will be almost indefinitely restricted to shaking trees, fishing, and popping balloons. Yes of course there are a few more features to play with and enjoy, but how long will these last before they become tedious for player 2?
Unfortunately i was the second user to join a New Horizons island and as I approach my 50th hour of gameplay, I'm beginning to feel ripped off. For any progression to happen to our island requires my brother (player 1) to play the game as much as i do so that he gets the prompt to upgrade the shop, or place a new building, or build a new bridge. And what happens when my bother loses interest in the game? Will I have to consistently log him in and out to progress? Will I have to restart our island? There is a sense of pride and individuality that you hold for your unique villager. Swapping to my brother's villager to receive building privileges would allow me to build the things i want, but deep down I feel I'm being stripped of achievement and that my villager is basically useless.

With these setbacks I believe the game only deserves a 2/10, but I'm holding onto a hope that in a future update Nintendo will fix these issues for their otherwise perfect game."
Nekita,"Apr 25, 2020",1,"Compre el juego para jugar con mi novio, resulta que solo el usuario principal disfruta de todo y hace crecer la isla. Me parece una estafa gigante. Estoy muy disconforme con la compra."
Jscardona5,"Apr 24, 2020",10,Muy adictivo la comunidad es genial horas y horas de juego uno de los juegos más completos que aya jugado .
Antisanta,"Apr 24, 2020",2,"The local co-op is an absolute joke. Also, if you're not the first player to create a character on the island, you're pretty much shafted. You will have NO way of progressing through the story or make changes to the island. There's not even a way to make multiple islands on the same switch. Basically, if you aren't player one, this game is completely unplayable"
Starf0rge,"Apr 24, 2020",0,"The WHOLE POINT of getting this game was to enjoy playing TOGETHER. Nintendo is just being greedy when they require you to buy TWO switches, and TWO copies of the game to play co-op with your spouse. I wanted to share and island with my wife, as this game was supposed to be our minecraft substitute. That's not gonna happen now, but Nintendo already has my money now. No luck getting it back either, not with their ""no refunds ever"" policy."
legacy2xer,"Apr 24, 2020",10,"A very decent game, i don't know what the complaint of having one island per switch is all about?

No such thing as free lunch in this world and definitely there is no such thing as buying one ticket for the whole family whenever you enter places like Disneyland. You can share the game just fine, you don't need two islands. You can share a car but remember when you pay for the car you only get one when you have only got money for the price of one."
grayfox99,"Apr 24, 2020",0,"Seriously it's 2020 this one save slot nonsense needs to go. This isn't one island per profile, not one island per cartridge, but it's one island per SWITCH CONSOLE!!!! This is just greedy horse crap there is ZERO reason to have one island per console. The game-play is good, but this island limit kills the entire experience for me, and just makes me furious not to mention that only the first player to create the island is allowed to progress it so the second player can't even do anything meaningful."

BooOfShadows,"Apr 24, 2020",9,Este juego brinda grandes horas de entretenimiento. Siempre hay algo por hacer y es increíble explorar la isla. La decoración de la isla y la posibilidad de decidir donde colocar cada uno de los edificios además de poder hacer caminos o hacer los ríos más grandes o cortos entre otras funciones dotan al juego de un increíble carisma.  El único fallo que le veo es que únicamengete se puede tener una isla por consola obligando a los jugadores a comprar más de una consola si quoeren tener dos islas diferentes a la vez.
Tartarus,"Apr 23, 2020",0,"This score is for playing the game when you're a second class citizen. If you happen to be the first person in your family who boots up the game, great. You'll have a better experience.

Everyone else who wants to play on the console, you're out of luck. You will not be able to play the game to its full extent. The one island per console limitation is probably one of the worst decisions ever made in gaming. On top of that, only the ""main"" player can advance the island. Not knowing this, I spent a lot of time thinking there was a major bug in the game. When I found out it was a feature, I was surprised and not in a good way.

It's not likely it's because of a Switch technical limitation, as the Switch is able to maintain separate save files for every profile for just about every other game, including games more complex than Animal Crossing.

This is just a poor design decision or a bad tactic to try to sell more consoles. Seems Nintendo dreams of every person in a family having their own Switch. Well guess what, not going to happen. Just going to get tons of negative reviews instead."
B3anz,"Apr 23, 2020",0,Everyone in my family chipped in to buy this game but now in turns out that only one of us can really play it.
Discoduckasaur,"Apr 23, 2020",4,"To start, this game is incredibly fun at its base. But there are some truly asinine decisions made by Nintendo here that simply should not be accepted in a modern game. They don’t deserve to be praised like they are being for hurting customers with bad and artificial restrictions. The good: this game is, as far as straight gameplay goes, truly wonderful. It’s everything Animal Crossing was meant to be and it retains the heart of the series. While it’s missing quite a few of the features previous games had, updates look to be coming regularly to bring it up to par (looking at you Redd and Lief from the recent update). It’s charming, has lasting appeal, and has enough to do that even past the first few weeks you’ll want to pick it up every day. The eh: people with odd hours may want to set their time zone to a more traditional time before playing. I tend to be up at odd hours due to my job and on a lot of days that means I’m not allowed to sell items at full price, sell turnips, buy clothes, talk to most of my neighbors, or catch certain fish/bugs. Time travel still works in this game but turnips will spoil if you do. The nature of the game dictates that you have things tied to time but give nighttime players more to do! If I happen to be only able to play at 1 am one night I should be relegated to only resident services and the museum, with the occasional visit from Whisp.

The bad: if you want to play this game with anybody other than yourself, you’re looking at the most tedious and unnecessary multiplayer system known to man. A long animation is required for each player visiting your item. It requires you to exit all menus and failure to do so means the visitor can’t come. If more than one person try to visit at the same time, at least one will get an error and have to keep trying. It makes visiting with friends incredibly difficult. If you want to have anybody else in your household play the game look forward to buying more Switches because the only option is to share your island. That doesn’t sound so bad EXCEPT only one person gets the full experience. My mom wanted to play so she got her own tent on my island. Since I’ve been playing for weeks though, she gets zero build up, far fewer nook miles, ZERO instruction past a handful of things, and she needs me for a lot of major island additions like houses. Why can’t it be an option to create a separate save file for each person? I’m guessing that good old fashioned Nintendo greed has to do with it. It’s not enough to pay up to $300 for a console and another $60 for a game I’d bet will never see a sale, if you want to have the full experience for everybody in your house on a so called family console, you’ll need to shell out at minimum $260 for a switch lite and another copy of AC to give just one more person. Also, speaking of my mother, I went to visit her for a week and went to change my time zone to hers so we could get the standard experience. That means that all 800,000 bells worth of turnips that I had spoiled. I live in Eastern time and she lives in Central. ANY time travel backward means your turnips spoil. Look I get it, time travelers don’t get to game the turnip market. But I’m not manually setting my time here, just updating a time zone to reflect where I’m at physically. But that makes me a dirty cheater apparently and I’m being punished as such. What else could possibly be wrong here you ask? How about zero cloud save support despite the promise it’d be added ‘shortly’ after launch. How about no bulk crafting for items you’ll definitely need in bulk. How about the first major event completely ruining some of the best part of the game by turning everything into eggs? This game could’ve been perfect. And I know some of those gripes may not mean much to some, but it’s a serious disappointment to me coming back to the series for the first time in a long time to see it turned into a frustrating version of perfection.  I have zero hope nintendo will do the right thing and fix most of these issues. This is why I tend to stay away from Nintendo. Every time I give them another shot they take my money and give me half a product. Shame on them, but shame on me too for trusting them. And for playing this game still. Despite everything it’s still too fun to put down, even if I am incredibly frustrated. That’s why it gets a 4 and not a 0, but there should be a warning on every box about all the ways Nintendo will force you to have fun on their terms and not your own."
SteveWonder8890,"Apr 23, 2020",0,"If you have more than 1 person in your house, don't bother buying this game. You can only have 1 island per switch. Very, very hard to enjoy the game at the beginning. Not being able to skip cut-scenes and skip dialogue kills me. If you do have to share an island, the person who didn't make the island doesn't have control over anything. You pretty much just gather resources. Very disappointed that such a promising game was ruined by Nintendo being petty and greedy. Will never play again."
surajdave,"Apr 23, 2020",3,"This game would be a 10 but there is one huge flaw. Nintendo refuses to let you have a different island per user. And will require you to purchase another console. This, paired with the lack of cloud saves is a very scummy choice by Nintendo. Other than that good game but the anticonsumerist approach to this release, especially when consoles are incredibly difficult to get ahold of, leaves a bitter taste in my mouth and I cant recommend for those reasons alone"

SpookyFoxx,"Apr 23, 2020",0,Pretty short sighted and money hungry to force households to have 1 island per console. Every other game on the Switch allows multiple saves except this one. Just shows Nintendo is no better than the rest of the shady AAA gaming industry.

This is how much I need to spend in Brazil to purchase a switch and a copy of animal crossing.
If I want to have me, my son and my wife to play the game as I usually do to any game I buy, I have to spend 2.040 dollars, what game in the world is worth that much for family fun?
Easy answer, easy review, there are way better games out there that will make you enjoy your time playing while you comfortably wait for the release of Hokko Life, that is going to be launched this year and is a similar game to Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and for PC, without the console bound restriction (means you can buy many copies of the game without needing extra PCs to play)."
CaptainOfTgeSky,"Apr 23, 2020",3,I (mostly) thoroughly enjoy this game but am getting increasingly frustrated with some of the mechanics. The biggest ones are of course the 1 island rule which is honestly INSANE to me. But I also find the design downloader quite annoying. Why can't I edit designs I download? Even if I copy then? Makes no sense. The crafting gets really monotonous because you have to do it one at a time and I would love to see you be able to craft using your storage inventory
Batmanishguy,"Apr 23, 2020",5,"I really like this game, and personally for myself alone it's a 10/10. But the fact that my roomate can't play the game at all mean's it's a very valid 0. I've read people saying that a 0 is non nonsensical, However, this is a game play rating, and this setup allows for literally 0 game for him to play. How is that not a 0? Roaming around my island with nothing to do is not a game, it's an interactive museum at best (coincidentally, this game has an amazing museum set up!).

I digress, assuming you're actually able to play it, it's a very good game. Super fun to build up an island, collecting artifacts is surprisingly fun! I'm in the end game and having the ability to terraform is amazing! I love creating things, and hunting for bugs and fish! I also love visiting friends (outside my own household) islands and **** fruits I don't have.

Any who, if there is a 11 ratio between people who are going to be playing, game cartridges owned, and game consoles owned. I HIGHLY suggest it, especially if you have friends who play it. If that ratio is off, there's no way I can suggest it. It's too good to not be able to share fully."
benacious,"Apr 23, 2020",0,"Being limited to a single island ruins this game.  I shouldn't ever even have to wonder **** can be played with different accounts.  It's common sense.  I just bought a switch, which was a horrible experience with the current stock shortage, specifically so my wife and I can each play this game, have our own islands, and share our individual experiences.  My jaw is still laying on the floor after learning that you are stuck with a single island that all users must share.  I'm not even given the (bad) option of buying a second copy of the game to open up the option for a 2nd island.  This is an awful, awful design decision.  If the motivation is to stop cheating, first of all, why would the devs care if somebody is cheating at a single player life simulator?  Ruining the experience for multiple players within the household only creates a bigger problem.  Until this game is patched with a reasonable option for individual players on the same console to have their own individual experiences, this game is worthless to me and many others.  The entire premise of this game is having YOUR own island and making it YOURS.  This is a horrible, horrible move that needs fixed immediately."
SuperDuck23,"Apr 23, 2020",9,"A wonderfully relaxing, peaceful and unique video game experience that won't be to everyone's taste, but for its target audience it will be like a dream come true."
kwartip,"Apr 23, 2020",10,Wow best game of the year!  So much replay value it's insane!  And now with this new Nature event there is even more stuff to do!  Even the island vendor had some special things I've really be needing for my gardens.  I'm just so in love with this game.  :)  REPLAY VALUE!!
Evanblink,"Apr 23, 2020",1,"I bought this game to play with my wife but the one island limitation is ridicules! Her experience was very limited because I got to play it first! The second player has nothing
to do on the island. We wanted to have separated islands to compare decorations and stuff but, guess what? Only if one of us buy a new console and game ! No ****** way! The game itself is awesome, but this is a deal breaker for me."
duckloft,"Apr 23, 2020",0,"This would be a great game if Nintendo would just fix the ridiculous multiplayer mode and the only-one-island problem.  My kids just want to sit and play it together with a split screen where they can all make decisions.  Let them each have their own island or stop advertising this as a multiplayer game.  As is, it's nothing more than a source of constant frustration for everyone except the first player.  Nintendo, fix your game!"
chakibrzg,"Apr 23, 2020",0,This game is good but it's just overhyped by the critics and i got tricked to buy and play this game to find nothing special with it

zweistein_mo,"Apr 23, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the newest Game in the Animal Crossing Franchise and for me, It is the best. The cute look is very beautiful and I love it when i wake up and go to my switch to see what's happening. I took 1 point away because the dialoges in the game are very long."
Lumic,"Apr 22, 2020",0,"Only one island per console?!! Why? If there are several people in the family, then you have to play on the same island. Nintendo I'm disappointed."
daveccrit,"Apr 22, 2020",0,"So, I bought this game specifically because it stated it was 1 - 2 players on the box. To my disappointment, it is NOT 2 players. It is 1 Player with a helper. I really like the game, but that was a clear case of false advertising, and the company should be sued. The first player to start the game chooses the island that everyone local will be ""playing"" on. The first player is the ONLY player who gets to choose where the new residents go. They are the only player that can trigger main events to progress the story. Only one player can visit other islands at a time, you can't go together. All of the main events can only be triggered by the first player. The first player is the only one who can choose where bridges and ramps get placed. On top of this, other accounts on the switch can NOT create their own island, they are stuck being helpers on this one island, so forget buying this game for the family, it was a waste of money. Multiplayer games are not new, split screen is not new, so do the decision makers for this game have their heads in the sand? Next time hire people who know what they're doing when making multiplayer games."
Hollowman064,"Apr 22, 2020",0,"I have never played an Animal Crossing game before and decided to play this one for the first time. BIG MISTAKE! The fact that we get such a tiny island that we are forced to share it with other profiles is ridiculous. I can't enjoy the experience when someone else is taking all the resources and they can't enjoy the experience because I can't play often enough to advance the game. Even if we did delete the save file and start in their profile, it doesn't help because I still wouldn't be able to do anything without resources. This is the stupidest concept to force upon people and a giant waste of money. I feel ripped off and I want my money back!"
Cicreti,"Apr 22, 2020",8,"Nice game, gets what it tells you.
Besides the wall texts to do almost anything, it's a relaxing experience overall, getting the village done, making your house, completing the museum. The one villager representative is a downside along with the free for all time travelling, but it's how each one plays the game.
Like in mmorpgs, put your life aside and then get to make your island with your face!"
Fallingroy,"Apr 22, 2020",9,"People are being way to bad on this game. Yeah, being limited per console ****, but otherwise it is probably the best animal crossing game in the series."
Averykl,"Apr 22, 2020",3,"Originally this game scored close to a 10/10 for me. Due to the poor design choices for multiplayer, I am  3 weeks into this game and unable to expand my island or complete any of the main goals of the game.  The first player to play the game is the only player who has any control and the only player who can ultimately play the game to its fullest. I was the second person to start the game in my house, and I am the only one currently playing it. However, there is no ability to delete users or switch who the main resident is. This game lacks the proper communication to users before playing - had I known this was the way the game worked, my boyfriend would not have started playing first. Now, I must either completely start over and lose all of my progress and hard work I have put into this game, or I must log on to his account and play both of our accounts to ensure I can actually complete goals and expand. I am actually quite surprised with how overlooked this design was by Nintendo - extremely disappointing."
Canine,"Apr 22, 2020",0,"This game har AMAZING potential but the experience is absolutely 100% ruined for a couple who shares one switch, solely because of the 1 island per console combined with the RIDICULOUS second resident restrictions. I would accept the fact that we have to share one island together but not the fact that 2nd player doesnt get to play the game. Either we  should be able to have seperate islands for each user or let all residents have full access to the shared island!"
Sophiexxx73,"Apr 22, 2020",5,"This review would basically be the same as the other negative review on here, so just read the majority of them. To put my on review though I would say this game is good, I've so far enjoyed my experience and that's as a solo player even then I'm disappointed in the solo save feature, I've seen that apparently having 8 people on one island is ""multiple saves"" but that isn't true, that's one save for multiple people. I can see that critic reviews are positive and I can only imagine that they won't actually play this game like most intend or like family with one console for the family. Silly idea for a brilliant game, and all for the money. Very sad."
Kbenz,"Apr 22, 2020",5,"PLEASE please please add more custom design slots. This limitation is MAJORLY affecting my enjoyment of the game, and will be the reason I stop playing. I can't continue to customize my island without a LOT more design slots. They fill up so fast and if i delete one to add another, the design changes in the game. I have stalled out on game play and the only enjoyable part left is customization and now I can't continue that either."
JPAero,"Apr 22, 2020",10,Great next step in the franchise that builds more into the game than the basic functions of the predecessors. Enjoyable and addicting.
Beardo7,"Apr 22, 2020",2,"Update - scored this a 6 after a few weeks but now a few months in and it’s gotten very dull. If you enjoy a game with no direction or goal at all where you just repeat the same boring menial tasks over and over (with horrendous UI) for no reason get this - if you want a similar game but with interesting stories and things to aim for get the far far superior **** Vally. (Which is also £40 cheaper! And 100 times more fun) I’ll break down AC simply Boot up

See nothing is happening Collect the same Fruit/fossils you have collected for the past 40 days Sell them Check turnip prices

Hear the same dialogue from your villagers you’ve heard (well read) for the 50th time.

All this takes about 5-10 mins

Turn off for another day and wonder why you spent £50 on a mobile game for a £300 console.

And repeat.   . 1st of all no way this game is a 10 but neither is it a 0!

The game is relaxing and a good way to chill and out get your creative mind going to see what ideas you can come up with for your island and it can be good fun! And building your museum collection up with insects and fish is nicely done and good to see your efforts displayed. The fossils part is done well and actually displays them in a chronological and evolutional order which is fun to discover and I’m sure kids will love it.    However this lasts about a week and then after that it starts to wear a bit thin.

I have no problem with the real time aspect of the game per-say (I also dolt mind the accelerated clock in **** Vally both have their merits) however I do feel like it was done to extend the life of the game. And the repetitive nature of the game does become a bit boring you will find yourself just doing the same menial tasks over and over for little or no reward. At times it does feel like a mobile game you have paid £50 for to play on a £300 console. Also it’s 2020 Nintendo why is it not a fully 3D game? Not being able to rotate the camera 360 degrees? I mean come on.

Not being able to craft more than 1 thing at a time is also annoying I have 8 clams and I want to make 8 fish bait, I can’t just select make 8 and it does it, no you have to go through the same process and animation 8 times! The islands you visit via nook miles will soon become repetitive as seems to be limited to about 10(?) different layouts I have visited the same island 3 times in 2 days. 6000 miles well spent.

The dialog with your island buddies soon becomes irritating as they just repeat the same lines over and over and don’t really offer anything. Multiplayer is a mess why can’t I open my gate and my friends just pop over? No I have to sit through the same loading screen and animation for every person that visits and same when they leave plus when they are arrive there is nothing to do? No mini games or anything to do together which is a shame. I have also knocked a point off for the 1 island per console stroke that Nintendo have pulled just to try and sell more units - luckily me and my wife are happy to share a character so in our house it’s not an issue but I can see how it could cause problems. The tools breaking without any warning is also frustrating! Why no status bar? We had this in Minecraft a game that was made in what 2007? And gold tools shouldn’t break! I’ve worked hard for them and the they just break? It should be a reward for all your hard work. I don’t want to seem like I’m just moaning about the game as I have had fun playing it and i think of your prepared to look past the annoyances there is a good game in there! And it’s a break from the normal FPS/Action/FIFA style games. I just wish a bit more thought was put into the UI and Quality Of Life of the player. I also have a sneaking suspicion that Micro Transactions are on the way as it’s a game primed for it but I hope I’m wrong!

Would have got a 7/10 from me if it wasn’t for the 1 island per switch idea. I think 6/10 is a fair score."

This game looks amazing, it's smooth unlike any other Animal Crossing game, its new features are some that fans have been waiting for years. From what I've seen and heard, it's addicting as every Animal Crossing game and, with every information I gathered about this game... I gotta say, you NEED to buy it."
Skip2MyLu1986,"Apr 22, 2020",1,"I really liked the overall game but I just can't get past the game only having one island per console. I'd be totally fine with sharing the island with my kid if both of us could complete main story quests but only the first player to establish the island gets to progress the story. So even though I created my own character on the same island,  all I can do is collect things and wait for the first player to eventually progress the island. It makes it where I don't even want to play anymore because what is the point? Just a terribly stupid choice from Nintendo that will probable turn me off these games for good."
avanzo85,"Apr 22, 2020",10,"Entendo que a limitação de uma ilha por console é bastante infeliz e afete a maneira como famílias com diversos usuários interagem com o game, mas isso nem de longe é motivo razoável para a chuva de zeros aqui nos reviews. Do meu ponto de vista, como usuário único, isso não é um problema e o que resta é um jogo extremamente viciante, gostoso de jogar, com atividades infinitas, muito bonito graficamente e relaxante. O único ponto negativo são os preços absurdos praticados pelo Tom Nook. LOL"
Killerkirin,"Apr 22, 2020",3,"This is a review that comes from a secondary user of the game.

While the game in itself is fantastic, peaceful and brilliant. I have never been more disappointed by a game. This probably comes as my partner and I were excited for this game to come out for a long time. The unfortunate truth is that you  cannot create multiple island for multiple users. This is absolutely disappointing as it shows how much Nintendo wants people to buy more of its products. I have never given a review before and I am extremely sadden by the fact the developers completely ruined the game for me as I cannot have my own story, my own adventure. It only leaves a bitter feeling in your mouse..."
asiantuntija,"Apr 22, 2020",0,I spent 60 e on the game and also had to buy a memory card to be able to download it. Now it turned out that only one profile can own an island and others are just guests. So now I have one happy kid and one sad. I’m very disappointed at Nintendo. They better fix it. It’s 2020 – there surely aren’t any technical restrictions preventing each profile from having an own island.
spiritcode55,"Apr 22, 2020",9,"By far the best in the Animal Crossing/Forest series. It does lack stuff to do at about two weeks in, after a certain event, that somewhat signifies the end of the ""tutorial"" if you could really call it that. But after that you'll soon learn that in Animal Crossing, there is always something to do! The ""Nook Miles"" are a great addition, giving you something to do even when you are done with your daily ""chores"", which only consist of the usual Animal Crossing activities such as fishing and catching bugs, doing favors etc. It should also be noted that the game improves upon New Leaf in a variety of ways. For instance the sound design is spectacular! One of the best sounding games on the Switch system, if not the best overall. There are some things however that are cause for controversy, such as the local multiplayer issue, in which the ""leader"" is pretty much the only one who gets to do anything, while any one else can collect materials, they go to the recycling bin in the resident services tent/building, which is fine till you realize that anyone can access that, and take the other players stuff, and to top it off the second player can't take it till either they are the leader, or they boot up the game by themselves. Another setback is the exclusion of cloud saves/backups. While Nintendo has stated that there will be a way to get your island back in the case of console loss or theft, it has not to my knowledge been implemented yet. So basically  for now say your console got stolen, you would lose all of your progress, and as someone who has accidentally lost their save game, it is not a great time building back up what you lost. So, in conclusion the game is sub-par... just kidding this is the best selling Animal Crossing for a reason, if you have the means to purchase this game DO, you will not regret it, just keep in mind some of the disappointing aspects of the game, and try to keep your console itself safe! I know that times are rough right now, so I just wanted to say to any one who actually reads this, if you can't afford the game do NOT go out of your way to buy it, save your money for food and other living costs! Stay safe, and have fun!"
LoganJ07,"Apr 22, 2020",9,"This game is amazing! I played the original, New Leaf, and now this, and I can see where they upgraded its quality. It's beautiful, creative, and so original, its an all out great game. People who rate the game 0 or 2 because of its problem that you can't own more than 1 world on 1 Nintendo Switch are people who haven't gotten the full experience, and also ignorant people who didn't think to look up the details of the actual game. Play singleplayer, and it's the best thing ever. I would've rated it a ten, but no, this problem is bad and all, but a 0 or 2 rating because of the multiplayer being messed up is just not right. The game released last month, an update could be put out and could improve multiplayer. Besides the one problem, this game is one of my favorites on the Switch so far."

Rosscoe,"Apr 22, 2020",2,"Made this account specifically to warn people about the nefarious business tactics that are underpinning the cute aesthetics.

If you plan on playing this game with other people in your household on a single switch then think again as that really isn’t possible. Only 1 game/island per switch, not per profile. Additional profiles can only visit the 1st players game and cannot start their own. This is a conscious design decision by Nintendo to try and force households to purchase a console for every member of household. So it’s not £50 for the game. It’s actually the amount of people in your household x (£50 + £200). A rip off basically.

Sort it out Nintendo, you know you’ve done this deliberately and could easily fix it"

That is how you have to share one island per console, and only the person who arrives on the island first gets the full game experience. I don't understand why Nintendo would do that, and it ruins the experience for many people including my sister who joined the island second. It just seems greedy to me!"
Froggie,"Apr 21, 2020",3,"I’ve bought this game for playing solo, and seeing how pretty much everyone enjoys it that way, I thought I would too. And to my disappointment, it was such a chore that it became boring after two weeks of playing.
Some of the aspects that killed the game for me:

1. Grind. I initially expected the game to be kind of similar to **** Valley. There, you were always rewarded for everything: catching new species, donating items to the museum, talking and giving gifts to the villagers (aka getting cutscenes and gifts).
What is the situation like in ACNH? Want to travel to mystery islands (actually a one very cool feature), want some cool hairstyles? You gotta get nook miles. And in order to get them, you’re given the most enjoyable tasks ever imaginable: chop 10 trees, catch 10 bugs, sell 20 weed. It was getting so tedious I wanted to CRY. People actually spend 60$ on this and enjoy it??

Museum is actually really beautiful on the inside, I did not expect it at first. But the sensation wears off real quick, because essentially it’s all this game is about - looks. Nothing rewarding in terms of gameplay.

2. Villagers. Again, can be pretty, but they all have the same cookie cutter cutter cute and lovely personality. Maybe it’s me who’s got so unlucky, i don’t know. But you can develop even characters like this, but all I got is some copy paste bs monologue about how that one likes to sleep and eat, and that other one likes to lift weights. Amazing.

3. The time you have to spend to do such routine like buying or selling. Like honestly, do I REALLY need  to stop to read greetings every time I walk into the shop, followed by ANOTHER line when I try to talk to them?? To then watch how my character hands them the goods, and they talk pointlessly??
Optimize the menus for god’s sake and stop making everything so slow. You can make immersive game without trying to artificially drag out things like selling, buying and crafting, especially when you’re doing it so frequently...

4. It was actually partially my fault for not reading about the game enough, but real time synchronization is stupid. You want to build a home, a bridge, or literally anything? Wait for one day. Want to see new clothes? Wait one day. Want to have fun right now? Unlucky for you, wait one day.
I could get behind this idea if it wouldn’t have hindered me from doing what I want when I want. Why can’t I move quickly with the game if I want to? Why is this game forcing one play style on everyone?

I know you can time travel, which I usually do, even though it kinda feels like cheating. And you know why? Because if you do that, it’s extremely apparent that the game relies on that real time gimmick to be interesting. It severely lacks any real content.
I believe you will enjoy the ACNH if you like customizing stuff, because it’s one thing the game is objectively good at.

All in all,  I really, REALLY tried to like this game. But you can only catch bugs for so long."
TheBrosOnTheNet,"Apr 21, 2020",8,"Animal Crossing hasn't changed that much over time, but this title really rapresents the core of the franchise: chill, customize your island, have fun with friends. The graphics are stunning and the Nook Miles sistem works very well. I'm sure that thanks to the many updates and patches that Nintendo promised us, all the problems will be solved."
MrSiera,"Apr 21, 2020",0,only one real save-game is possible per switch... makes sense from a business point of view ($$$$) - unacceptable for customers.
greenybarn,"Apr 21, 2020",1,"First, let me concede that the game is really fun BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE PLAYING SOLO!

The fact that the progress of second-and-additional players is limited by the progress of the first player is a showstopper for this game ever becoming a classic.  The Switch offers multiple separate user profiles so that games can be, well, separate.  The forced sharing of an island and the fact that the island rep gets game features that the other players don't get ruins the experience for any family/roommates//etc. that are using the same console.  The option to share an island should be just that: an option.  If in my own profile I want my own island with my own game experience, that should be possible.  I enjoyed the game for a few hours until I realized how limited I was by being player 2 and now there is no motivation to play any further."
hardwAy11,"Apr 21, 2020",0,Only one island per system alowed. Being the second player ****. I don't want to be forced to buy another console.
Widfar,"Apr 21, 2020",0,"If I spend 60€ on a new game, I expect to be fully able to play it in its fully features. It's unacceptable that you can't create more than one island per switch. It's like Fifa asking you a new Xbox only to start a new career. It should be clearly stated that this game is for only one player and any additional player to enjoy a full experience should get a new console. That said I'm really glad I got a refund and I'll consider give this game another chance if, and only if an update comes out fix this mess."
Ljones86,"Apr 21, 2020",2,"Sad I've felt like I had to give this score but inevitable. I'm a parent and also gamer, bought this for our whole family to play similar to how we did on new leaf. Sharing islands isn't an issue for us it makes it more enjoyable, the games quaint and addictive, with one MAJOR flaw. You cannot hold multiple islands like on new leaf with game save data.
The saves for this game do not save to profile save date or to memory cards but directly to the console meaning multiple world is completely off the table. Not a huge problem some people say. Well, when my 6 year old was made thiwr avatar first it became an issue.  They don't play as much as myself and husband of course and us mainly being responsible for the building of the town's and helping our younger chikdren gather materials etc just became a nightmare: even more so that only the primary character can accept any quests. Therefore in order to all play and build our own characters means we either have to progress our 6 year olds character beyond what they are after or sacrifice our own progression. Badly thought put system."
Nina11,"Apr 21, 2020",4,"Although the game is cute and can be quite addictive even though I enjoy playing it there are a lot à things that could be improved .. I find that they put little effort  into the story line.. I am new to the animal crossing universe and brought this game to see what the fuss was all about and was soon dispointed.. The game play feels more like a game you'd get on the app store, you have to wait till the next day to progress which gets a bit frustrating and the story line was rather short. Also the amount of menus/dialogue get really repetative and tedious too."
neel603,"Apr 21, 2020",5,"For the most part this game is really good but if you have one switch console in your house and have multiple people who want to play this game then it **** for anyone who isn't the first player.

Biggest **** up of 2020."
OwenlyTheBest,"Apr 21, 2020",7,"Love the game but it can't be understated how ludicrous the one island per switch limitation is.

The fact that only one island can exist per console (not per account) is a deal breaker. Our Switch is shared between my sister and I, and this single element ruined the whole game. I don't understand how the producers  even thought this would be a good idea!

Thanks for ruining what could have been game of the year."

NoxiD20,"Apr 20, 2020",0,"Not only can I not have my own island, I can’t progress in the game until my wife hits certain milestones in the game. I spent 8 hours playing the game trying to figure out why I didn’t have an axe yet and it was because she didn’t show a NPC two bugs... straight trash designed to sell consoles. HARD PASS."
7Swords,"Apr 20, 2020",0,"This game is not a multiplayer game. Only the first player will be able to fully enjoy the game, since they will be the mayor, the other who start playing later will not be able to decide how the island will develop, since they will be forced to live on the same island.
1 Island per profile Nintendo! This is a blatant attempt to force consumers to buy more systems, stop being so greedy!"
DutyStalker,"Apr 20, 2020",2,"Ok so I actually created my MC account just to review this game. I read it had been review bombed on here so bought it anyway despite all the bad reviews, after owning for a week I can actually believe there would be that many negative reviews it is really disappointing. Me and my daughter hammered **** valley for hours/days on end she has been so excited for this to replace it. The gfx are better and as a single player game she says its ok, but the multi player game they really dropped the ball so you can only have one island per console. At first I didn't think this was too much an issue we could both play on that island although I would have liked to have a separate island under my user account I can progress and send my character to hers it's not possible. One progressing player PER CONSOLE. Basically if you are the person playing with the island owner everything you do is pointless, items you pick up go straight in the island recycle bin. So you can switch leader but this is just covering up the fact this is equally pointless as what's the point nothing you do matters you may be able to access your nook phone as leader but then the other person's stuff just goes straight in the recycle bin instead. It's sad as my daughter is 8 she loves us playing games together she wants me to play this but it's just mind numbingly boring for the second player. The second player can pick items up they go straight in the town recycling bin so unless you want to run all way back there the leader may as well pick everything up as you are never more than a few steps away from each other as you as sharing the same screen, I basically spent hours just following her around like a dog on a lead, and every time I pick my damn bone up it vanishes into the village bin and only my owner can pick it out, following her doing absolutely nothing you can't even explore as you get teleported right next to them when you reach the edge of the screen. I can tell she's disappointed when I say you just play on your own but Jesus there is only so many hours you can spend pointlessly walking around after someone with no purpose what so ever and if you do get involved and pick some items up you have to walk all way back the town centre to pick them up and even then only the leader can access them so I pick them up we walk all way to town Square then she picks them out she even said I may as well pick them up in first place because then we don't have to run back and forth. I think to call this a multiplayer game at all is a disgrace. I'm not a review bomber just a very disappointed dad. We bought it for multiplay and we are playing **** valley again a week later that cost us £10 years ago. I tried to keep the review serious but multiplayer is a joke so we had 5min fun her making me out silly outfits on, apart from that I honestly have had more fun playing with the old paperclip Microsoft office assistant. Everything switch seems to be a cash cow theese days, Nintendo asking £59 for mario kart 8 deluxe still which is just a rehash of mario kart 8 that came out 7 or so years ago on their last gen console and super Mario Bros u ""Deluxe"", some crook in Nintendo saying yes let's take our old game bang deluxe on the end and re release it still for top money on the new console. I will not be buying another Nintendo game system. It's only getting 2 stars as a single player game it's alright but only one player can play single player unless you buy another switch and another game as all the other user accounts have to use the same island only the island owner can progress on. Just glad my other child is 2 and doesn't understand as I would be livid at the thought of having to buy another switch and game so he could play single player as well what a damn disgrace  I am utterly disgusted with this money grabbing joke ****. Bottom line want a fun game to play with your kids get **** valley or Minecraft might be old but just as good and the price is spot on value for what you get. This game replaces nothing, better yet get a Windows 95 pc and have a conversation with the office assistant. PATHETIC... PATHETIC!!!!"
PurpleLemonHead,"Apr 20, 2020",1,"This game is AWFUL. I purchased it for my 4 year old daughter thinking she could have a game that would allow her to create spaces. It looked pretty, cute, and easy to navigate. It isn't. It requires the user to be able to read (which is not the average 4 year old) and it's WORDY. Everything a character says is some lengthy explanation of what to do next. There's no action. It's boring. Complete waste of $64. Anything I purchase for the Switch going forward will be from the Mario genre. Don't waste your money on Animal Crossing."
Weko_13,"Apr 20, 2020",0,"You stole my money. You didn't advise that this game was only for 1 player. Nintendo Switch is a family console, so it's so annoying that there is no way to play more than 1 person. The other players are just spectators that cant evolve while the main player is the only one that can make progress in the game. If this is a way to make people buying more switches, YOU ARE **** ROBBERS"
68Dube,"Apr 20, 2020",4,This game doesn’t allow multiple save files. The switch is not a handheld device. That is what the DS line is for. It is a console. Spending 300$ on a DS is absurd. So to say I need a second switch to have my own file is also absurd. Big swing and a miss (and easily fixed) Nintendo!
gun661,"Apr 20, 2020",4,"""#1 Best Switch Game of 2020"". Catch 10.000 fish in a minigame that requires 2 A-button presses, catch 10.000 bugs in a minigame that requires 1 A-button press, chop 10.000 wood, mine 10.000 ore, dig for 10.000 fossils, and pop 10.000 balloons/lootboxes for rare pieces of furniture. Click through the same repeating speech bubbles when interacting with your NPC villagers. Later in Animal Crossing: New Horizons you can also edit the layout of your 3D-level, piece by piece. One of the ""best games of 2020"" is a cumbersome 3D-level-editor in which you have to do busy work to gather randomly appearing 3D models of furniture, dress up your character, and outfit an empty museum which probably no one but yourself will visit. This whole ""game"" is like outfitting an empty museum which will never be visited by many interested visitors. That's about it, that is the extent of interaction this game provides - for the ""multiplayer"" part see almost every other review. The only feature that made me play this game 5 minutes a day for several days is the ""skinner box"", i.e. the variable rewards, i.e. the chance that maybe a rare piece of furniture appears in one of the balloons/lootboxes or in one of the ingame stores. But after you've placed your rare piece of furniture and after you've equipped your new fancy hat, there's just nothing much to do but grinding and looking at good looking 3D items."
mikabuns,"Apr 20, 2020",1,"Everyone seems to be complaining about the '1 island per console' problem, which is frustrating, but since I have no one to share my console with I don't have that problem. What I do have a problem with is the game itself, it's way too grindy and doesn't offer me a 'relaxing' experience like others claim. I find myself actually getting stressed more because I can't find the materials I need to proceed, for example, 30 iron nuggets to build the shop. There are 3 stones on my island and not 1 gave me an iron nugget, meaning I have to constantly spend Nook Miles to go to other islands so I can get them, it took me multiple days just to complete that task due to bad RNG. And don't get me started on the 3 plot stuff...6 items per plot, and some of the materials needed for said items I cannot get on my island at all, which means MORE grinding for Nook Miles to travel to other islands for them to potentially not even have the materials I need. I just want to be able to have villagers on my island without having to constantly grind.

I'll give it to Nintendo that the animal residents are adorable. It's why I was dragged to the game in the first place, which looking back was a huge mistake. With all the content it has, I can see why it's being sold for £50, but the gameplay itself doesn't make up for it. If you want a game like Minecraft that has cute, interactive animal villagers and 10x more grinding for materials, then this game is absolutely for you. But sadly, it was not for me at all."

This is a very questionable design choice and seems borderline predatory as an attempt to pressure families into buying multiple switch consoles."
HiShaun,"Apr 20, 2020",0,"Can't actually play the game because I wasn't the first player to play it.

clovisleoncio,"Apr 20, 2020",0,"Bought this game to play with my wife as it is supposed to support local coop. Not only the local coop is a joke as the player who is not the leader basically can't to anything but if you're not the first player to run the game and be the representative you won't get to actually play the game.
Now I still don't have a game to play with my wife as she is the only one who can play it."
SirPigeon,"Apr 20, 2020",5,"I don't understand why this game is so highly praised, after about a month of owning it I can say its 'just okay'.

When you start the game, you're drawn in by the charm of the character designs and the laid back feeling. You aren't pressed for time and can do what you want. I spent my first two weeks catching a wide variety of creatures to fill the museum, creating my own house and trying to make money.

However, I then spent the next two weeks doing the exact same thing.
You need allot of money to progress in this game, so you're going to have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell. Once you upgrade your house you are then presented with another option to upgrade (progress in the game, essentially) so you'll have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell so you can get another upgrade and do the same thing again and again.

This isn't just limited to the main game either, filling out the museum requires you to spend hours catching fish and bugs over and over and finding fossils (you have high chances to keep getting creatures and fossils you've found before).

The character dialogue? repeating. You start to notice the same dialogue being used over and over after about a week or so of playing, and while that may be fine normally this is a game that's supposed to be some sort of long term investment and is praised for its supposed 'small details' and charm, which I found ran out after the first week as the game kept trying to repeat the same tricks over and over to try and impress and engage me. This game is essentially a one trick pony, after the initial 'wow' there's not much left to be impressed by.

Its fun at first but everything about this game screams repetition, its more like a chore than a fun game.

I can't really recommend this game, its not the worst game I've ever played, but its just dreadfully boring."
YouDontKnowMu,"Apr 20, 2020",3,"This game is a farming game, but every farming feature is lame, nothing is made to help the player, you perpetually asking you to switch your items, you don't know if your stuff is broken, you can't split a stack of items with the size you want.

Ommug,"Apr 20, 2020",0,Nintendo games are really going down hill and the problem is the fact that people are buying there games due to nostalgia before there parents where divorced. Pocket camp is a better game then what i waited all these years for. The animals have no personality of their own and the online system is absolutely garbage. the only way you should see the plane is when its local play is being used after that it is just bad coding like it was coded to be this bad.  i give it a 5 because i did have a bit of fun but beyond that i think this is just Nintendo being lasy af and just riding us out on nostalgia.
Conmaxanhle,"Apr 20, 2020",10,People is full of **** on this review. Buy your own game and do not think about you can pay 1 get 2. Game is awsome btw
yhusi,"Apr 20, 2020",0,"The policy of one island per Switch console is an inexcusable deal breaker for any family with more than one family member, or for that matter for any person wanting to re-play the game for a different experience at a later time without deleting old saves. Bad excuses of anti cheating or whatever are just red herrings, since such measures can be implemented in other ways without breaking the game. It is obvious this is just a cheap way of Nintendo forcing the players to buy more consoles."
alecnichols,"Apr 19, 2020",0,NINTENDO! FIX THIS! This one island deal is an outrage. Can anyone tell me of another game that has ever done this? Sorry but I'm not buying a second switch so that my wife can play this game for like two months and then wait for the next bandwagon game to catch on.
GodOfWar05,"Apr 19, 2020",0,Can only have one island per Switch. Bad multiplayer design on a Switch with multiple users.
JdogGames,"Apr 19, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an extremely relaxing game. Like the games before it, you are moved into a small town and make it a thriving community. Though previous games had multiplayer, New Horizons does it extremely well. If you have patience, it is extremely satisfying"
Andydoo,"Apr 19, 2020",9,"This is, overall, a really great experience. I can say in full confidence that you will like this game. Even if you think you won't; in fact, this game probably has the most positive impact on people who don't think they'll like it. From the perspective of someone who's played every game in the series since the DS, I can also vouch for this one is easily the best.

Aside from some minor inconveniences and one really major inconvenience I'll get to in a minute, this game's new ideas shine. There's a lot of quality-of-life changes, but in typical Animal Crossing fashion, it's still kinda bad. For example, you don't have to worry about waiting for furniture to show up in the store because you can craft them as many times as you want whenever you want, so long as you have the materials to do so. But you can't craft the same thing in bulk, so if you have 19 manilla clams, you're gonna have to wait through 19 animations and select the options 19 times. It's not a huge deal, but it's a bummer. It's still not easy to time-travel, which I understand makes me automatically the worst person on Earth and the bane of some Tumblr users' existence, but it really should be made much easier to allow people to play the game the way they want to play it. Especially since the solution to not being able to sell things after the stores close is... not good. It's bad. It ****. You just have to wait until the shop opens to get 80% of the bells you would've made if you'd just waited until the morning to hand it to the shop owners directly, so it completely misses the point. But again, it's really not that big a deal.

That stuff holds it back from a perfect 10 out of 10, but the good absolutely outweighs the bad here. I've told this to each of my friends individually, and I'll say it again: buy this game. Do it."
TY1996,"Apr 19, 2020",8,"the dialogue can be a bit repetitive but overall this is a great game to play, I am the only player on my switch so not being able to have multiple islands is not a problem for me. visiting other island via internet is very seamless in my experience, definitely a good upgrade from new leaf and previous versions out there."
thatkiddonovan,"Apr 19, 2020",0,"This is a real disappointment for me. The game just isn’t meant to be played by more than one person at a time. The limitation of “One island per console” makes it a lackluster experience for anyone who isn’t the founder of the island. I’m finding that, if I let my wife play first, when I get into my account there’s nothing left for me to do. It’s pretty slimy to make people spend $250-500 extra on top of the $60 price of the game to make their own island. Nintendo is losing my respect here. Always knew Sony and Microsoft didn’t care about the user experience, just how much money they make. It’s an even playing field now, I guess."
tailblazer,"Apr 19, 2020",0,"The game only allows ONE ISLAND per switch console. This means I can't truly play the game, as my wife made an account first. Now I am just a side character, and whats more we have to split all the resources on the island. This was a terrible cash grab. We are not made of money and can't just afford to buy two switches for no reason. Nintendo is GREEDY. I don't think I'll be buying any Nintendo products anytime soon, seeing as they will likely have ridiculous cash grabs built into them as well."

NotoriousRPG,"Apr 19, 2020",6,"I’m beyond frustrated with this game, this is the first animal crossing I ever play, I know the new leaf players had it worst but this stressed me out.
I bought this game because everyone was raving about how awesome and relaxing it is, knowing we were going to be on lockdown I thought this was the perfect game for this! I’ve clocked many hours on **** valley so I thought this was right up my alley, but it’s not.
The first days were very entertaining, everything is new and you feel progress in the course of the initial settlement of your very own island where you are the representative! But slowly but surely you become what you are escaping from in reality, just an employee, in this case, an employee of Tom nook.

You want a bridge? Pay up
You want a ramp? Pay up
You want to relocate a building? Pay up
More storage? Pay up
Another room? Pay up
Travel to random islands? Pay up Furniture? Pay up
Clothing? Pay up

Even the things you do daily consist on a exchange of currency, if you want to relocate a tree, you have to consume fruit to be able to relocate it, your tools break so you have to constantly get materials to craft them again.

And every time you move 1 ramp, one bridge or one building it takes 1 whole real life day, yeah, it won’t be finished until 5 am the next day, 1 ramp/bridge per day, if you want to destroy and build another bridge (you can’t relocate them, you have to pay again) you have to wait til the day after tomorrow! On the positive side the game looks gorgeous, there is an IMMENSE amount of items, furniture, clothing, wallpapers, floors etc The art of the game is impecable.

But the problem is that this is a game of collecting items and decorating, it may not be for everyone, there’s not much to do story-wise after you finish paying the 5 rooms you can expand on your home and achieve a 3 rating star on your island , so you are left with decorating and collecting items, and that’s it, a beautiful shell **** with no much gameplay but shake trees and mine ores.

Also, you can’t build more than 8 ramps in your island, you can’t build ramps next to another, you can’t build a ramp that leads straight to your museum because they are made of 2 blocks and the museum is 5 blocks wide, the lack of symmetry on some parts makes me irrationally mad. The cherry on top is that you can only have 1 island per switch, the dialog is very unintuitive and the online functionality is ok but a pain if you have more than 2-3 visitors with unnecessary repetitive loading animations."
Winthorp,"Apr 19, 2020",0,"The choice to make the island binded to the SWITCH instead of the profile is unaccettable. The players 2+ are simply guest, they can't do any decision on the island, can't build any new building and can't make decisions on new guests.

JellyToast,"Apr 19, 2020",0,This is advertised as a multiplayer game but it’s not. It’s a one player game that a second person can join in and watch. Even if you decide to buy 2 switches and 2 games once you start an island with 2 people there is no way to separate the 2 or move your save files.
The_Man_With_No,"Apr 19, 2020",6,"Only first player can create an island, it is an actual issue for others, but not for me and should still be fixed. This game has a lot of charm and some fun, but a lot of the charm is stepped on by how overly tedious the game is and how terrible the programmers are on a technical side. Want to join an island with a bunch of friends and hold an event? Well, welcome to about 10 minutes of loading screens because every person who comes in NEEDS to essentially reset the island and have a giant loading screen.

It isn't just when it comes to playing online, it is just about every aspect from finding certain characters and needing to prompt dialogue with them 5x to get to the right spot (let's pretend that programmers can't make dialogue a continuous thing lol) or trying to fish and the fish moving a little bit out of your way and having to cast the line with little to no aim. You constantly miss shovel spots, hit spots, balloons, and so many things because the way the game is designed is just... very incredibly poor.

The developers basically see traditional gaming and try to piss on it, which is fine and dandy, but what's left is a technically bad game with overly tedious moments that take control of the game 95% of the play. It seems like Nintendo hired 3rd year programming students who have some help from veterans on how to get stuff done, but overall you can tell the programmers in this game are just daft and at the end of their wits, which is why it also doesn't shock me that it is one island per Switch, it's literally them being incapable of programming that logic into the game."
flickman42,"Apr 19, 2020",1,"A game geared towards being family-friendly doesn't allow each family member to experience the intended fun of creating their own island.

AddVariety,"Apr 19, 2020",0,"I give it a destroying 0 simply because Nintendo deliberately chose to make it only fun for the first player who created the island. Now my wife purchased the game and created it without knowing this, a couple of weeks into it, my son has joined the adventure only to find out he cannot make most decisions and is limited by how far my wife has progressed. I started playing to see what it was all about and indeed, it's a utterly terrible decision made by Nintendo to require you to buy 1. another switch console and 2. another ACNH copy and 3. not allow you in any way to keep your save game online and 4. not allow you to transfer the part that you've progressed to another Switch console with another game copy netting €260! So the game doesn't deserve anything more than a 0. Nintendo should feel the pain and fix this. For any other game I know it's super easy to do all those things on the same console and heck, even the free-to-play Fortnite gives me the possibility to switch between Xbox and Switch freely, the same goes with my son and we don't even need the Online membership to play online. Yet here we are with ACNH and I wouldn't be bother with the €35 additional yearly membership for a family subscription, if it would allow the full experience and not limit you to the progress of the first player, which becomes frustrating extremely quickly. And not just that, you know what the only option is for the 2nd/3rd/4th player when (in this example my wife) the first player stops liking ACNH and therefore stops playing? You might've guessed it... start completely over with a completely blank island altogether, there is no way to transfer the ownership or keep your own progress in any way. I'll keep repeating this, but this is a terrible decision by Nintendo and basically one that says: we only cater to those willing to shell out huge amounts of money on a duplicate console and a duplicate copy of the game. For that Nintendo deserves a 0 for ACNH."
Austenclyde,"Apr 18, 2020",1,The fact that they only allow one island per console is idiotic.

I’ve played every version and each time it has progressively gotten better and better. This is such a beautiful representation of how far the game has come. There are so many little details that make my heart sing like rain on windows, breeze in trees, and such elaborate shadowing and lighting. I recommend this game to everyone. Everyone should play animal crossing, young and old. It brings people together and helps you unwind when you’re feeling stressed. Its also not to get addicted to such a beautiful game."

XV_,"Apr 18, 2020",7,"Once again I was allured to Animal Crossing more than ever, it was fun, it was great, but soon, slowly but truly its charm disappeared a fair amount.

I'm not a fan of review bombing, but I'm surely counting negative aspects that a lot of people are complaining about, if not for them, this review will be easily a 9 or so, but as it is, I believe a 7 is a fair score, without further ado my thoughts are as follows:

Starting with the positive things, NH is as ever an incredible time if you're up to the task of giving your heart to it, long gone are those days when you could only customize your house, now the full island has customization, and almost every furniture or item is placeable wherever you want, and it gives a lot of freedom and customization. As it was in New Leaf where you could make public structures, like arches or statues, now they're just items like it should have from a long time ago. Another good addition is its new point system called 'Nook Miles' in which you have to meet certain requirements like achievements and you'll be rewarded with miles, this system comes as unique achievements and a daily wheel of minor achievements that can be done over and over, in contrast with past entries where at a certain point you simply turn off the game because you didn't have more things to do for that day, these miles can be exchanged for several things like furniture, clothes or unique DIY recipes, this new mechanic in form of DIY is easily one of the most enjoyable things in NH, they come as gifts from villagers, message bottles, rewards, etc, the fun part is that you need certain items to make them, so a lot of your time will be invested in acquiring items to make your recipes, pure joy.

By far, the best thing that NH has to offer is terraforming, although it has its limitations, it's easily the most entertaining addition: do you want to make your island like a crater? maybe a fortress? or how about a city? the limit is your determination and creativity (and maybe at times money), but it surely is the thing that a lot of veterans were waiting, think of it as a Minecraft ripoff, but with Animal Crossing makeover.

As for the negatives, there are a lot of issues that can be resumed into 4 main problems, at least to me, they weren't a problem at first but everything went a little downhill once you notice them. First and the most common issue for everyone is the one island per switch, when the official trailer launched and stated that this game will be multiplayer with a common island I was really into, I and my partner were daydreaming about the things and possibilities of playing co-op, turns out that the local multiplayer is more a gimmick and the second player is basically a background PC, although the biggest issue is that the only the 1st resident can advance through the ""main quest"" so good luck if your 1st resident is not as active as you. The second issue is its online mode, if you're playing with one friend is just serviceable, but if you're going to play with two or more persons (friends or internet people) you'll notice that every single time a person arrives or leaves your island, every player that is in the island have to watch an unskippable (quite long) cutscene, not only that, for some unthinkable reason, you can't navigate through menus or inventory in that particular moment, otherwise, the cutscene will be delayed. this is a serious problem particularly if you're planning to play this with several friends or if you're into the stalk market, prepare to loose 15-20 min per arrival.

My third issue is more a quality of life issue, you see, Animal Crossing have ever being a game about of time, you have to wait a lot in order to have the best of it, but, at this point, selling, buying and navigating through menus is quite a burden, not only that, there are too many nitpicks to list in here, but, certainly it seems more like the game is keeping you away from having fun, is not like there aren't a lot of things to do, so it feels more like cheap padding than anything.

The last issue and the one that I hate the most and it seems that no one is talking about, is its ""free updates"", when the first official trailer launched with its terraforming promises, it also mentioned something that bothered me a lot, the fact its main events will arrive as free updates as if they need to be charged or something, in past entries these seasonal events wherein the main game, so it feels way too worrisome that now they're extra, if this game was a MMO or online specific, I wouldn't mind but, it's more like I paid full price for a game that is not finished, so if you're like me and want to play this game in some years, good luck finding those ""free updates"".

If you took your time to read this whole thing, I appreciate it a lot, even if you agree or not, I like this game a lot and have played 100 hours to this point but, is important to address its issues."
Sanitus,"Apr 18, 2020",0,One island per SWITCH?  Inexcusable. Wish they gave refunds!  This is nothing more than a money grab.  Do not buy this game.
Valens831,"Apr 18, 2020",2,"My wife loves this game and I was super excited to find out that it had multiplayer so that my children could play together and my wife and I could.  However, I downloaded the game today and my frustration has risen many times.  First, only ONE island is allowed on the console.  What the what?!  I want to make my own design decisions and have my wife do hers and look at how things pan out.  NOPE.  Second, the first person who plays gets to make ALL important decisions, where buildings go, the shape of the island, etc.  Third, couch coop multiplayer forces only one person to be able to do worthwhile activity leaving the other players to weed and water.  This could be looked over and wouldn't even be a complaint IF we could have our own islands.  I would prefer this setup, IF we had our own islands.

If you plan on buying this game for multiple people to play, then please stop and consider these things.  I may not have purchased this game if I had known this before hand.  The video reviews I watched never brought this up.  This could have easily been a 9 or 10 if they hadn't stupidly forced people into a single way of playing.  I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY!  Okay, so, I'm obvioulsy frustrated, but I do hope this helps you understand what you might face if you buy this."

SupervisedChaos,"Apr 18, 2020",0,This is unacceptable. I cannot believe my entire family need to share an island this game is not at all worth the price tag on it. I want a refund. The only way to have an individual experience with the game is to buy another console with another cartridge. This is a disgusting marketing idea and a completely terrible game design. I wish I could give a negative for my score it’s a greedy money grab that I thought Nintendo was better than. Guess I was wrong
DUHRIZEO,"Apr 18, 2020",0,"When did Nintendo go from family friendly to mobile game devs level of scum? This game makes it so obvious that Nintendo is blatantly out to sell consoles. Every fan boy that falls for this is just making it the new standard. I'm sorry, but it's impossible to make such well put together, polished games, and have such thoughtless designs smack you at every turn without them being there on purpose. Animal crossing is built specifically to be as frustrating and restricted as possible to waste your time all while holding a better way to play behind a second console. I will NEVER support this kind of BS but sadly there are more **** that will so you can bet things will only get worse."
Libits,"Apr 18, 2020",2,"This game is very boring.  It’s the same grind everyday: Find the DIY bottle, visit villagers, and spew crap around the island waiting for a 5 star rating which gives me………….Lily of the Valley and a gold watering can?  Seriously?  Yes, I’ve built inclines and bridges, caught bugs and fish and picked fruit until I want to puke.

The islands to visit are a joke.  There’s no sharks or exotic bugs and every single island I’ve visited (9 in total) has had the same fruit as my native island.

In ACNL, there were lofty goals: Get the Emporium, pass Gracie’s clothing check, upgrade all the shops and museum.  Maybe those are some of the goals in NH, too, but the game is too boring to keep playing and find out.

What a shame."

Frap_gadz,"Apr 18, 2020",0,"I'm sure the game is amazing if you're the 1st player, my wife is definitely having a blast, however as the 2nd player on the same console the game is extremely disappointing. It honestly feels like you're nothing more than an NPC on another player's island.

Leo5052,"Apr 17, 2020",0,"The online play is dreadful. Do you want to stare at a loading screen for 20 minutes for every 3 minutes of play? Do you want a nonsensical chat interface that requires you to use your cellphone? That's ACNH online.

Why in the world does every player need to exit out of all menus and interactivity every time a new player joins or leaves?  Seriously, this actually happens. You will be prompted to close whatever menu or window you are in so that you can wait for the game to autosave and then display a loading screen that can take as many as five minutes to load.

Why does the game crash if a player gets sick of this garbage and leaves without using the airport?

Why is it impossible to join a game on an island if even a single player on that island is active with a task?

Why are second players treated like second class citizens? Different profiles on the same switch should have the option to play on their own island.

Games have been offering seamless online experiences for YEARS. What a huge failure on the part of Nintendo. You're seriously telling me you couldn't get someone from Rockstar for GTA, any Counterstrike clone, any fighting game, or WOW to help you build this? Shame on you Nintendo. This is an awful letdown for what could have been an all time great game.

Online play is unplayable. Even more inexcusable since Nintendo charges for the privilege of watching that f****** loading screen for hours.

The online experience needs to be completely rebuilt and patched before anything else.  Second is something to address the fact that second profiles on the same Switch are powerless to do anything in game. A very distant third would be addressing the clunky crafting system.

Fix the netplay. Please. Its so bad. Netplay **** - *HOLD ON WHILE I WATCH THIS LOADING SCREEN* - Like I said Netplay *EXIT THIS TEXT BOX SO WE CAN SHOW THE LOADING SCREEN* *HERE'S THE LOADING SCREEN* - Netplay blows. Fix it."

amphibianalien,"Apr 17, 2020",0,"Overall the game is fun and enjoyable. If you were to play the game for 20 minutes a day and didn't care about multiplayer features, local or online, then you could probably enjoy the game. However, the game is bogged down with hundreds of tiny flaws that combine to create an overall frustrating experience. With each new Switch game that releases it becomes increasingly more apparent that Nintendo simply doesn't understand how to design a game or what their players want. Nintendo is worse than EA because at least EA games aren't $60 seven years after release. Nintendo can't deliver what its players want in a game. They keep releasing titles with the philosophy of ""we know best,"" and it doesn't lead to fun gameplay."

RagnarX213,"Apr 17, 2020",3,"Absolutely MEH

Like most Switch owners, I was very excited for this release.  I felt like this would be a great game to enjoy with the wife and our 8 year old daughter.  The game looks very cute and the characters are adorable.  The graphics are easily the biggest +. The concept itself is great but the execution is just terrible.  This game was released before it was finished.  Its as simple as that.  This is not a complete game.  There isn't really any campaign which is just preposterous. It would have been so easy to send your character on a variety of cute quests to help the islands residents, but no... Everything about this game, aside from the graphics need to be refined.  It feels like no one tested this game before it was released.  There is a long list of issues that should have been fixed prior to release.  No option to craft multiple items (unbelievable).  Not enough resources to craft things (even if youre prepared to grind).  Terrible controls for building (its a crafting game but you feel very limited in what you can do and where you can place things).  Not enough quests.  Seriously just preposterous.  Even the mobile version of this game has better quests.  All you do is keep paying off enormous loans to build up your house, its just an endless grind that isn't very creative or innovative.  This game is the definition of half-baked. I wont even get into the fact that its only one island per console.  In my opinion Dragon Quest Builders II is a much better game if you want to play a crafting type game.  There are just so many things about this game that aggravate me when its being touted as a game that is enjoyable and relaxing.  I guess I will give it a 3 because of the beautiful graphics, otherwise I would be hard pressed to pay $20 for this half baked rubbish"
Endlessninja,"Apr 17, 2020",0,0 for forcing players to share an island for no other reason than to encourage multiple console purchases. games have had multiple save file slots for virtually all of gaming history. there is no explanation other than greed.
ch4ndler,"Apr 17, 2020",0,"My brother and I were super excited for this game, until we bought it and found out we would not be able to have our own islands. You may say that we should’ve known this before purchasing, but the Switch has multiple profiles, therefore leading us to believe we could have multiple save files, just like every other Switch game. We now share a character in order for us to both share Resident Representative duties, but we would much rather have our own personal islands. We are very disappointed that Nintendo would do such a greedy thing in order to sell more consoles."

Mhaaad,"Apr 17, 2020",0,"This game is EMPTY and only allows one island per console, these are my issues with it.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons's release date was pushed back 9 months, but a lot of fans said they would prefer the game to be pushed back more than releasing the game incomplete. So far, this game is EMPTY! all you do is collect furniture and items and recipes to make furniture and items!
New Leaf was full of things to do and goals to reach and achieve unlike this game.

I think it should have been called: AC: Happy Island Designer. the glorified version of AC: HHD.
all the praise from reviewers (Gamespot, IGN, ...etc) is getting on my nerve.

anyway, since there is nothing more to do in this game, I gave the stirch to my sister to start her game, and what do you know! SHE CAN'T HAVE HER OWN ADVENTURE UNLESS I DELETE MY SAVE FILE!! WTF NINTENDO? i PAID 60$ FOR THIS EMPTY GAME!"

Feberhuber,"Apr 17, 2020",1,"Despite a few glaring flaws, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a good game IF you have got it for yourself. As this is not the case for every human being on our planet, the story doesn't end here:

The fact, that you cannot have more than one island per console is definetly a deal-breaker and rather despicable. Doing so was a conscious and calculated decicion by Nintendo, considering that having more islands was possible on previous versions. Charging 60 € or whatever currency you're using is far from okay and nothing but a shameless cash-grab. I do think that Nintendo deserves significant hate for their decicion and also think that my score is justified for this reason: A game, that forces family members to be some kind of slaves to whoever happened to start the game, does not deserve any rating above five and considering that there are many other things (visiting friends is difficult, villager dialogue is repetitive) I will not be ashamed of considering this to be a bad game overall."

Who decided that was a good idea??????? Why not one island per account?!?!?! Or something that makes sense for a console. They designed the game like it was for the ds. It made sense on the ds because normally that isn’t a shared console. BUT THE SWITCH IS MEANT TO BE SHARED!!!! SO WHY CAN ONLY ONE PERSON MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS?????????? A great game series with a horrible idea by Nintendo. I am very disappointed. IT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED SO EVERYONE ACCOUNT HAS THEIR OWN ISLAND!!!!

We enjoyed it a lot for a few days, until it turned out that I, as a second player, can't progress on the main quest on the island and really don't have any purpose. I had to order a second Switch console to be able to play this game, and now it is much more enjoyable. After playing with two separate switches I kinda see why it is the way it is. And having a separate console I can enjoy playing games on my own again. I was actually missing that a lot."
McTPA,"Apr 17, 2020",0,I have 2 kids but only one can actually play the game.  The other can just follow.   There is only one island per console so only one kid’s story progresses.  The other child can just follow and there are some tools they can’t even get because of no story progression.  You basically need 1 console and 1 game per child.  This seems like a way for Nintendo to force people into buying extra systems and games while everyone is stuck at home due to pandemic.   Shame on you Nintendo!!!

kamhagh,"Apr 17, 2020",4,"as someone who really loved **** Valley I was really excited to try this game but honestly it's been disappointing. SPECIALLY for 60$ if this game was 30$~ My rating would be say 6.
let me say that the first week of my game play was absolutely a blast and very fun!
but after a week? the real time clock soon turned into an annoyance rather than a good thing.
and the game feels like a chore. constantly spamming and clicking buttons to get wood and water my flowers as I don't even pay attention and read stuff online. I thought to myself after a while ""what even is the point?""

i start my morning by just water my flowers which with the bad controls takes a long time. then I chop some trees and pick fruits. by then i'm so exhausted and bored that I don't even bother with anything else. there simply isn't much to do. **** Valley leaves a lot to explore and do!

the controls aren't nice. I don't like how you have to wait for the flowers to sparkle to tell if they're watered . with a lot nearby it's not a nice way. a lot of the mechanics like donating to the museum feel so unrewarding. I feel no reason to do it. unlike **** valley that I donated every first of any item I got there.

**** valley is simply 20x better and costs less than half as much when not on sale.
it started of very fun but they haven't managed to make the tasks rewarding. there's just something about the animations the speed of them and the rewards that you get for them that makes this game not fun. and I LOVE games like this. farming stuff and the type where you get stuff and unlock more new stuff. this is my fav genre of games so it's not a ""I only like call of duty"" kind of issue, They just haven't made it work well for me. But a lot of my friends absolutely love it so yeah. It sadly doesn't have a demo. but a demo would be unfair since the first week of this game is actually fun since your'e showered with new items and don't have much time consuming but boring tasks to do."
Stew22,"Apr 17, 2020",3,"I have the same issues with this game as most of the negative reviewers have had.  The one island per one switch, only the first player can advance the game, the second player is basically the first player's **** boy, and the one thing that really pisses me off is that after a few ****'s just boring.  I know it's a slow paced life sim, but damn, after 20 to 30 minutes I'm done doing things for the day.  It's 2020 and ACNH is on the Nintendo Switch, but the game just seems like it is either unfinished or has less content to keep you interested each day than New Leaf.  It's not horrible, but after hearing all the hype about playing together with friends, you would think you could actually play and build things together with your friends instead of this ""I am in charge and you will do all my bidding at my pace"" crap."

awi,"Apr 16, 2020",9,"I do love this game, very much, but there are a LOT of clunky things that I’m disappointed to see. Considering almost all of the reviews on here are about the inability to create multiple islands on one console, I won’t cover that (and it wasn’t an issue for me, as I’m the only person who uses my Switch). However, I have a lot of other disappointments. I won’t go over the things I love because the critics covered it all—everything they said is definitely true. This is by far the best Animal Crossing yet, despite the huge flaws. I’m very disappointed to see that there’s no way to access your storage outside of your home. The storage is much better than before, don’t get me wrong—you can store much more, and the game auto-sorts your stuff for you. Character customization and clothing customization is far better than ever. But when you add crafting, several things need to be changed. Even in previous games, you could access your storage through either the post office or train station. Considering you can place items which used to link to your storage (dressers, chests, etc) out in your island now, why can’t you use those to access storage? I know this wouldn’t be “realistic,” but Animal Crossing isn’t exactly about realism. The multiplayer is clunky as hell, too. Connection has been pretty bad every time I play, and the longass animation whenever people join or leave is AWFUL. If you want to play with more than one friend at once, you’re out of luck. Not to mention that if someone tries to leave, and others don’t “close their windows” (aka, menus or conversations), a ten second timer will tick down. If it hits 0, the person trying to leave will go home with an error code and lose EVERYTHING they did while on the island, as well as everyone else losing what they got while interacting with the player. This is absolutely horrendous and makes no sense to me. Players can essentially sabotage others if they want to using this. Also, the restrictions on what you can do while others are over is annoying. Why can’t I rearrange furniture when someone’s over? Why can’t I order catalog items? It’s infuriating, particularly the inability to move things around your island or home. The crafting system and shops also sorely need updates. Why can’t I craft more than one thing at once? Why do some of my DIY recipes require that I know other DIY recipes? Why can’t I use a slider to buy however many flower seeds I want, like when buying turnips from Daisy Mae? Why can’t I buy more than one shirt or pants at the Able Sisters? It never feels good to sit there and watch the crafting animation 30 times in a row because you’re just trying to make fish bait to catch a rare fish. This should be much, much easier to do. There are some little improvements I love—the drop-off box for selling items is great, and I like the way flowers are handled, as well as the terraforming. But why are custom paths still able to be destroyed with the B button (the same button for picking up items, mind you), and why can other people destroy them? If you’re going to add paths to the game, and the ability to literally pave custom paths using this path tool, why don’t they act like paths? The game is certainly not worth a 0/10, it’s fantastic, but all of these small issues are a huge disappointment."

ArronTheG,"Apr 16, 2020",10,"Don't listen to these garbage user reviews complaining about the same one problem over and over again.  One island really isn't bad.  Also, giving the game a bad review for having no multiplayer progression is just as bad.  The solo experience is well worth it.  You should look at this game for what it is in total.  Animal Crossing:  New Horizons is a very enjoyable life sim.  It could even be called the greatest Animal Crossing game out there.  The basic principles in this game are the same as the other games.  You pay off debt, do daily tasks, get villagers, catch bugs, and all the rest.  Like in New Leaf, you can make stuff like bridges and ramps.  However, New Horizons adds new customization to your island.  In this game, you can move buildings around and decide where all of the buildings get built.  Crafting is new, and it is a very nice addition.  You can only craft one item at a time, which ****, but having the ability to make stuff is a welcome feature.  This game is amazing, and you will spend hundreds of hours into it without realizing it.  So don't listen to the 5.2 user score on this website;  It's the result of a bunch of angry people bringing a great game down for a petty reason.  This game is fun, relaxing, charming, and just overall a good time.  Give this game a shot, and I'm sure you'll love it."
Wincha1,"Apr 16, 2020",0,"If you plan on playing this on a shared switch device, you're in for a nasty surprise. whoever starts the game is the main player with ALL the control of the island.  All other players who are created afterwards, are forced to join Main player's island and CANNOT progress if the Main player doesn't progress. There is no way to switch who the Main player is.  I mistakenly let my younger daughter play first since she was excited to try.  Now my other older child (who i originally bought it for) is so angry that she cannot progress in the game and has to log into younger childs account and put in extra hours to progress in the game.  Then younger child gets angry that older child has changed things on her account, and fighting ensues!!!  BAD DESIGN ON THIS NINTENDO!  So then I buy another switch thinking it will solve this problem but there is NO WAY to transfer her game data to the new switch and she doesn't want to start over!!  ARRRGH. way to swindle me into more money."
Filo71,"Apr 16, 2020",0,"I have 5 nintendo consoles and have played at least 30 years with them. This is, without a doubt, the game that has most disappointed and boring me. Only the first player to connect to the game receives missions to advance, with the following players having to wait until the main player unlocks new buildings, characters and tools. All achievements and rewards go to the first player too, how fun !! The interaction with the animal npc is more limited and, in general, it seems to me (despite the supposed new improvements) more boring than previous versions"
DaLawUK,"Apr 16, 2020",8,"This is a hard one to score, Two different scores for time travelling and non.

5/10 non
8/10 TT

Usually this would be the other way around right? because if you don't skip days then you have more to do over time. At the same time correct and incorrect. This is from a time travellers perspective though.

For time travellers they are able to skip to any day of the year and be able to catch fish/bugs that are meant for that time of year. Games come out so frequently nowadays that you could end up forgetting you even have Animal crossing to play when another game comes out that your absorbed into. So being a time traveller you can put so much time into the game so quickly and be able to get as much possible from it without having to do so much waiting. I Time travelled and i sunk in an easy 100 hours doing stuff and enjoyed most of it. From doing all this i found some stuff that could affect a casual non TT playthrough.

The waiting days has been in since the begining but in this game its next level, theres alot more you have to wait days to do. Which means alot less of being able to play while waiting for these. Everything is IRL time based, so its not even like you can spend time trying to finish your collections because you have to wait for that during times of the year. So combining it all it just makes less to do rather than more. Its more over time, this game is perfect for you if you can only sink in a couple hours a day. Its really not even hard to get money in this, so you can do everything you need to do in a couple hours each day. Theres no more burrying your shovel to get golden either with this new recipe thing, so you now have to do something that comes randomly each week and you have to do it 30 times. Which is another you having to wait day by day to check if that persons there. The amount of waiting you have to do has been increased by around double, which imo isnt a good thing as like i said games come out alot and you can just end up forgetting about your island. I never felt like this in the past couple of games and they still had all this in, just less of it.

The local multiplayer really needs some work for the next game, should be two completely different save files and only join each others island if your both logged in at the same time and P1's island is the one you go to. I don't really local multiplayer though so this doesn't really affect me as much.

All that really comes down to this is there is just alot more waiting in this one and for someone that wants to spend 10 hours on this with a day off work. You are going to get bored as the game is constantly at a dead end. Someone that can only fit in a couple hours a day this is perfect for you."
WarMonkey87,"Apr 16, 2020",0,"This game is awful. For So. Many. Reasons. Multiplayer is a nightmare - no matter if you're playing locally or online. Online - oh god - that's a mess. Over and over again, people can leave your island by disconnecting or just quitting - which results in you losing anything that you've done or received. That 100k or cool recipe you just got? POOF! It's gone. Congrats. And the one island-per-switch choice is moronic. If you are a parent thinking you can get this and enjoy playing with your kids but having your own island - you're SOL.

But if you want, I can still come visit your islan- hold on a second. The game needs to pause every time someone leaves or enters your island. So if you just got some killer turnip prices or a meteor shower and want to make some money from people ****, good luck with that. It's fantastic gameplay, lemme tell you.

However, what makes this game so bad goes far, far beyond that. You get a dialog popup for. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. THAT. YOU. DO. Caught that same fish for the 100th time? Let me give you a dialog box! Want to visit another island? Here's 10 dialog boxes for you! Want to craft an item? Here's 5 dialog boxes for each item you want to craft! Did you close that dialog box? Here's another one for closing it. So much time is spent on stupid aspects of the game that are simply - dumb - design decisions.

By the way, you'll be crafting each item individually as there's no bulk crafting. Fishing is annoying as the timing of when fish change directions is almost exactly the same as the time it takes for each cast. NMT islands get boring incredibly fast. This game repeatedly feels like a free-to-play game because at multiple points, you cannot progress until a day passes.

I've played life sim games like this. At this point, I'm wholly recommending you play **** over this game. It's cheaper too, and the dev will straight up respond to your suggestions or bug reports on Twitter. The sad thing is ALL of these issues are just dumb design choices that could be fixed easily with a patch. The QA team should be fired for how bad this game feels at times."
Doooodal,"Apr 16, 2020",10,"Amazing game. Haven’t stopped playing it since I bought it. A lot people complaining about the island representative not being shared is kind of understandable, but it’s definitely not worth rating the game 1 or 0 stars. Sure “your” user doesn’t have 100% control on the island at the moment but there are ways around this. You can just ask firstly, haha, or you can log in as their user and do the things necessary. Idk I’m sure there are other ways around this. My gf just grabs an extra controller and calls my in game char in, swaps leader and plays as my char if she really wants do something. Think outside of the box people!"
thatonehomie,"Apr 16, 2020",4,"the only thing keeping me going is raymond the cat in a maid outfit pros: relaxing fun simulation. time traveling is not punishable. quirky characters. being able to build a town freely. doesn’t seem like many pros but this is the entire game and what makes it fun.

cons: terraforming takes so much time and precision, there is not two specific buttons for building and destroying. the music is the same loop over and over. no multi-crafting = making 60 individual fishbaits. cannot buy multiple pieces of shirts or shoes at able shop. RIDICULOUS airline dialogue that takes more time to travel.whenever someone arrives on the island, shows stupid “how long it’ll take for them to get here” screen that interrupts EVERYBODYS gameplay. Nintendo has become greedy and requires you to have two consoles to have different islands, and rips the joy out of local play. there isn’t even a bar to show how close your tool is to breaking- come on! if we’re going to take inspiration from BOTW then at least implement game designs that make sense. the dialogue with the villagers feels so empty. half of the **** they do makes no sense- what about a real conversation? and for GODS sake can somebody help out with building ramps and bridges? the villagers donate three pennies to a project that costs 228,000$!!"
Adsz,"Apr 16, 2020",0,"Would be a 9 or 10 for me but I literally can’t even progress in the **** my 6 year old create the island because she was excited to play, I then created a character and so did my partner. We played for a long time before realising that all the islands tasks are basically tied to the person who played the game first and any additional residents have absolutely no say in anything whatsoever, they don’t even have visibility on progress to that they can contribute materials etc. Nintendo need to patch this **** the little one decided to stop playing one day, my character that I’ve spent so long on is absolutely useless. For such a social game on a family oriented console, this is totally unacceptable. A simple option to change who the resident representative is would suffice."
Natgutierr,"Apr 16, 2020",1,"My husband and I brought this to play together, he started to play first and now I can't do a lot if he doesn't play. Now I always play on his character because mine can't do a lot. As I read in a comment, there's a dictator and a slave and it's not fun.
Love the game for one, but not good for more people."
bananajamslam,"Apr 16, 2020",5,"Game gets boring very quickly. Same as every other game, you complete chores to earn money and increase the size of your house. The crafting system is interesting in the beginning, but gets stale very quickly and can't be used for anything actually important, like infrastructure.
Additionally, the ""island"" from the last game which was a good place to make some quick money, was removed and replaced with randomly generated islands that are usually devoid of anything interesting. Ok if you're stuck in the apocalyptic COVID-19 quarantine nightmare... but there are more fun ways to spend your time. Also, I can't believe there isn't a voice chat on the switch, it's so annoying to have to type things to your friends with a ~20 character limit."

Valentine123,"Apr 16, 2020",0,"So people say this game is so nice, beautiful, etc. My game saves broke. Out of nowhere. randomly. Who cares if the is beautiful if you can't even keep your own save from breaking? I've lost so much progress. Shame on you Nintendo. Shame. This could've been fixed and prevented with the cloud saving. There is no excuse for no cloud saving. And my save breaking is a prime example of why there should be a cloud service. The emergency save recovery should've been available at launch. No excuses considering they also delayed the game for nearly a year. It's baffling to see how much Nintendo actually cares about its consumers. Shame on Nintendo. SHAME."
Zaltys,"Apr 16, 2020",5,"This series is starting to focus more and more on things that I don't enjoy.
Nook is even more of a slave driver, and the merit system makes the game feel more stressful. And this time around you need to pay for everything, including bridges and inclines. By the time I was done with those and got access to the new terraforming feature, I was completely exhausted to the point that I don't feel like playing this anymore. Having to replace broken tools every five minutes certainly doesn't help.

All of that wouldn't be so bad if the villager dialogue wasn't (against all odds) even worse than in City Folk. I've been playing for a couple of weeks, and have already heard the same lines about 'digging up fossils yesterday' nearly a hundred times. Dialog is more generic than before. For instance, the villagers say that 'you wear that a lot' about everything as opposed to the previous AC games where they'd comment about WHAT you're wearing, etc. And while you can now place furniture outdoors, these too get generic responses from the animals: 'who put a drinking fountain outside? That's so weird'.

In short, New Horizons is tedious, and I can't see myself playing it for more than a couple of weeks. Not when I could just play Wild World or New Leaf instead, either of which are much superior to this in everything but graphics."
Fonzyd,"Apr 16, 2020",1,"I made this account solely to write commentary on this game. Which means Nintendo really screwed up. I don’t write reviews. Not yelp, not amazon, not here, not anywhere. The fact that Nintendo it deliberately restricting their fan base and clientele it atrocious. ONE island per console. Are you guys out of your mind??? Good job at  showing gratitude to the people that support your company *sarcasm*. the fact that can’t even give an option to purchase access for additional islands per switch or allow more content access for a secondary player astounds me. Terrible job Nintendo. It’s a nice game, but you’ve seriously done yourself a disservice."
LazyLoad08,"Apr 16, 2020",6,"I feel like this game is either getting hailed as one of the greatest or hated on for its flawed local multiplayer aspect. As I'm the only one playing on my Switch, that does not bother me and nothing is stopping me from joining the ones praising this game greatly.
However, I feel like the game is just... good. I get that it's not designed to take hours of your time daily, but I felt on the first day that it was just extremely empty and it was quite off-putting. Then I began questioning my decision to buy the game; fortunately, there is more to do in the next days.
Some criticism comes from the ""click A-fest"" that occurs during some conversations. Some people defend it by saying it's a part of the game and it helps the immersion. Well... I would agree if the dialogue would get switched up and I wouldn't need to repeat four choices after getting an error or missclicking the last one. Unfortunately, there is no variance and no new lines. Everyone just keeps repeating their own spiel. Doing things like museum donations or flying to another islands gets super tedious and annoying rather fast. The constant interruptions in multiplayer don't add to the charm either. Read that as: the multiplayer in this game is completely atrocious and utterly useless.
Content wise the game is good and I feel there is still more for me to uncover. As I like this kind of games in general, I look forward to it - but I have to acknowledge it's definitely not for everyone."

Max12341234,"Apr 15, 2020",0,I wanted to buy this game but the fact that we cant share the same console with other users and have to buy a new switch for every user is stupid and its makes it too complicated for me to get this game. Im not rich. I wont buy another switch just for one game and i dont want my girlfriend to be player 2 and have no power in the game just because im the player 1 for example. This is very stupid. I will not buy it and its very disapointing.
unicorncastle,"Apr 15, 2020",0,Had I known that only one person could make changes and be in control of the island I would not have bought this game for my family of 4. Not only do my wife and I have to share an island my two children have to share as well. We all have to agree on where things go and what gets completed. This takes out all of the fun of being in control of your own island and designing it the way you'd like. Very unhappy about this choice.

Pepper12,"Apr 15, 2020",0,"I was so excited for this game and now I hate it, I didn't know one design decision could make me so upset with Nintendo and the animal crossing franchise. The switch was advertised as a family console with great multiplayer options, much the same the new animal crossing was also marketed with great family experience. However, seems to me that the only people who are enjoying this game are the ones who own one switch per person. I could almost get on board with sharing an island but other players outside the primary get a **** version of what should be a good game, with little to no participation in the story line and island creation. This is a ruthless and greedy scheme by Nintendo to force people to buy multiple devices (family marketed devices not solo marketed devices), makes me disgusted and I no longer want to support Nintendo."
Gayshipping_101,"Apr 15, 2020",0,"ONLY ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE I was completely mortified and heart broken I have finally saved up enough money to buy the **** game and I let my younger brother play first since he was so excited because we use to play Animal crossing New leaf. the next day I turned it on so ready to create my own island and my own clothes and GUESS **** WHAT it doesn't let me. I start asking google and I find out there's only a one island restriction per CONSOLE! My heart was **** I have been waiting for this game Since they announced it and turns out I can't even enjoy the full experience Since I can't buy another console and for that FACT another copy of the game for that console WHAT THE **** NINTENDO FIX THIS, THIS IS A CONSOLE THAT WAS MADE FOR MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS THE SWITCH IS NOT A DAMN 3DS

This is a great game and my little brother loves it but me and my other sibling including my parents feel like NPCs since the first person is considered the founder and the other players are just another character on the island. I love my little brother but me and my family members don't want to live on an island called bubblepop no not living as GUEST! we want to have our own islands SEPARATELY with different names and all progressing at different TIMES!

Force2BRknd,"Apr 15, 2020",1,"Nintendo is pulling an all out cash grab on this game. Yes the gameplay, graphics, and overall feel are **** they lock one island per switch.

The primary character is the only one who can take direction from Tom nook and further the development of the island. They cant even contribute supplies to help build things.

swavmirj,"Apr 15, 2020",5,"TL;DR: This game locks out anyone wanting to share a console with a household by removing core game functions (story progression, infrastructure tools) to players 2 to 8, and only allows for complete collection of elements if players engage in local co-op with other game owenrs or they subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online (see below for details).

4.5 out of 10 seems a fair score to give a game that put in a huge amount of effort to create a beautiful, well executed, addictive game that alienates half its player base. For each player in a household to have the full experience, you would need to spend $408AUD per person ($79 for a copy of the game, $329 for a Nintendo Switch Lite). Safe to say, no game is worth $408.

Here are some of the features that players 2 to 8 on a single game miss out on: Story elements, bundles of free recipes, and island editing tools (infrastructure projects, moving buildings/houses, terraforming).
This would be the equivalent of BotW only allowing the first person to boot the game to fight the Divine Beasts and Fight Ganon, but allowing all other players to collect hearts, stamina, and resources for player one.
Or, it would be the same as only allowing the first player to boot up Super Mario Odyssey to collect moons, while every other player could only collect coins.

Furthermore, none of the promotional materials, nor any reviews of the game have indicated that collecting all the materials within the game is capped for anyone looking for a purely single player experience. As an example, a single console and island has access to a maximum of half the fruit species available unless they engage in local co-op with another owner of the game, or subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online. Datamining revealed that players visiting Mystery Islands will only be exposed to their Native Fruit, and a ""Sister Fruit"". No matter how many Mystery Islands you visit, these will be the only two fruits you'll be exposed to.

The shady nature of the promotions around collecting, combined with the lack of autonomy given to all players beyond player one, is why this game is getting slammed by players. That is why such a beautiful game, with addictive gameplay, does not deserve the full praise it deserves, when it is so clearly trying to force people into purchasing multiple copies and consoles to fulfil the experience."
lestrangerface,"Apr 15, 2020",5,"I love most of this game. I really do. I have had so much fun. Only allowing one island per console, though, is a bunch of ****. Also, I hate how the first player gets to make all the calls and make the changes. I would be fine if after we unlocked everything, the other players could go in and request new bridges or inclines, but we can't. if my wife stopped playing, I'd have to restart the f*cking game in order to do anything to the island. How stupid is that!!? I understand that they want to sell more consoles, but they could have just sold more games. We'd by 3-4 copies of the game so that we could swap out islands."

It's been like this since day **** one but I guess now that it's the switch it's a problem. Even in New Leaf, it was like this, the first person was the mayor and the next people were just islanders, I don't understand why people are hating on this game for the same thing New Leaf did but not blaming that game. Second, the new leaf had no Co-op, no Animal crossing game up to this point had no one console Co-op, so at least it is a thing? I don't understand the point that people bring up, it's like they don't know **** and are just angry because they didn't do their research. Animal crossing is fun either way and honestly, all the stuff that you can do as the first player does not matter. Yes, I do wish that there could be more than one island but in all honesty, it does not matter to me. Yes, I know that that is not a valid argument but still, it's not as big of a deal as people make it out to be"

SirThomasCox,"Apr 15, 2020",0,"The game on its own is great but the local coop mode is awful. There are so many limitations to it which make it such a pain to play that it isn’t even fun. You can’t drop in and drop out, you need to load the whole game again if one person wants to go solo but they happened to join last. The controls for player 2 are terrible and you spend ages scrolling through your tools when that could so easily be fixed with the proper tool wheel. You can’t play on other islands with other players either which is so lame. This is not to mention the main, and worst limitation.... which is Nintendo money grubbing all over - you’ll have read about it before but you can only have one island per console and only one player (the first player to do so..) will be able to run through the story mode (I for one won’t be buying ANOTHER Switch and ANOTHER copy of the game just to have my own island). There is no reason for this and Nintendo could just as easily allow 2 islands or more per console. I would love to recommend this game but, if you’re going to play coop, I would stay away until these issues get resolved. Though knowing Nintendo that is unlikely to ever happen."
Aamtrack,"Apr 15, 2020",0,I have 18 hours into the game and can’t progress because I was not the first person on it in my household.  I can’t transfer the representative position too.  I will fix my rating once they fix this issue!  It is unreal how in this day and age this is a problem.
MICKticken,"Apr 15, 2020",7,"this game gets a lot of flack for being boring. And I 100% agree. Upon starting this game, the player realizes how much of a time sink this game is. The first literal week of playing is a dull time. If the game progressed at the early game's pace it would be a failure. that being said, once you get the ladder things pick up dramatically. Animal Crossing evolves so wonderfully into this symphony of good vibes that you can't help but smile. everything is charming. The idle pose for your villager is putting his arms on his hips, similar to how I feel every time I do something right. there are 3 big downsides if you play this game. Online Multiplayer is a slog and really uninteresting. In fact, it takes a minute for anyone to even join your island. Nintendo has never seemed to understand how online multiplayer works, this game only proves that. The 2nd downside is the slow start. The first week or so is a disappointment. Nothing seems to ever happen. you get told to do menial tasks with the goal of god knows what. the clunky tedium of every action gets on your nerve quick. the 3rd thing is no mini-games. in the first Animal Crossing, you could unlock a bunch of NES games to play. there isn't any equivalent in New Horizons. the closest thing is running away from bees/spiders. the tedium is the gameplay. If you want action and adventure, Do not buy this game, If you want a serene yet flawed experience I would recommend."
jonbravo2,"Apr 15, 2020",5,"I'm a newcomer to the Animal Crossing franchise. I wanted to get into it during New Leaf but I never forced myself to buy it. After I got my Switch and saw the new one coming out I figured I'd pick it up.

So far, the game is very relaxing to play. I appreciate the slow pace and happy cutesy design of the characters. I find myself wanting to build the perfect island for my friends, the characters I like and me. The major holdup I have is the confusion that comes with trying to do all of that.

Some of the requirements to accomplish certain goals are obscure and hidden. Making money feels like a grind. Villagers only visit my campsite so few and far between that I wonder how long it will take me to find the perfect characters for my island. I don't know how to gain new DIY recipes to keep making my island beautiful!

I won't stop playing the game for a while, but I will not be playing for hours on end like I did when I first bought it.

I'll probably just start time travelling my island into the future to get things done faster. I feel like that isn't the proper way to play, but that's the way to progress when you first start anyways."
Smonroe,"Apr 15, 2020",0,I bought this game for my mom and son to play after the first day they were fighting about everything. Only one island per console bulls*** has ruined what could have been a great game. If I would have known this I would not have wasted my money.
Micocoule,"Apr 15, 2020",0,I am the second player (my wife is first) and I can't properly play to the game if she doesn't do stuff before me. I'll change my rating when this gets fixed.
Althrayn,"Apr 15, 2020",0,"Hate to be part of review bombing but I think it's the only way to have attention brought to this.

It's one thing to limit everyone to one **** island is large enough that if people don't want to live near each other they can stay apart.  But the current system in which the island's progress is completely tied to the progress of whoever the first player on the console is is absolutely ridiculous.  There's no need for it in my eyes, I can't see any reason why it should have to be this way; I don't want to be cynical of nintendo, but it honestly feels like a move to sell more systems--simply because I can't fathom any other reason that would be necessary.

Personally speaking as a player 2 on the island, it feels like I have no point in playing.  I don't get assignments from Tom Nook, which means I don't get any recipes like my P1 does; I also don't get to invite citizens to the island, or plan infrastructure, or make any decisions.  Basically I'm playing home decorator 2020, because I can't contribute anything to the island aside from paying money towards bridges/stairs and throwing some furniture outside.

Hopefully the devs catch wind of the review bombing and seek to patch this out sooner rather than later.  Again, being on one island is fine, but having no options to contribute as player 2 is ridiculous.  Its as simple as giving P2+ the options to change infrastructure and invite settlers; and if you're worried about doubling-up missions, just have Tom Nook announce that someone else is working on an assignment for him already, and then have him lay out what the assignment is and give the recipes needed for the other players to help."
Lamzluigi,"Apr 14, 2020",3,"The limit of secondary account, really two players doest Enjoy a full gane is stupid :(("
5DExperience,"Apr 14, 2020",0,"The game would be a whole lot better if they had added the Dream Suite as well as Club Tortimer back to the game. At the moment even with quite a bit of progression it seems like they released an unfinished game with even less content than they had in New Leaf.
It's still a beautiful game, don't get me wrong. But within a month even without Time Travelling I've nearly completed the museum and have already gotten close to receiving golden tool DIY Recipes.
If Nintendo added the dream suite and club tortimer back with its public island as well as a lot of the other features they added in the previous instalment then I would be rating this way higher.
But so far it just seems like the game is a carbon copy of the previous games before New Leaf that's even been dumbed down by just giving a crafting option to make it seem as if the game is giving you "" MORE THINGS TO DO "", when in reality you're really just repeating the same stuff over and over and over again tediously. For being a Flagship IP of Nintendo, this game really let me down with the expectations I had for it and I wouldn't be surprised if this would prevent me from buying the next one or further Nintendo Consoles because of this as this game was the reason I purchased the switch."

dryricefields,"Apr 14, 2020",0,"The one island per console is a really huge issue. Nintendo just wants you to buy more consoles and copies. If they added the OPTION to share an island, this could be one of the greats on the switch, but sadly greed is a thing."
Razalas,"Apr 14, 2020",0,"Honestly, who thought it was a good idea to make one island per switch? Who sat there and said yea that's a great idea people will love that. Its not even like they tried to even make it so the other profiles on the switch can play. You can do literally close to nothing and are stuck living like a literal bum in a tent on whoever's island the main profile belongs to. Truly a garbage way to make a game Nintendo, there goes another one of your sales."
SanguineFox,"Apr 14, 2020",0,Thought I’d have a great time getting into a series I’ve been recommended by friends for years. I can’t even enjoy my own single player experience because I happened to be the second person in my house to make a character. Waste of money.
That1guy2007,"Apr 14, 2020",3,"Co-OP multiplayer is a HUGE disappointment.. pretty much a deal breaker for me and my wife. Hopefully Nintendo will fix this, but being essentially a bot for another player is horrible and seems like a very lazy design choice."

Even if I wanted to log in under my profile to play, since my wife made the island first, it is 100% LOCKED onto her playthrough. I can't do anything. $60 down the drain. DO NOT BUY."
hegemonfpe,"Apr 14, 2020",0,"Nintendo almost made the perfect cozy game, but the extreme limitations put on the second player, and requirement to purchase an entire second console if you want to have two players play on equal footing makes the game unplayable if you don't have a switch for every person in your home who wants to play."
HazelFayes,"Apr 14, 2020",7,"It's rather unfortunate to see all of the negative reviews for what should be considered such a great game. Animal Crossing New Horizons is such a fresh take on the series and offers so much more to players than previous entries. It has great online play and the visuals just feel extremely nice,  although a bit more of the gridlocked side. Villagers are all super friendly, albeit, a bit boring with their repetitive dialogue types. The small attempt of a story or some sort of plot is welcoming and very unobtrusive to the main aspects of the game. Not to mention, the Nook Miles program gives such a great incentive to keep playing the game, and just using every feature the game has to offer.

Some things noticeably offputting- which does have a load of the fanbase lowering their reviews- is these things listed:

-While you can speed through crafting animations, you can't essentially just skip the entire animation.
-You can't craft multiples of things all at once, therefore having to go through tedious crafting sessions.
-As mentioned before, dialogue with villagers still remains seriously repetitive, including main npc characters (Nook, Isabelle, etc...)
-Local multiplayer is tedious, especially doing the follow the leader with other players. It's terrible and not incredibly fun.
-The game being locked to one island per console is relying on a relic system from the past which should've been obsolete by now. Furthermore, players who aren't the leader of the island cannot progress through the story until the leader player does. For a game that advertises multi-user friendliness, this drawback really drains out that aspect.

Although these are some unfortunate drawbacks overall, the game is still super good and has lots of growth potential. Hopefully, Nintendos AC dev team will listen to the complaints users have,  and fix some of these things."
jabgreenwood,"Apr 14, 2020",3,"I would give this game a solid 8. The relaxing gameplay is good and the game is gorgeous. But on the execution side, that would be a generous 2! The game feels unfinished. I was hoping for way better gameplay quality from Nintendo. The main one being the multiplayer mode as many people said. I'm even more frustrated because this is a issue that designers couldn't not see. I tried mutiplayer with my girlfriend, but the feeling was really bad. And with the annoying animation each time you harvest as a companion makes you don't want to harvest anymore. On solo mode, if I harvest too much, My girlfriend will be mad because she has nothing to do and will be stuck. There are also other beginner issues. When you talk to sell or buy something, you are kicked out of the interraction and you have to retalk to the character again. Even Pokemon Red had this sort out! The wheel of tool control is bad. Aiming at fish is a pain in the ass. interractions are too long, even for a relaxing game. Finally, a little related to the multiplayer issue, the save fil management was the cue that told me that the game is unfinished. The issue is even address in the game with a animation!"
TeaBrack,"Apr 14, 2020",8,"Really great relaxing game. You need to be patient if you want to get it, everything happens in real time so it's kind of slow but it's still a great game"
MonkdemMan,"Apr 14, 2020",6,"I do not care about the 1 island per switch. This is a game review site and should not be a place for butt hurt fanboys to vent their incel frustrations.  Anyway I picked up the game as I never played an ac before and wanted to see what the fuss was. The game is colourful and charming and the animals are very adorable. I like how it's random with who will be moving into your island.  But I just dont get it you fish, hunt bugs look for fossils and that's kind of it. It's a slow pace chill game and I can see why some like it as an escape but it's not for me"

I have three kids and we share a Switch.  I'm not going to buy two more Switches just so everyone can have their own island.  The fact that only the first person to log into the game gets to decide everything and have the only island is absolutely infuriating.

Peachybrush,"Apr 14, 2020",0,"Extremely disappointing game. I bought this thinking it would be a great couch co-op for my girlfriend and myself to play together after seeing the initial reviews of the game. It is not a great couch co-op game, the couch co-op feels like in fact it has intentionally been made to be a bad experience. Not only is the couch co-op bad but the game is effectively only good for 1 account per switch. They have made it so whoever creates the island in the game the first time creates the only island you can make for your switch. Okay so you have to share an island, thats not bad it was for couch co-op anyways. Then after starting to play you realize that the first player is the ""resident representative"" so basically they get the full game experience. Every other play: does not get to create their own island, can not place and buildings, terraform or do anything of any importance to the island they are forced to play on, they do not get key recipes they will need to make basic furniture for their house that the first player gets, they cannot advance the story past what the first player advances the story to. Again, this game design has clearly been made to sell customers on more consoles, it feels very deliberately restrictive to all players but the first. It has intentionally made couch co-op a disappointing, shallow experience. I would not recommend you spend your money on this. Spend 15$ on startdew valley and get a game with 10x more content and functionality."

OctopusBoi747,"Apr 14, 2020",0,"This game is absolutely revolting! I can’t even believe the audacity of Nintendo for creating a “multiplayer game” that only really allows ONE PLAYER to play!!!

This should be patched immediately or at least ADVERTISED!! Don’t buy if you want to play it multiplayer or with your family."
BlueJay888,"Apr 14, 2020",0,"FAMILY UNFRIENDLY - Nintendo have decided to try and gouge families. its crazy that a game so suited to play by young kids is locked down to just one island per console. I can't justify multiple purchases for my kids, so only one of them can use NH (because she was promised it as a reward) while the others can't play. If she hadn't been promised the game, I wouldn't have bought it on priniciple - this is just user hostile. Given the colossal difference in value between X-box game pass and the cost of all the Nintendo exclusives on the switch, this will be the last but one Nintendo game I buy (if I don't by the next Zelda game, my family will kick me out)."

Strarompi,"Apr 14, 2020",2,Only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff.

I feel in love with animal crossing a little late into the game but still found that this one respects the old ones and moves forward with new mechanics.

Only downside is that there are no gyroids. Hopefully they will add them in."
sokidan,"Apr 13, 2020",6,"I have mixed opinions on this game, which I will list below:

Positive:
+ Addition of crafting and Nook Miles makes it more game-like, and have more incentive to play
+ Customization of furniture, and being able to place items outside increases creativity
+ Some Quality of life improvements, like not being stopped by store-keepers when entering and leaving
+Animals have more animations, cute.
+ Terraforming is a neat addition

Negatives
- Terraforming controls are finnicky and overly-time consuming to use
- No way to craft in batches
- Animals repeat themselves constantly
- Online is terrible with dodo codes. Load times everywhere, constant errors
- Lack of furniture sets
- Less stores, upgrades, and main characters than in past titles
- One Island per Switch
- Player 2 is a glorified NPC, unable to do anything while you are the leader
- Game repeats same song for first week, become grating fast
- Loading in-between museum rooms is grating, same with in houses

All in all, it is an entertaining time-waster, but this is NOT a 10/10 game. Cute, yes, but it has a wide array of issues and quality-of-life problems that alone knock it down points. After a few weeks of playing without fast-forwarding the clock, the game has become stale with little remaining depth to offer."
Theeverafter,"Apr 13, 2020",0,"Fiancé loves the game, but got it for both of us to play, except we have COMPLETELY different play styles and ways we like to be creative, she has played it since it came out, i get on and i can only play on her island? Why?
I cant contribute to her full museum or make major changes to how the island is laid out because she made her game first? Whats the point in even playing this game if you dont play alone? What does nintendo expect me to do? Buy another switch and another copy of this game? Its crap. And essentialy just makes this game **** this nintendo its not hard"
Zykster0,"Apr 13, 2020",10,"First off yes not having your own island is kinda annoying, but it's always been that way every game prior and nobody complained about it. people who give zeros obviously haven't played the game, because this is probably the best  game on switch apart from Zelda. Yes the game is slow but it is nowhere near boring, you always have an objective to do like paying off your mortgage, inviting new neighbors, etc. This game is mean't to be play like when walk through a park or go on a hike, it's not explosive excitement but it is really relaxing and satisfying. upgrading your house and finishing a section in the museum is incredibly rewarding. In fact have one island per switch is the best part, I have 3 other people on the same island and it is nowhere near crowded. having 3 of my siblings makes it feel more like home, being able to trade and help the rest of my family makes the game even more personal. it even got my mom interested interested in video games and overall has helped my family grow closer. In the end, unless you hate your family or roommates having one island won't affect you and maybe it will help you to appreciate others more."
samuisamu,"Apr 13, 2020",0,The first person to play is the resident representative and is the only player that really matters.

Cojax,"Apr 13, 2020",3,"The game is very lacking in content. Once you get the kk slider concert that is effectively the end of the game as far as building goes. There is nothing left to do but collect stuff. There is a huge amount of content loss between this and new leaf, with the addition of Terra forming and crafting, and the crafting system just feels like busy work so that you take a few weeks to realize how much else is missing compared to previous entries. Nintendo released an unfinished game, if they try to sell back the missing content it is scummy."

Drull7737,"Apr 13, 2020",1,"The game is fun, the gameplay is addicting, this low score is based on the fact that if you try to play with multiple profiles, you will only have one island. This means that one person might start the island and have it be theirs and someone else would just be a resident, unable to play the game the way it was meant to be. Resources are limited, leading to whoever plays first every day getting everything and the second being left with nothing. Even buying a separate game cartridge won’t solve the problem. It’s a cheap way to sell switches, and proves Nintendo is losing its dedication to customers and families. 1 Star"
StaveIsle,"Apr 13, 2020",0,It is not a multiplayer game. it is a single-player game where others can visit and support your Island. That's it. No method to change Residents or share Residency.

AlwynOwen,"Apr 13, 2020",3,"This game is great! If you have your own switch that is. Me and my brother bought a copy of the game excited to start our own islands, but little did we know after him starting the island we had to share it. Since he's the mayor he's always one step ahead of me in everything and has more privileges than I do. Alot of people tell me ""it's tradition in the franchise"" but I think it's time for a change. I can afford a second copy but I'd still have to share the island and quite frankly that's an EA move. As a resident I give it a 3 but if I had my own island I'd give it a 10.

Leiros,"Apr 13, 2020",9,"I'm really enjoying this game. I'm the only person that plays on my console, so the problems others have complained about don't exist for me. It's been over 15 years since I've played an Animal Crossing game and this one doesn't disappoint. As long as you don't have to share your Switch with someone else, this is a very fun game and I highly recommend it."
TherealG,"Apr 13, 2020",0,"I want my own Island is that to much to ask for $79. Not happy, really disappointed that they did this to us, I was really looking forward to playing this with my family. Having to share an island between all of us has just made us all frustrated."
gslopez,"Apr 12, 2020",2,"The truth is that if I would want to play this game alone, my rate will be a lot better. I´m playing with my girlfriend, she is ""the main citizen"", and I can't help with anything! I don't have the main DIY recipes, I can't help in the main decisions and my experience is pretty limited. I don't have problems with the one island limitation but it feels like the co-op game experience is incomplete.
And finally, why is it necessary to change the switch tools button when you are the second player? and why can't I pick items and store them in my inventory? That makes no sense to me.
Please Nintendo, fix the co-op experience !!!!"

hassickboy,"Apr 12, 2020",0,one island? returning now. not buying a second switch just so my wife can also play the $60 game we paid for.
OneMariachi,"Apr 12, 2020",6,"There's a lot of negative reviews complaining about the lack of ability to create your own unique island. Now whilst this is an incredibly valid issue with this game. I realise it may not apply to a large subset of players. On the other side there is a lot of very high marks from people that don't care about that.

I felt I wanted to give a more full summary and review of this game, to give those that probably sit in the middle of not being a long time fan, and having played this game for the first time, like me. I've put in roughly 50 hours into this game. With only 2 days of time travel done at the beginning to speed up the nothing you can do in the first 2-3 days of owning this game.

Effectively, the good parts. Nintendo, as always are very good at creating charming worlds. Filled with lovely character, and look really nice. The graphics are wonderful to behold. One fo the best aspects of this game in my particular view is the designing as pects. There is a lot of items and a lot of ways they can be utilised to make unique little biomes for yourself to enjoy and feel creative. I had a lot of fun organising my house.

Beyond that though. There really is not a whole lot to do. Once you've built the shop/museum and got a few rooms of your house. This game gets insanely repetitive. The game becomes, pick fruit. fish a little, dig your 4 fossills(which, you run out of unique ones super quick). Hit some rocks, and buy some of the new clothes. Slowly making money to add a new room to your house. It's rinse and repeat of that, for about an hour every day as once you've completed that routine, there is nothing else to do.

The big thing is that i was doing all of that, to get the terraforming. I spent an hour a day doing this repetitive nonsense so I could terraform and really make the island my own. when I finally got terraforming. I finally had to go, yep that's enough for me.

See here is the big major issue with this game. The repetitive stuff, lots of people can look past. they find it relaxing and stress free, a nice mindless task to focus on and remove the pressures of life from. Me, I don't really get it, I like being creative, so that's why I stuck to it. The thing is though, that Nintendo seem to be stuck in the early 90's when it comes to game mechanics. There are so many barriers in the way of you trying to enjoy this game to the best of its ability. The constant repetition of dialogue, the inability to organise your inventory properly, the inability to build more than one item at a time, or buy more than one item at a time- which is annoying in the Nook atm machine- but ten thousand times worse when at the Abel sisters house and you have to keep walking in and out of the dressing room if you want more than 1 shirt at a time. The seemingly no reason for why trees wont grow. The multiplayer is gimped hard too, Nintendo and internet simply do not work. You want a friend to come over. Cool, go to the airport and open your gates, hidden behind 10 mintues worth of dialogue. Jesus Christ Nintendo, allow me to have my gates open at all times, or at least allow my friends to request to come over through the use of the Nook phone. A quick invite and join system through the phone. But no, it's a whole infuriating process- even after they've visited the first time and become a ""best friend"". Either Nintendo are incredibly incompetent at game QOL, or they know how to fix these things and don't in order to artificially increase game time, because they know how little actual game-play there is in this game.

Terraforming, is without a doubt one of the most poorly implemented mechanics I've seen Nintendo create, and I genuinely don't know if this game was actually tested properly. Because it is a joke. There is no marker for where you are creating, and it will constantly, and randomly, without any logic choose a different square to work on, regardless of if you do the same action. On top of that, you will either fill land in, or remove land, with the exact same button- use the rest of the buttons Nintendo. One for filling one for removing land. How insanely hard is that to think of. Forcing you to work several times on the same squares because of the lack of any guidance and logic to the system. This game reeks if eitehr laziness or incompetence. I don't know which, and I don't much care. But this game is not even close to being perfect, and has a lot of work needing to be done on it to make it beyond a 6/10.

TLDR; Had some fun with creating, but there are way too many terrible UI/Game mechanics, and repetitive annoying dialogue to allow me to think it is a good game."

sludacris,"Apr 12, 2020",9,"This game is delightful.

I'm writing this review to counteract the people giving it a ZERO because they don't like the one-island setup.  Yeah, you don't like it, I get it.  People are getting hundreds of hours of entertainment from a $60 game.  There is literally nothing else in life that gives that much money-to-entertainment ratio.  Even the cost of another Switch factored in (plus all the other games you'd play on it and be entertained by), it is still a great deal.  The single island thing is definitely a cash grab move, but is still better than most companies doing the micro-transaction thing.  The hours of entertainment involved with modern systems/games far outweigh the cost involved (when compared to other types of entertainment, such as movie theaters or dinner or theme parks, etc etc).

Actual criticism about the game itself:

I don't like that when you BUY stuff you get a chance to buy something else without restarting the conversation, but when you SELL stuff, you can sell that one thing and then have to start the conversation over.  Only a minor annoyance, though.

I wish that in the out-of-doors, you could get an idea of where you're about to set an item down (and how big of a space it needs).  You spend a lot of time guessing and then getting an alert that there isn't space there.  In time, you get a better idea.  Again, just a minor annoyance."
AndyHardware,"Apr 12, 2020",0,The island being linked to the console is ridiculous.  I'd be willing to buy a second cartridge for a new island.  You aren't squeezing another console out of me Nintendo.  You need to fix this.  It does **** because this would be an awesome game if all four of the people in my house that want to play can have their own island!

Great game if you have one switch account but terrible with other accounts."
Ditobi,"Apr 12, 2020",10,"STOP REVIEW BOMBING with fake WORDS 4SSH0L3S

Vengo siguiendo esta saga desde el Wild World y luego descubrí sobre los anteriores, incluso el de 64 para japón.

Esta edición para Switch es simplemente magistral. Han logrado cosas que realmente creo que eran muy necesarias, como el de colocar objetos tanto dentro como fuera de la casa.

Hasta ahora, la profundidad de los animales ha sido muy satisfactorio. Recuerden que el juego básicamente es como un simulador de vida y los animales deben sentirse únicos y no como bots a como pasó con New leaf, que se les sacrificó por temas de poder mejorar otros aspectos como el de los proyectos municipales.

No comprendo la queja de la gente con el tema de la isla.
Influencers de youtube, por no decir POSSERS que jamás tocaron un AC en su vida, dijieron que querían más gente para el online en la isla... le dan hasta 8 y ahora se quejan del online. ¿De verdad? Era obvio que iba a pasar eso, basta que alguien tenga mala conexión para que se arruine la experiencia, así que nintendo, que mucha gente pida algo no implica que siempre sea lo correcto.
Era muy obvio que eso iba a ocurrir.

Ahora con lo de la isla... ¿Amigo, alguna vez jugaste un AC anterior??? De cuando que en una consola puede hacer que exista un terreno o isla para cada usuario o aldeano? JAMÁS.
Obviamente el encargado de la isla (el primero) tendrá los privilegios a como el alcalde del ACNL.
¿Por qué la sorpresa? La respuesta es clara. JAMÁS JUGARON ALGÚN AC y sólo lo hicieron porque para hacer videos para youtube o por la moda, por no decir POSSERS que no saben nada de la franquicia.

Ahora ojalá nintendo pueda habilitar en un futuro parche el que el alcalde o encargado pueda otorgar permisos mientras se juegan entre varios.

Lo que no me gustó es que ya no hay música entre horas. Era algo mágico dependiendo de la hora y el tiempo (clima) y ahora al parecer es siempre la misma, salvo lo cambias con canela??
Eso me dolió, deberían de haberlo dejado como siempre y al menos dar la opción de que suene una canción siempre cuando se quiera en algunos casos.

Son cosas que a futuro pueden ser mejoradas con parches y actualizaciones, así que no tengo miedo en que nintendo haga esas cosas a futuro.

Es muy bonito juego y los fans reales del AC estamos contentísimos.
Me llegará hate por parte de algunos, pero la verdad duele dicen, sorry si les he ofendido.

Si eres nuevo en esta franquicia, tendrás la suerte de jugar al más completo de todos los AC que te prometerá horas infinitas de diversión y customización. No dudes en comprarlo porque una vez que empiezas, ya es muy dificil parar.

La creatividad e imaginación es tu único límite en este juego."

Interruptor,"Apr 12, 2020",1,"I've decided to give it a really low score as I've paid full price for this overhyped mobile game and we've pretty much stopped playing it in the house. Even my 6 year old who is the main player (I also didn't even imagine a developer would do something like this so I let her have a go first) has stopped playing after spending days collecting eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs and eggs.

1) Only one island per console
2) The first player is the only one, yada, yada, you know where this goes...
3) The island is tiny! There is hardly anything to see or do! It's so full I'll looks like a Wii menu or lobby for a larger game. This is no BOTW I'm telling you!
4) The camera is something out of the 90s! You can't see what your doing if you're behind an object. It's infuriating!
5) Tasks are boring and repetitive. Find wood. Sell. Catch shells. Sell. Pay mortgage. Repeat. Jesus it's dull! Oh wait! A new fish species for the museum!... Oh, it's not, it's an…
6) EGG! Eggs! Eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs lovely eggs, lovely eggs! Eggs eggs eggs eggs.

The game is an absolute ripoff. Go buy 3 or 4 indie titles for the money instead."

She puts buildings in random locations while I like more organized things and it’s not fair that we spent 100s on a switch and 60 on the game and I can’t even experience it fully.

BoyCharles,"Apr 12, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautiful game. Players are swept off to a blissful, peaceful island where they are free to explore, expand, and evolve the land. Characters in the game feel like they're right by your side, assisting you as the island grows and flourishes. From the moment you step off the plane and begin your Nook Inc. Getaway Package, the stunning art style, music, sound design and environments craft a game you'll never want to put down. As the game advances with the real-world clock, every day brings an abundance of new things to experience. It gives players something to look forward to, and the villagers of your island really start to feel like friends. Experience diverse seasons that bring a variety of fish, bugs and fossils to collect and fill a breathtaking museum with. Furnish and customize your home exactly the way you want. Shape the island into your own ""happy place."" The feeling of joy and childlike wonder this game evokes makes this game a must-have. However, the flaws with this game shouldn't be overlooked. Every Switch is interconnected to an island, meaning there can be only one island per system. While in theory this allows for people to join together in creating an amazing shared island, giving only the first player the power to really advance is a huge misstep. It makes the other players feel more like visitors that equal players. That being said, everyone is still able to create their own stories, homes, and connection to the game. it's not enough to darken the overall experience. All in all, this is the brightest and most innovative the Animal Crossing series has ever been. This is a game that thrives on moments, big and small. It manages to make the time-consuming and monumental parts of the game feel earned and worth the effort. At the same time, the lovely presentation and addictive gameplay allow the little moments to feel just as meaningful. It's a game that'll turn any grey day into a sunny one. Take a deep breath, get comfy, and let Animal Crossing: New Horizons blow you away."
LunariaNox,"Apr 11, 2020",8,I really love this game but the one thing that really bums me out is that I will never be able to play most of the time based events such as the fishing tourney due to work. I wish these events were 24 hours or have them split in the day like a morning tourney and a night tourney so that people who work can enjoy this part of the game. All day today my co workers and I who own ACNH lamented that we worked 9-6 and would miss out on the first fishing tourney of the year and then to find out this event only happens 4 times a year on Saturdays so we will never have this experience is upsetting.

Luvlymonster,"Apr 11, 2020",0,"I've been a fan of the Animal Crossing series for a long time; I had the gamecube when I was little and I still carry my 3DS in my bag. I wanted an app long before an AC app even went into consideration and as soon as the switch came out I waited. And waited. And here it finally is!!! Beautiful graphics, wonderful old characters, amazing new mechanics, a perfect game, as expected. If you live alone... Some people are saying that Nintendo did this out of greed but I wonder if it wasn't to try and force a style of gameplay on us they want us to use. If so, it's childish and controlling and petty. If not, then yeah, it's greedy. People aren't happy with this not because we can't get along and learn to coexist, but because exploring individual freedoms are what creativity, and therefore this game, are all about. I let my boyfriend play instead. I've already had many great experiences and I wanted this one to be for him, but after 275 dollars for the switch and then 60 for the game, I shouldn't HAVE to sacrifice like that. Nintendo has a pretty solid track record of having great ideas and then ruining them. And you'd think that because of the switch shortage from the virus that this would be as good a time as ever for Nintendo to let it go and let us have our own islands since no one can really find or afford another 300 dollar console to play on. Not that they should have to. I'm surprised people haven't resorted to stealing them out of spite. Even if Nintendo had the dignity and wisdom to fix this mistake, the game is still ruined for me. That first time experience of opening up the game and discovering all it has to offer was smeared the first time I logged in as player two. I'll never have that back. I feel resentful and angry and disappointed. I keep seeing other people play their games on my social media feed and it's frustrating. I'm missing out on the sakura trees, I'm missing out on the festivals and the seasons and my birthday is in early May. I had at least hoped this game would allievate the stress of being an essential worker on my birthday but I guess not."
Jellyfish15,"Apr 11, 2020",0,"Don’t waste your money if you share your switch with anyone. The game has a terrible multiplayer design. There is only one island allowed per switch, with all the players who did not originally start the island not having nearly as much power as the one who started the island. All other players have no ability to move forward in the story and must wait for the main player to do so. The only way to get around this problem is to buy a new switch and a new copy of the game. This is something Nintendo set up just to scam people out of way more money than the game is actually worth. Greedy pigs. I mean $80 for a game that only one person can play and that somewhat resembles a game I could buy on my phone for a couple bucks. Don’t waste your money on this scam."
justintime42,"Apr 11, 2020",10,"I think 1 island 1 Switch is amazing game design. Something I heard from a Japanese friend (seems true but need to double check) is that one of the creators would always get home from work late. Probably because of Japan’s insane working hours. Anyways, their kids would be asleep, and they wish they could game with them. So they thought, what if there was a game where they could game together, even if not at the same time? And I think that is the inspiration for the shared island game design. Even when one isn’t playing, you can see traces of their play session or they can leave nice messages, etc.

The game is literally called “Animal Forest: Come Together” in Japanese. It’s about working and building an island together. Isolating each Switch user on a desert island goes against that principle, of course that isn’t a feature. People that accuse Nintendo of making a cash grab are missing the point entirely. They are the type that like to characterize companies as big, money grabbing entities. Without thinking maybe, just maybe, these talented developers might have made those design decisions for other reasons. It seems to me many western gamers feel entitled and want every feature exactly how they want it.

People be so angry and review bombing left and right. A single design feature they don’t like doesn’t warrant rating this gem a 0. Did you not read about 1 island 1 Switch before buying the game?

Anyways, amazing game. Fun, beautiful, polished, engaging 10/10. Switch must play."
ian1234567,"Apr 11, 2020",1,"Oh fun game where only one person can do any of the basic things for the game. I can't just make my own save file?

It's the first video game she's enjoyed but now I can't even really play with her, without buying a second switch and second copy for her."
crazyeyecarl,"Apr 11, 2020",2,"It's a glorified mobile game with the WORST ""base building"" gameplay I've ever seen. The point is you're supposed to be able to build your island how you want, yet it's ridiculously restrictive. A key feature is to alter terrain. When does that unlock? After the ""story"" is done, well after it would have been relevant to have.

Then we get into the play, and wait aspects of the game. Most just turn the clocks on their system forward since it's all real time. All that proves is a severe lack of content.

It's one of those things where I laugh because people are complaining about only being able to have 1 island. You can only have 1 island, because it's a mobile game. It wasn't made to be good. It was made to make money. So if you want to know who is ruining video games. It's the fans. They don't care if it's bad, they just want more. ""It's Nintendo!"" Yeah, It's Nintendo who is taking advantage of your wallet."
AllUltima,"Apr 11, 2020",0,"My girlfriend started before me on my switch so now I basically can't play it.

The limitations put on all other players are unreasonable; don't expect to have ANY fun as any player but the main player. The second player to join an island cannot so much as craft a flimsy axe or craft a watering can. You pretty much can't play if you aren't the player that created the island. 1 island per switch is the most insane limitation nintendo has ever published."
TheLittleMelo,"Apr 11, 2020",10,"La mejor entrega de la saga por descontado. Es el más divertido, el que tiene una progresión y avance más medido y dosificado y el que ofrece mayores posibilidades de personalización.
Peca de algunos errores como una IA mejorable, o ciertas incomodidades de gestión (diálogos infinitos para todo y la no posibilidad de fabricar más de un objeto a la vez del mismo tipo).

Un juego lleno de detalles, y visualmente precioso, con entidad propia. El mejor juego para pasar la cuarentena (lleno 130 horas jugadas y lo que me queda!).

Para colmo sus posibilidades pueden aumentar con actualizaciones gratuitas periódicas siguiendo el mismo patrón que Splatoon.

Lo mejor del año."

Metabert1212,"Apr 11, 2020",1,"I’m not happy with the implementation of multiplayer in this game. I bought the game for my wife and she was excited to have her own island to explore. Come to find out, when my boys created their characters they could only go to my wife’s island. So there can only be one island per Nintendo switch, regardless of who is logged into the game under their own profile. So unless I buy multiple switches and multiple copies of the game we can’t experience our own island..... what the actual heck is that? That has got to be the laziest game development I’ve ever seen. How did the developers think it would be ok to force one island per switch???!?! This game is a huge disappointment. They really should patch the game and fix the abysmal multiplayer. I never would have downloaded the game if I had known the ridiculous decision they made. I have never played a game that had this glaring of an issue, meanwhile critics are rating it very high. Look at the user score... critics are completely out of touch with what people want in a game. Developers should pay attention."

Bought the game as a lockdown treat for myself and my kids after we all fell in love with the idea of an island life.

But that's not an option for two of us as only the first player gets to create an island.  I can't understand the design choice that results in this, other than Nintendo being desperate to sell more consoles.  This kind of thing happened on cartridge based games and was understandable to a degree but a console with plenty of storage and user accounts should not suffer with this kind of limitation.

DukeJon,"Apr 11, 2020",6,"The other user reviews are correct; the insane design decision of having one island per switch has effectively killed multiplayer for this game. You simply feel like a guest on someone else's island, and if the player who registered the island stops playing all gameplay progression comes grinding to a halt, potentially causing you to lose many hours of work. In addition to that I found single player rather pointless and cumbersome. Selecting tools, crafting, managing your inventory are all much more of a chore than they should be. The NPC's are all very boring, just wandering around all day and coming out with the same stock answers. Crafting your own furniture and items is pointless if you can't actually interact with them. What's the point of crafting a musical instrument if you can't use it? Why bother with a mirror if you can't see your reflection? Instead you just spend your time gathering resources. It's not that I dislike games of this genre, per se, but with Animal crossing you start off on such a tiny island with so little to do that's interesting I am really struggling to see why there are so many glowing reviews. **** Valley is a hundred times better than this meagre offering and that's an indie game developed by one person."

Starslight,"Apr 10, 2020",0,"As many people have mentioned, this game might be fine for a one-person household but for any more it’s awful. Second or later players can’t do hardly anything and everyone is stuck on the same small island. Only the primary player gets any significant control; everyone else gets a highly inferior experience. You can have only one player per Switch, which is ridiculous. No matter how much fun this looks, it is in NO WAY a $360 game, which is what buying the Switch and game will cost you. Don’t buy this game! Spend it on something else, perhaps with actual decent value."
Ihaveaname,"Apr 10, 2020",0,"Dear Nintendo ( and anyone who reads this),
Ive been a fan of nintendos consoles and games my whole life. I had pretty much every console that came out after i was born and I loved them.
One of my most loved games was animal crossing. I played every game in the series and even as an adult i played new leaf even till this day. Of cause i bought new horizons as soon as it got out and played it.
Sadly new horizons is why i actually write to you guys for the first time.
The game looks good and the crafting is fun but the game feels empty, unfinished and lacking. It feels like the bare bone basics of any animal crossing before it and thats it. The multiplayer is seriously lacking and that is for an console that has heavily been marketed as something to play together just unacceptable. Local multiplayer is pretty much just running behind someone and waiting for them to do something . The most i can do with the ones quarantined with me is collecting wood while one hits the trees and the other one picks it up and the worst thing is it doesn’t even go to that persons inventory but to that dumb chest. It doesn’t feel like you did or archived anything as the second player. You cant progress and since the game is so empty and the only thing to do is progress means the game is pretty much worthless if you are the second player.

The online multiplayer is better but still boring after a few times there isn’t much to do with the person so it’s mostly just repeating everything you have done that morning on your island on another. I cant imagine why you would go back a step from new leaf there you knew already that there needed to be more for multiplayer and tried to add something.

But the worst for me is that as far as i can see ive already ,,finished,, the game. My main motivations to play regularly in previous games were to build out my house completely, to build out the stores and get all the stores and then at last to make my town look pretty. Those where the long time goals, the big goals that stood over the smaller ones.

Ive already almost completely build out my house because there is nothing else to do in this game than grind for money.
In comparison it took me years to get to this stage in previous installments because there was so much more to do.
As far as i can see ive already hit the top on the nook shop. There doesn’t seem to be another upgrade as far as the Internet can tell me.
And the only thing thats left is making my town pretty and im already almost perfectly happy with everything on that front.

When i started this game it felt abit boring at first because there wasn’t much to do right at the beginning it was slow. Something that already put off one of my friends that bought the game.  Then after it picked up a bit i was so glad because i thought this was going to become great. But now after such short time i already have done what i can do and the daily chores have become kinda meaningless.

Even if in updates you guys add stuff that had already been in previous  games what motivation do i have to not play around with it for alittle bit and then put it down again? My town is already build all around the limited buildings that are in the game now. Getting rid of everything and terraforming it again will be a chore and will probably make any much needed content thats added less enjoyable.
And when you guys now slowly add the stuff that should have been in it from the beginning will you even bother to put in something new?

It makes me so sad and angry to leave such a bad review on the game. Because i love the game, i love the characters and im sure the people who worked on it put their heart into it. The items look gorgeous the characters and environments too. But the game is empty and it feels like there wasn’t enough time so it got sold unfinished in the hopes that nobody would play through the first part before it could get fixed up into an actual game.
And it pains me so much to say this but i dont know if its worth the money it costs.
I wont be telling my friends to buy it. Maybe ill tell them to wait until it actually gets made into a full game. I hear all the time that it will probably get updates that will ad in more. But for me putting out a game that feels unfinished is unacceptable. Updates shouldnt be there to make it a complete game but to add extra stuff to expand the lifetime ****.
Im more than disappointed im heartbroken.

I hope this gets to the ones who can actually change anything about animal crossing/ the strategy that is currently used on this game."

Far1and,"Apr 10, 2020",1,"Extremely disappointed by the multi-player experience.
As a young adult, I played the Gamecube Animal Crossing with my family.  We all had a great time.  It's been so long that I can't remember all the game mechanics, but it seemed to me that everyone contributed and had a great time playing the game.  My dad, the 3rd person to start playing, earned the gold statue.
Fast forward to 2020 - now I'm a dad and I was on the fence about buying a Switch since I've collected quite a few consoles over the years.  I was interested in some of the Nintendo exclusive titles, but when I saw there was going to be an Animal Crossing game on the Switch, I was sold.  Bought the Switch and pre-ordered AC:NH.  Even purchased a Nintendo online subscription to play with remote friends.
I kept thinking of how much fun I had playing the Gamecube version, and imagined doing the same with my young daughters and wife.  I really talked it up with them, the fond memories of building a home, seeing K.K. play at the train station.. how we all got statues towards the end of the game.. how much fun it was to play - playing together.
Game arrived, and since my older daughter had been good, let her fire it up and make her villager first (a mistake).
Things seemed fine, but then.. after a few days I couldn't figure out how to make a shovel.  Or an axe..  seemed odd.  I had paid off my tent loan, had Nook miles+.. bought DIY recipes for a shovel.. axe.. but those required a flimsy axe or flimsy shovel to craft.  I was quite confused.  After Googling.. I was in complete disbelief over what Nintendo had sold me.
I fully expected us to share 1 island.  That's how it was on the Gamecube (although you could probably make multiple saves on multiple cards).  I think I would have been disappointed had it NOT been 1 island.  That's sort of the point, playing together, a community.. common good and all that.  Seeing your co-players houses, what they've planted, what's new at the museum etc.
AC:NH is a huge disappointment to me.  It's been stated a million times, but only the 1st player - the resident representative - gets a real game.  Everyone else is extremely limited in what they can do.
So much a disappointment, I may just track down a copy of the Gamecube game and hope it holds up."
Jornass,"Apr 10, 2020",0,Only 1 players can play the game. others can just follow. so if more people play the game you need more nintendos... 55 euro for a gamne only 1 player can play is a ripoff.
Prrgangsta,"Apr 10, 2020",6,"So this was my first introduction into animal crossing and I gotta say that I'm not all that impressed with the game. It is a very repetitive life sim game that loses interest after so many days of playing. Everyday I do the same thing. Wake up, find my daily bell tree, plant another bell tree, check turnip prices (which always **** for me), check the hot item, and then scavenge for the resources and fossils (or anything donatable to the museum) on my island. That's what I do everyday and it is kind of driving me crazy.

The villagers don't feel like they have a purpose to be there but to be there. There are plenty of games that do the life sim thing better and add a bit more content than this series.

It's not an awful game but it doesn't grab me like other games. Also it is kind of messed up Nintendo made it 1 island per switch instead of per profile. It's 2020 guys, there should be no excuse for such a thing."
Littlesqua37,"Apr 10, 2020",0,"My wife and I purchased this game. I started an island, next thing I knew my wife started an island. Low and behold she joined my island. Stupid design. I have played about 2 hours while my wife has played about 20 hours and can’t progress without me going on and unlocking stuff because we share an island. Equivalent of a $10 game. Not worth $60. Not worth buying for multiplayer. Not worth a good review because the design of the game is so poorly done!"

I never have to deal with this level of crap with other consoles. It **** cause I really loved nintendo franchises. But they can't keep on doing this."
JazziCat,"Apr 10, 2020",1,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT FOR LOCAL MULTIPLAYER (meaning more than one use in the same household).

I cannot stress this enough as it will cause you no end of frustration, headaches, angry crying and resentment.  I say this for the simple fact that there is no true multiplayer function that will satisfy everything within the game.  The only person that has any say or control or can actually do anything worthwhile is the VERY FIRST person to start playing the game on the console. Everyone else is literally just a slave to their whims.  i can't even sugar coat it because it's caused no end of anger and frustration for my partner and I when we've tried to play together.  They lost all interest as they literally couldn't progress the story, gain DIY recipes from Tom Nook, nor actually make any meaningful decisions within the Island (such as placing residents or setting up bridges or really doing anything of note at all).  They have stopped playing entirely and that has killed my joy as i'll never be able to play with them all due to Nintendo's greed.  For a company that stresses being the best multiplayer and family friendly console on the market they sure did a good job of tearing families apart with this title.  Like they've got great multiplayer function in almost every other game, yet decided to go money hungry with this entry for whatever reason.  Locking each switch to 1 Island (even if you have multiple ID's with multiple online ability, and even with multiple game codes purchased) is just terrible restrictive and straight up greedy (and i say this as they have yet to offer a valid reason for restricting it in this way so i can only make my own inferences)

Understand that I'm not really upset at locking the switch to 1 Island per switch, that actually makes some sense to me.  The reason for the review being this low is the fact that they Advertise this game as a family friendly game, which it is clearly not, What is fun about being relegated to a servant of the first person to start the game?  If they simply added a function to change the Resident Representative in-game then none of us would have reviewed this with such vehemence.

Think about this:  If this game was purchased for a household with multiple kids or in a house with multiple roommates that all love the AC series and looked forward to playing this, if for whatever reason the 'main' person who started playing (not even the one who actually bought it because they don't restrict it to actual accounts) was not able to play for an extended period of time, either due to illness, or they were stuck in quarantine at a different location, or they simply stopped playing, then you have effectively killed all progress and joy for the remaining members of that household.  NO ONE will be able to move the game forward so long as that player never plays again.  That is why we are all distraught over Nintendo's decision, and have every right to rate this game as such.  Nintendo never shed any light on this, because had a parent of children, or partner in a relationship known that the others they live with will NEVER have the same ability or privileges across the board then they wouldn't have purchased it in the first place.  Why cause strife intentionally when we're already dealing with everything else going on in the world?

So i write this review, not to review bomb, but as a warning for all future purchasers to beware of what they'll be getting themselves into.

Now that i've said that, to validate my review i will state that until we discovered this terrible game design decision, it was a really fun and enjoyable game to play, but i will not rate it higher than a 1 until Nintendo even acknowledges this issue let alone be proactive and fix it.  (A 1 because there was enjoyment at one point, but now no longer)."
Ericmendo1,"Apr 10, 2020",9,It’s a brilliant and great game that builds and expands on the amazing success it has had in prior iterations! Yes there are a few mechanical functions that can be fixed to make gameplay more fluent but that aside this game is BRILLIANT!

My boyfriend was the one to play first, and when it was my turn that's when I found out you can only have one island per console. Even worse, the secondary player can't even access all of the features in the game which makes the gameplay dependent on the primary player to progress.

Hav0k,"Apr 10, 2020",4,"Most people have already noted that Nintendo botched the initial setup for this game. You can only create one island per CONSOLE. That seems insane, but that's been known for some time.

I still would've reviewed the game a bit better than most, but after playing through their first ""event"", it's clear Nintendo has no idea what they're doing. They launch and promote the Cherry Blossom event and talk about obtaining recipes, encouraging you to catch petals to create cool cherry blossom related items - then they make the recipes nearly IMPOSSIBLE to obtain. You could farm balloons hoping for recipes for HOURS and come away with one or two. How is this fun or interesting? What an awful, awful event.

The cutesy graphics and adorable sound effects and music basically mask a completely broken game mechanic leading to wasted time and disappointment."
Lobo_Nocturno,"Apr 10, 2020",10,"No había jugado un título de Animal Crossing antes y quería darla la oportunidad a este por el hype.

PCyrus,"Apr 10, 2020",6,"Have owned this game a few days now and the single player is fun, though a little slow to ramp up. I don't mind the progression, though; as a parent I only have limited time to play it anyway. My main gripe is the same as everyone else reviewing this game poorly - the decision to lock each Switch to one island. Previous games may have done this, but save files were treated differently when they were stored on cartridges; this was a design choice.

When I played the original game, I remember another family member and I were both able to play and have fun. Reading about the functionality for multiple players now, though, I don't feel like it's even worth inviting someone else to play. It seems like a lot of features, even beyond being able to place buildings and such (which it makes sense to restrict to one person), are missing for succeeding players.

So if you're alone, this is a great game. If you want something for multiple people to play, it's disappointing."

I don't even bother playing as the secondary character as the experience is so lacking, and seeing what my partner is achieving just adds emphasises this.

DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE CHILDREN AND ONLY ONE SWITCH. it has been designed to cause conflict. it is the opposite of what you want when your trapped in a house under quarantine and everyone is already getting on each others nerves.

Nippi,"Apr 9, 2020",0,"Low rating this game I am actually thoroughly enjoying because once again, Nintendo is becoming increasingly greedy. I was upset when they flushed free Online play down the toilet even though they clearly can afford to leave it free. Now I'm hearing how Nintendo is ripping off its consumers with the new Animal Crossing game by basically eliminating any multiplayer functionality and essential forcing households with more than one player to buy a second Switch to enjoy all of the features of the game. I have fond memories 12 years ago of me, my sister, and even my mom (who pretty much never plays video games) playing the previous console based game, City Folk. I grieve for kids who are the age I was at this time who will not have those same memories of their entire family enjoying the game. Nintendo is becoming increasingly less family friendly and more greedy. Shame, Nintendo. Absolute shame. One of these days, Nintendo's greed will cost it it's fanbase: and that will be an unfortunate day if they do not improve their relationship with their consumers. This is completely unacceptable."

Definitely buy this game - ONLY if you live alone or are fortunate to have multiple switches ($260 to $360) per person that wishes to play this game. This was ok when the games used to cost $30, but not in 2020, not for $60. This was ok for the DS when the cartridge couldn't handle the storage for multiple saves, but not for a 6+ GB game.

Unfortunately there are no separate save files, so he has to play on an island that I control, where I have already picked over all of the resources. Any subsequent players get no money, no resources and no control. This is not a family friendly game."
AnimalSuck,"Apr 9, 2020",0,My girlfriend and I was looking forward to have our own Islands and help eachother out.... 1 Island per switch is absolute **** luckily I told a lot of people about this and they passed om the game. **** off Nintendo.
Brufuss,"Apr 9, 2020",1,"I thought I would like this game as I am a very big fan of **** Valley which has a lot of similar elements to Animal Crossing. The problem I ran into over and over while playing this was how strikingly tedious, dull, and repetitive everything is - and for very little payoff"
gaaarfild,"Apr 9, 2020",0,"I'm playing with my wife and as she is the primary player, I lost the interest in game on the third day. I don't want to play it as there is absolutely nothing to do, than fishing and expanding the house. Any other catchy moments are just spent by the primary player.
Makes 0 point to play it together.
And it's a shame Nintendo you pushing  to buy the second console in that dirty way. It's a cheap move."
Tetsujinsei,"Apr 9, 2020",1,"For a game that's about making friends and togetherness, the game isolates everyone besides the primary player. No one can do anything important besides the primary player such as building important bridges or new houses, why? It would be fine if there were more things to do but there isn't. Exploring seemingly random islands and trying to get the biggest payout for every trip can only be done so many times before I get burnt out. Decorating can only get me so far and from what I've heard there are apparently not many furniture options to decorate with. I want to build a town and see new faces besides the two villagers my wife and I first started out with but I can't do anything, there's no point in being a secondary player in this Animal Crossing. If the secondary player chops trees or mines rocks it renders those resources empty for other players for a while, taking away their resources. Besides that, another huge issue I have with the game is optimization issues. Why do I have to eat one orange at a time? Why not give an option to eat a certain number of food items at one time without having to click over and over again and give it a slightly longer animation? The same thing happens with releasing fish; you need to go into your pockets, click on the fish, click release. This for some reason takes you out of the menu to play the same tired animation. Chances are you have more than one thing you want to drop to empty out your limited inventory so you end up going into your inventory several times and it takes way longer than it should. This game does everything in its power to waste your time like clicking through dozens of text boxes to donate anything for instance. It is such bad design that it makes me not want to play it anymore and it wouldn't matter since secondary players don't matter anyway."
Arthur_Bishop,"Apr 9, 2020",0,"Bought this game for my gf, bored and try to play it myself - see that Nintendo added an arbitrary restriction of one island per console.

Smoku992,"Apr 9, 2020",8,"This is my first animal crossing game, and I have a lot of fun playing it. But there is always something, this game lacks a lot of quality of life features. Basically the game does not care about a player's time and just wastes it. The more I catch bugs of fishes the more I'm getting sick of doing that. Catching bugs is not that bad, but still, I don't want to see the same text every time and catching fishes is even more tiring.  I don't really share my console with different people but it shouldn't be solved like it is now.  I really hope that this will be fixed in future updates. If not I think that a lot of players will abandon this game really fast."
Jjthestrawb,"Apr 9, 2020",9,"I know that lots of people have been review bombing New Horizons due to the one island per Switch feature. I'm the only player on my island, so it doesn't affect me.
I just love the game and, whilst it is lacking in a few features at the moment (cafe, art gallery etc.), it has been all but confirmed that some of these features will be added into the game via free (probably) updates. Once these updates release, the game will be a perfect 10 for me, but for now, it must stay at a 9"
Mattj317,"Apr 9, 2020",0,"Rip off. In a time when real life resources are scarce due to record **** global unemployment numbers, the greedy suits at Nintendo expect their loyal fans to shell out hundreds (thousands, depending on household size) of dollars in order for everyone in your household to have the same full game experience. One switch? One game copy? To bad, peasants! Only one member of your house can have the full game experience while everyone else is left chopping wood, clacking stone, and sneaking into their 6 year old's game account at night to see any game progress at all because said 6 year old is a do-nothing Island Rep who only wants to chase butterflies all day. For the uninitiated,  the Island Rep is the only player who can trigger missions and game progress. They are the only one who can place structures, complete ""story"" missions, and have access to certain DIY recipes and mission rewards.

You'll never see what's on the other side of that river unless you have a vaulting pole. You'll never have a vaulting pole unless you bring Blathers to the island. And, you'll never bring Blathers to the island unless you have a clandestine play session on your child's account after they fall asleep. Worst yet, you're left explaining to your child why their precious ""common butterlfy"" is no longer in their inventory while your Nintendo overlords greedily lap up the tears of your 6 year old as retribution for your insolence in not shelling out the small fortune to buy 4 Switches and 4 game copies."

ShoganUED,"Apr 9, 2020",3,"Poor graphics, no voiced dialogue, small islands, and the worst multiplayer functionality I've ever seen.  Trying to play this co-op with my wife & son is a nightmare.  Even with 2 switches in the house one of us doesn't get an island and can only ""support"" the other 2 people.  We have to buy multiple copies just to do local co-op between the islands.  We each must have a Nintendo online account to visit other friends and family islands.  Like pokemon this game has been stuck in the past, with out of date visuals, audio, and features.  The devs are unwilling or unable to make real improvements in the franchise.  Multiplayer was advertised as a great new feature and disappoints in every possible way."
thaita,"Apr 9, 2020",0,"Awfull nintendo game and the one island policy is a shame.
Don't buy this game if u plan to play as a familly don't ! it's just a problems maker.

The marketing is a  real disgrace.
Money makers gonne too far once again.
Refund will be on his way."
JimmyFeckit,"Apr 9, 2020",4,"Fun game for the first player to arrive on the island. If anyone else in the household plays, they are essentially a meaningless NPC that is unable to impact the story in any meaningful way. Terrible design decision that I hope they will reverse.

The game itself is fun for the most part, even if it feels like it needs more variety after a while. It is clearly a game to just have fun with and if I could actually play the game properly, it might be fun for me. My wife is enjoying it (primary player) though. Multiplayer aspect is incredibly shallow too, I expected more from that.

I would say if Nintendo reverses their boneheaded single island move, it could be winner but they have sold a bajillion copies of it and likely dont care. Nintendo = Tom Nook."

Buy DOOM Eternal if you are frustrated."
barfnarf,"Apr 9, 2020",0,Thia game has caused nothing but grief in my house because of the 1 island per switch rule
MartinJoren,"Apr 9, 2020",0,"First: my  bad score is based on the fact that only ONE island can be used per console.

My gameplay review is a lot better. I've only played it for a few days so still exploring but WOW, there are so many options to discover. I found myself playing every time for just 'one little bit more' and a few hours have passed. I really like the casual looks and simple gameplay. I haven't got a Nintendo Online membership but so far I don't really miss it. Maybe I will get one later on because of the nice options to visit other people's islands to get more exotic species of fruit etc.
My review would be a lot better if Nintendo would allow to have my other family members have their own island in stead of 'plundering' mine.

If you play alone definetely buy one, if you have a famliy i would really reconsider unless you like to make really strict rules regarding playing on one island...."

bigfarken,"Apr 9, 2020",10,Most of the negative reviews here are about console/island limitations. Imagine being poor hahahahaha just buy another switch. Imagine coming to bomb a review page and blame a game because YOU cannot afford your own console. 10/10 Game of the Year.
LilZenith,"Apr 9, 2020",0,"As if being quarantined in real life wasn’t enough, the creators thought it was appropriate to quarantine you with your household in the game as well. And it gets worse, they implemented dictator rules so only the first person to play actually gets to enjoy the game fully like making choices and advancing in the game while everyone else at most is a supporting character by force. They don’t even get a tutorial on how to play. Absolutely the most anti family friendly move from a family friendly console. Trash game."

bepbop,"Apr 9, 2020",1,"The fact that you can only have one island per switch console is a huge downer. I wanted to play the game independantly from my family (because I'm a mega sweat player) But I cannot, because whoever played the game first is basically ""lord supreme dictator"" of the island.
I will happily revise my review upon further changes. But my experience with the game feels like something out of a pay-to-win mobile game...

freeprince,"Apr 9, 2020",8,"Too much review bombing over the single island thing. No, the game isnt 100% flawless but what game is?  Every day you find something new. It's entertaining, sweet, and nearly endless.  I am a companion account. My wife is the main account.  I have no problem playing and enjoying myself.  It's more a single player game with multiplayer capabilities.  Not a multiplayer multi island type of game.  1 island per copy."
G33ch,"Apr 8, 2020",1,"The limitations on anyone other than the initial player are absolutely ridiculous.   This was a huge disappointment for me as my wife started the island (one island per switch) and I was left as an ancillary character when I joined in.   The game play looked fun when she was playing, such a shame."
SayntMyk,"Apr 8, 2020",5,"To clarify, if your a single person with a single switch then this game is a 10/10 from just about every aspect except ethically. If your a couple or family with one switch then feel free to continue reading.

This was my wife and I’s first entry into the Animal Crossing series. We have 1 Switch for our household ( yea you already know where this is going ), and I have to say I’m more than bummed that the game treats every other profile other than the first to boot up the game as an obvious player 2. Fact is, this game doesn’t work as it is on a multi user Switch.

I get the reason behind this both from a consumer and business point of view however, that doesn’t excuse what a blatant attempt this is to push more Switch consoles out. And frankly this makes no sense, in fact it goes against their online subscription business model where you can either buy for an individual or family (8). Clearly one console is designed to be used by many users so why aren’t the save features of this first party title. This review comes from 2 people with 1 switch. As the game can only be enjoyed fully by one of us and is useless to the other, it gets a 5/10. Great job Nintendo on successfully torpedoing this clearly entry level game into the series for new players."
asies123,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"I loved this game until it literally made me have a fight with my boyfriend over the 2nd player being a glorified visitor.

Nintendo should either make the resident representative title a transferable one or let one have multiple savefiles with the game, it truly destroyed any positive feelings I had towards this game.

I would ask for a refund but I can't go to the store due to the coronavirus"
crsn00,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"I bought this game for my wife and wanted to try it myself. The fact that I cannot have my own save on my own account is the stupidest decision ever! The 2nd rate citizen I am demoted to with no ability to modify the town eliminates the only reason I even wanted to play in the first place... Secondly, the cutscenes in the online play are infuriating! Every time someone comes or goes it plays a 30 second cutscene that you can't skip making it impossible to get anything done! Trying to leave someone's island took literally 20 minutes! I wouldn't spend $1 on this game knowing what I do now... Screw you Nintendo"
Starfree,"Apr 8, 2020",6,"It’s still amazingly good, but having to unlock basic features like the museum and the town hall just feels wrong. And while the crafting we very much welcome for furniture. For tools it feels limiting, and this series is not a game that you should feel limited in. Having to get island to a 3 star rating by doing stuff that you don’t wanna do like planting flowers and building fences is also not really fun. I was expecting K.K. on the first Saturday and I was really excited for him but then I learned that I have to unlock him? This game is a Sim, why do I have to unlock basic features? It’s an amazing game and I would recommend it to anyone. But i personally think **** Valley and Rune Factory are way better games to just relax and simulate life."
Flexosuarous,"Apr 8, 2020",7,"Preface: I've been playing animal crossing since the gamecube game and AC is one of my favorite gaming series of all time... that being said, this game is a bit of a disappointment.

Things I like:
-Customizing island via terraforming
-crafting items as a means of gaining furniture
-the island tours
-the graphics
-the music
- ability to place items outside
- the fencing system
-the general gameplay
- camera controls inside home
-Happy Home Designer inspired customization features inside of home

Things I don't like:
-Very lacking list of obtainable furniture
-No nintendo items
- many missing furniture sets from previous games
- The available furniture is uninspired and bland
-only two stores available, no brewsters, no kicks, no garden store
- No ressetti
-No art, Redd, or art wing of museum
-Nooks store only upgrades once
-Can't buy crafted furniture from catalog
- crafting tools is nothing more than an annoyance
- Golden tools break so there's no point in unlocking them
- Isabelle telling me absolutely nothing at the beginning of every day
- the fish and insects are no longer animated when viewing the fish/insect dex
- not fish/ bug sizes
- I've already said this in a way... BUT HAVING TO CRAFT TOOLS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS MADDENING

This game took 2 Steps forward with the increased customization of the island outside of one's home, placing furniture outside is great and really changes the game - but this game took 50 steps back with all of the cut material. All in all, its a decent enough game and I have enjoyed my time with it... but I'm starting to realize how empty it is. It really just makes me want to go back and play animal crossing new leaf. If i'm only going to have two stores anyways, I'd rather play wild world.
Being able to customize the island is cool and all, but it really doesn't make up for losing so much of what has made this franchise great. I hope that more of the cut content is added in the future. If we never get more shops, and nintendo items aren't added, I can't see myself playing this game for very long. I'll likely go back to new leaf or wild world. In those games I absolutely loved getting all the furniture I could in order to make my house as unique and homely as possible... in new horizons I have three rooms, two of which are completely empty because the furniture I have obtained is so boring...

Thanks for reading."
Carrottopadc,"Apr 8, 2020",1,"The one island is absolutely unacceptable. Why could they not give multiple saves? Why do I have to share my resources if I want to play with someone else? It makes no sense, and it’s ruining the game for me. Also having to wait for specific parts of the day. I work and I’m very busy more often than not, and the time sensitive specs are enraging when you compare it to the original Animal crossing where you would just go to sleep. I recommend you just play the original on the GameCube then delve into this game"
SloppyPancake66,"Apr 8, 2020",7,"A great Animal Crossing game.  Keeping the core mechanics with some added features.  Aninal Crossing has been a part of my childhood for so long.  One complaint I do have is the extremely lackluster music.  It's like they said ""Hey, this title music sounds cool.  What can we make with this theme?""  I really wish they put more effort into music design, otherwise a really great staple Aninal Crossing game."

animalsloth,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"They had the audacity to advertise this as a ""family"" game, yet only the first profile on the console who started the game first can actually experience the story and progress, while player 2 will have to share the island and is pretty much a ""visitor"" with no control over what happens, no point gathering resources, even the animals treat you like a visitor. It pretty much ruins the whole experience. They obviously did this out of pure greed to sell more switch consoles and i have lost all respect for them.  All I can ask is please bring in an update where, even if they wont let other people on the console have their own island, at least let us have the option of equal control. This game really could have been great if they didnt ruin it by doing this.."
CultCoop,"Apr 8, 2020",9,"Great game overall, almost a 10, but bogged down slightly by the “1 island per switch” problem, though not directly affecting me, I know that the issue has worsened the experience for others."
QuesoCaeso,"Apr 8, 2020",6,"The game is limiting on how to get Five stars on your island, it has a set way of calculating how your island is rated but it clashes with themes and styles of building ones island. It grades based on the amount of items in the Island, meaning you can just literally fill the island with random items anywhere and get five stars but the island doesn’t look how you’d like it. For example, I was told by Isabelle that I have too many trees and it was problem for my ratings but my islands theme is overgrown... it worked beautifully in new leaf"
Phillips126,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"I created an account on metacritic just to post this review.  The limit of one island per console is utterly ridiculous.  Was there no thought put into this by Nintendo?  My 9 year old daughter was the first to play this game and as one can expect, the island is littered with items with no thought to building a ""perfect"" little world.  This is great for her, she enjoys herself... but the rest of the members in my household have to suffer.  We cannot contribute anything to her island and we are unable to create islands ourselves to build OUR visions of the perfect utopia.  This needs to be fixed immediately as only one person can truly enjoy this game per console!  Please at least make it one island per account/user on the Switch!"

gabriot,"Apr 8, 2020",2,"If this game were made by ANY OTHER company than Nintendo they would have never gotten the free pass by critics this milquetoast sub mediocre uninspired trashbag **** received.

It's one of the worst games I've played on the Switch.  Where to even begin.

For starters, the completely F-U Nintendo gave to fans of people that have multiple family members that play on their Switch is just beyond excusable.  If you aren't the main player account of the switch you a.)  Cannot create a different island b.)  Can't visit anyone online without linking and paying for a completely brand new online account and c.)  Can't actually advance the game AT ALL and have to wait for the main account player to actually progress the game for everyone else.  This is some ActiBlizzard level BS I wouldn't expect from Nintendo, scary sign for things that may be to come.

But even if all that were fixed it's still just such a bad game.  There's NOTHING to do here!  Seriously what is there to do?  The crafting system is the most rudimentary I've ever seen in a game, the graphics ****, the dialogue - oh my GOD the dialogue is mind numbingly frustrating.  90% of it is meaningless, but it just goes on and ON and ON AND ON!!  You just sit there pressing the ""a"" button over and over again rolling your eyes that you have to sit through yet another endless bit of dialogue that goes in circles and circles, repeating the same thing he's saying over and over and OVER AGAIN.  For instance in a recent update there is a bunny that lets you know there are eggs to be found for a limited amount of time until Easter (or ""Egg Day"" as their PC overlords commanded them to call it).  That's all he says in essence, but it takes 20 freaking pages of dialogue going in circles over and over again that you have to sit through for him to say it.

And on that note every single npc in this game just has literally nothing to say, like EVER.  No personality, no actual tasks to be done, no real interactions, NOTHING!  It's just such a bad game.  How anyone can enjoy this is beyond me.  Avoid it like the plague."
Impa_1,"Apr 8, 2020",0,This is disgusting to force people buy a second console in addition to enjoy the game in couple. You've just ruin your reputation Nintendo. You ****.

Sounds pretty stupid, why is Switch any different?

The people defending this terrible, corporate greed design choice choice seem to have the argument ""Oh but this is how the last game was""

Its cool to have a limited co-op feature, but why is this the only option?
why can't the second player play through the full-featured single player game?
Well, everyone knows why."
Kopchony,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"This is very addictive and colorful game with awfully slow dialogue system, horrible online multiplayer. Looks like developers haven't heard of internet existing.

This is a fantastic game for whoever plays first, but I have to drop it 5 points for for this one issue alone. I can only see my youngest getting frustrated he can't do certain things without getting on the oldest ones account. I'm new to animal crossing, and apparently this holds true to formula, but this is a Nintendo Switch. Utilize it's potential and make separate islands we can all have freedom to make our own decisions on. If you want to stick to the one island, make it so each island is linked to each other (separated by rivers, and later accessable using bridges). Major oversight in console gaming and it's obvious the community isn't happy. Time to switch up the formula on the Switch devs. Pretty sure this will be a one and done for our household."
DannTheHuman,"Apr 8, 2020",0,One island per console (meaning only one user gets the first-playing experience) on a $59 game? You must be crazy.
Joewhite41,"Apr 8, 2020",1,"As expected the game is brilliantly fun and relaxing, I haven't skipped a day playing it since it came out and I don't see myself doing so in the future, however does that mean the game is actually any good? Well the short answer is no. The reason I come back every day is because you have to, if you want to choose which villagers you have in your town you have to come back every day and hope someone is staying at the campsite as it's near impossible to find them on islands. if you want to fill your house with furniture you actually like you're basically just hoping to get something good in the store every day. If you want something to do you have to hope there's an NPC in the village that day. It's been less than a month since it came out and I'm already just logging on, checking my shops, getting my message in a bottle, collecting my nook miles, and leaving as that's really all there is to do. I cannot decorate my town or my house any more as I've got no more furniture that would look good. I can't get new villagers because they barely show up on islands, I can't progress with the story as the amount of stars your village has depends only on having more villagers (my friend regularly tells me he wishes his island looked like mine, but he has three stars because he has 10 villagers whereas I have one because I have six villagers), I cannot try to grind bells as nearly everything ends up being an egg during this event. There really is absolutely nothing to do. then there's the huge cutscene that means it can take nearly two minutes just to go to someone else's island and every time someone comes to your island you have to stop what you're doing and wait for the stupidly long cutscene, Not to mention the fact you cannot play on two accounts unless you want to share an Island which puts you at a huge disadvantage. Overall just not a well thought-out and designed game."
DestinyLord1134,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"This game is completely ruined by the fact you need to have 2 concoles and 2 games to play in the same household, especially when the price for entry is currently over 500 dollars for the console and game because of price gouging."
iicho7,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"The game lacks the feature of Cloud Saving or, at least, transferring progress between consoles.

MrSparko,"Apr 8, 2020",2,"Disappointing that families that share a switch can’t have their own save file and island.

rmscouto,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"People saying that ""you can only have one island per switch"" are being too benevolent. In fact, you can only have one gameplay per switch! The first player/account to play will be the Resident Representative, meaning that he/she will have the full gameplay experience. Remaining player will not be able to: create an island, name an island, take part in the decisions (e.g. make buildings), invite NPC (e.g. Bladders). Basically, you can have one player per console, remaining ones are ""playable residents"". Nice touch Nintendo, specially given the time of release (covid19)"
bam0909,"Apr 8, 2020",0,"Give second players more freedom. I understand that the reason that they built the game this way was that ""they want people to connect"".

EeveeAfterDark,"Apr 7, 2020",8,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is absolutely gorgeous and relaxing switch game with some minor flaws that hold it back just a bit. The game starts you off from scratch as you have you have to build your own island basically all by yourself with only Tom Nook's small residential services tent in place to get you started. Not only do you have to pick a spot to put your tent to live but you also pick the locations of your first 2 villagers as well as future 8 other villagers as in order to keep with the starting from scratch theme you have to find most of your villagers yourself. Personally, I really like the idea of starting from scratch as it really feels like i have full control over my island and that everything on it has made because of me.

The game goes by real time and every single day you have something new to do such as picking fruit from your trees, hitting rocks to get materials such as iron nuggets and filling up your town museum with bugs, fish, and fossils you find. But in order to get buildings such as the museum to access more things you do, Tom Nook gives you tasks every day to help gain the access to new buildings and functions. The game is very relaxing to me as I can just go day by day slowly building up my town but not having to do everything all at once. It gives me a reason to come back every day.

The game heavily features a brand new crafting system that use to create almost everything on the island including your own tools. This is where my first small issue is, while the crafting is fantastic and adds to the experience, the tools that you use everyday can break unlike previous Animal Crossing games and it happens enough to be tedious to have to get the supplies and then re-craft them. Also kind of **** is accounts on the same system all have to share an island instead of getting to create their own. Online multiplayer is a bit annoying as it has a very sluggish start as you always wait a few minutes for a cut scene to play as a new person arrives and even when they are there functions are limited on the island.

Though while these issues are certainly a pain in the butt at times it still isn't enough to deter from the lovely relaxing life simulation game that is Animal Crossing New Horizons. If you want something to just relax and play its definitely worth your time
8/10"

MilkReviews,"Apr 7, 2020",10,"I feel like a vast majority of the bad reviews are talking about the bad multiplayer, but none of them are talking about the actual game. I love this game, and honestly think that this is the most casual and relaxing experience I have ever had in a form of media. From the music, to the gameplay, to the amazing visuals, this game is a masterpiece. 10/10"
DaWizardMan2822,"Apr 7, 2020",10,"The best game in the series yet, all the new mechanics are a breath of fresh air for the series."
kinktwink,"Apr 7, 2020",10,"So many angry reviews on this one because of the one island per console feature. I'm not entirely sure why people are so surprised given this is information that's been commonly known for months now.

Anyway, I think this game is perfect. The graphics are extremely polished and there's always something to do. The pacing can be extremely relaxing, or you can time skip to get things done quicker. Strongly recommend if this is your type of game."
TheAlucard,"Apr 7, 2020",2,There are lots of features taken out of this game from previous games. Seems like Nintendo really just threw this game together. It’s becoming more and more disappointing every day. Previous titles have way more content.
Amitai,"Apr 7, 2020",0,"This is falsely advertised as a local multiplayer game. Party Mode is just singleplayer with the others only allowed to walk around. The Resident Representative mechanic locks all the other players out of making any progression in the game.

This is a very good game for one player, but I refuse to give it a single point because I am disgusted with what Nintendo can get away with."
Gingerbal,"Apr 7, 2020",1,its okay. Multi-player is awful. The game only progresses as far as player one progresses
Volpatron9000,"Apr 7, 2020",2,Im addicted to this game however i have some major issues. First is the one island per console isnt a wise move. Second there's literally zero new content after you renovate the store ONCE NPCS are nonexistent besides villagers blathers the nooks and isabelle ( i don't count the dodos **** those guys ) like how can you have a 2020 release game have less content than the 3ds game that came out in 2012... wheres brewster wheres gracie wheres resetti?? And that rescue app doesn't count. This game is overall extremely disappointing it pretty much boils down to a happy home designer spinoff disguised as a triple a title. Im beginning to thing that they made the beginning slow on purpose to pad out the game a little bit. I can't believe this is the game we've been waiting for i hope they update it soon or come out with an expansion pack or dlc because i feel ripped off and i got this as a gift. Smh Nintendo you didnt ruin animal crossing but you definitely watered it down 2/5 compared to the other games i dont want to give it a one or a zero because the game is stunning to look at but besides that its a shadow of its former self still fun to play but i got way more enjoyment out of new leaf i still haven't unlocked everything in that game and ive been time traveling like crazy in that game. For at least a year on and off but i've pretty much unlocked everything in less than two weeks in this one... its comparable to mgsv ground zeroes and thats not a compliment
pedroxmodeZ,"Apr 7, 2020",9,"O jogo é absolutamente tudo que um fã de Animal Crossing poderia querer, quase 30 horas de jogo e sinto que minha ilha tá apenas 10% do que eu queria e ainda há coisas a serem desbloqueadas, problema de 1 ilha por console é o que afasta o jogo da perfeição"
PepeLePuke,"Apr 7, 2020",10,Fun relaxing time waisting game. It's a shame that you can't have more than one island. Other wise the game is great.

Mirr,"Apr 7, 2020",4,No se pueden crear dos islas en la misma consola. Por el resto aunque aveces algunas mecánicas son algo tediosas no es nada preocupante excepto lo de que te puedan dar recetas repetidas eso es horrible porque te puedes tirar muchísimo tiempo y no tener una mesita de noche como me ha pasado a mí por ejemplo.
AceRimmer80,"Apr 7, 2020",0,"The multi user feature has ruined the game. Another user has started a game on the Switch and now as a second user I cannot access simple tools leaving me nothing to do. Very poor  , a waste of money"
Exiee,"Apr 7, 2020",1,"The game costs £50, a switch costs hundreds, yet nintendo expects users to buy another console if they wish to start a new island. Its money grabbing and scummy. I'm not giving this 0, because for whatever reason doing that would invalidate how shady and terrible that move was on nintendo's part. They market it as multiplayer, yes, but only on one island. Only one account holds full control.They clearly dont consider how a family might feel, how that would work for families with kids, multiple children. I dont want my brother ruining my save file, I dont want to restart it either, just to have a Dr sh experience while  waiting for bunny day to end. waiting for bunny day to finally end."
Civ9,"Apr 7, 2020",10,"Best game ever if you don't have to share your island with anyone. I feel it was designed for people between 25 and 30 years old.

Don't miss this game just because the low ratings due to the one island per console issue, if you live alone you won't regret!"
Kathrinkent,"Apr 7, 2020",8,"Some things that would improve the game 1) having your home inventory connected to all the work benches on your island or at least the one in your home
2) have the golden tools be unbreakable its sooo annoying to have to keep remaking things
3) have nooo pay you for your wook"
PinkSpartan,"Apr 7, 2020",2,"I bought this game knowing that it was one ""shared"" island per console, which to be honest, I was ok with. I am not ok with secondary accounts treated like second class citizens. I give this a 2 because I can only experience 20% of the game. I share a console with my brother and it was taking me days to figure out how to get a shop. Turns out only the first account can progress the game. For Pete's sake I can't even build a bridge.

I hope Nintendo fixes this, as it really damages the playing experience."
Plantdadrob,"Apr 7, 2020",1,It’s a great game but the switch is shared between my partner and I. He created an account first and created the island. I’ve been more interested and put more hours in but can’t progress unless he progresses first. Wish multiplayer was better and everyone could get the same game experience.
GaryGaryGary,"Apr 7, 2020",2,"We bought this to play as a family and wanted especially to encourage our 6 year old daughter to get involved. We made her the main resident, and carried on from there. What we didn’t know is that the remaining three of us are basically just passengers in her game. She hasn’t taken to it like we hoped and now the rest of us can’t do anything because the island won’t progress. We wanted to all be on the same island so this would help us anyway, but you can’t even decide to have an island each. You’re just stuck. I’m sure the single player game is fine, but don’t bother with it if you’re looking for the couch multiplayer."
DarkFireUmad,"Apr 7, 2020",8,"Mi problema con este nuevo juego es que son muy interesante las cosas nuevas que meten como el crafteo y que sea una isla desierta y tengas que ir poblándola y tal, pero tal vez me hubiese gustado más un juego como los anteriores."
dothackv2,"Apr 7, 2020",10,This is a great game. Don't listen to the review bombers this is the best AC game ever.
Beyie,"Apr 7, 2020",9,A slow burn as it usually is with animal crossing and a bit grindy but once in the swing of things its non stop! Fully enjoying the freedom that this game gives!!
Bovril,"Apr 7, 2020",0,"Wow, I wish I’d read the reviews before buying this. Not having multiple islands on 1 Switch has left my daughter in tears and my son defensive about his island. I wouldn’t have bought this knowing the problems it was going to cause especially as it was supposed to help during the lock down. Poor show Nintendo."
EmoDrake,"Apr 7, 2020",0,"This is a beautifully made game with hours to enjoy, but unfortunately Nintendo took this awesome game and used it to try and boost their switch sales by forcing households who only have one switch to buy Multiple.

If you are the first person you get to experience everything the game has to offer. There isn't anything you don't have access to. You can get new villagers, Build stores, paths, bridges, and even change the landscape to truly make the island yours.

If you are the second person to play on the console, you get to experience one aspect of Animal Crossing. You get to make a cool house. That's it. You cannot get new villagers to the island and you can't build bridges or paths. You might as well be playing as another Animal who takes up residence on the island. It isn't your island, you are just a guest.

The fact that Nintendo consciously made the decision to force households to buy multiple consoles if everyone in the household wants to experience all this new game has to offer shows exactly how greedy the company has gotten.

Yes I am fully aware that, as a company, they want to pull in as much profit as possible, but all this decision has done is made consumers angry and against the idea of giving them more money to feed their greed.

Great Job creating a wonderful game and ruining it with your greed Nintendo."
StopHatingbro,"Apr 7, 2020",10,"Don't listen to anyone about the 1 island thing, this is probably one of the best games in the series. Sure you start off with one island, but you gain terraforming to grow them, and you can use another in-game currency, Nooks Miles, to buy a ticket to an uninhabited island, sometimes even friends will be there from past games to invite back. There is no frame drops and a lot more improvement when it comes to graphics, you can change the music on the island and place where you'd like most buildings and structures to go for your society. It's the same animal crossing with improvements. There is plenty more to decorate your house with, multiple rooms along with the expansion of your house, and Isabelle.... just Isabelle. Upgrades for inventory, tools, overall improvements to the hud, I could go on forever, a lot of these people are mad about a single island, but it's the size of a single town in Animal Crossing, so a lot of people are crybabies, because not only can you visit other islands in multiplayer, but if you don't have friends visiting villagers in game invite you to theirs and you can go to uninhabited ones. Some crybabies need to grow up."
asdflkjh,"Apr 7, 2020",0,"Game was advertised as multiplayer. Multiplayer is worse than I could imagine. It's not just poorly done, it's deliberately broken as a design decision. It's mind boggling. And if you don't like it, you can't even have two users with their own single player game. I got it for two of us, but now I don't play because there's only so much that can be done in a real-world day. One player can use it up. And (this is more a switch complaint) if a user wants to invite a friend to play, that user needs their own nintendo online subscription. I can't just buy an individual plan for my console, I have to buy a damned family plan... for one console. All of the issues could be trivially fixed, but doing it this way was a deliberate design choice. It pisses me off."
Giel88,"Apr 7, 2020",0,"Bought this game for my girlfriend and me so we could both play on our household Switch. Well, apparently the second player can't do jack ****. What a disappointment."
Justen_101,"Apr 7, 2020",7,"I love this game and almost everything it has to offer. The only BIG issue is that I am the second player because my I let my girlfriend play first. Little did I know that it means that I am completely dependent of her actions to progress in the game. After achieving the 3 star rating that were needed to convince kk slider to come to the island, I could not do anything until my girlfriend would play again. It is very annoying to feel like a second rate villager compared to my girlfriend. If this wasn't a issue, I would gladly give this game a 10+."
AsphaltShip,"Apr 7, 2020",0,"1 island PER CONSOLE with 1 player and up to 7 slaves (aka other players that cannot progress in the game) is a joke!

You can’t transfer data in any way to “prevent cheating”, which is as naive as it is harmful for anyone that found out the first paragraph the hard way or whose console may break.

Multiplayer is a vast joke with one player being nothing more than a portable tool/slave

Also be prepared for durability. Yes: tools break. A lot. Even the best ones break. This is by far the worst AC I’ve played so far and the worst offender is: I was eager to play it. So was a lot of people, and Nintendo will probably only look at the sales"
Babbelheld,"Apr 7, 2020",0,Forcing you to buy a second console if a 2nd player wants to play is a huge scumbag move and should not be tolerated! Do not buy this game if there 2 players in your household
Tabdelno,"Apr 7, 2020",10,This game is saving the sanity of the human race. Brilliantly executed. Lol review bombers.
IImpyy,"Apr 7, 2020",10,This game is simply amazing. This game is amazingly cozy and feels really at home on the switch. It's a game that can be played for eternity. The multiplayer is a little laggy sometimes while playing online but since you can control exactly what other players are allowed to do. Local multiplayer is really boring but that doesn't really effect my experience with this game at all. Anyone who gives this game below a 7 have no idea what they are talking about. This game is a replayable masterpiece.
Savarunl,"Apr 7, 2020",6,"The game is great in some aspects, and really bad in some others/
What i really like in the game:
- The detail of everything in the game
- The, mostly, well written dialogues
- The relaxing vibe of the game

What i dislike in the game:
- Having the same dialogue every time for basic functions (this is also the rare case where the dialogues are not well written, surprisingly) like selling things or turning something in to the museum
- Being allowed only one island per Switch
- The apparent randomness of some things like stacking items (some stack to 99, some to 10, some don't stack at all, etc.)

What really grinds my gears in the ame:
- The horrendous multiplayer. Clicking through 8 dialogues, watching an obnoxious cutscene that also plays for ALL other players in the island you go to and not being able to do basic things when your island is open for other players.
- The speed at which tools breaks, even the improved ones. Making tools over and over and over get's RALLY tedious after a while.
- The placing of items outside your house is absolutely terrible, where you have to hope that you 'aimed' correctly. This get's more apparent when you want to move, for example, a house, and you misplace it by 1-2 tiles, after which you have to pay to move it again.

All in all, i have some enjoyment at times in the game, but the mentioned issues really keep me from enjoying the game to the fullest. If some those points would be improved upon, this game would be magnificent, but for now i can not give it more than a 6/10."
Totte,"Apr 7, 2020",0,"My boyfriend and I bought the game together and he was the first one to play, and now I’m stuck as the 2nd player who don’t get the same experience. It **** because we both payed but now only one really gets the opportunity to play. Really disappointing"

Listairhardaker,"Apr 7, 2020",0,DO NOT BUY if there is more than one person in your house. This game does not work like every other. One full player PER CONSOLE. Avoid until fixed.
Newhorizonssuck,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"I bought this game so me and my family could play it. I started it, then handed it to my sister, who can't start her own island due to Nintendo changing the way saves are done for this game. Instead of treating each profile on the switch like their own save file (like every other game on the switch does), they treat the entire system as one big save file. Which makes the game completely unfair to anyone else. Now my sister is waiting, hoping that Nintendo changes this god awful feature. As she is depressed over the virus, and I fear for her life if she doesn't have something to hope forue to the virus, we are loosing jobs, so we can't afford another system. Not that we want another system anyway. Nintendo has lost a life long customer due to the amount of selfish, crazy decisions they have made within the past two years."
bitzyl,"Apr 6, 2020",10,"I really don't  understand why so many people just show negative view towards the Animal **** you want to explore full version of the game,Just BUT ONE MORE Nintendo Switch. This is your life, all the others are the crossing individuals, If you can start multiple accounts on one NS, You should find out that the true meaning of the game has changed. You could delete any time and anywhere without any hesitation!
I like the strategy one island on one NS.
If you complain about this  just work harder in real life and make money back!
This is what Animal crossing tells us!"
Blayz,"Apr 6, 2020",2,"I’ve literally never been so disappointed in a while. The first and probably most obvious problem that a lot of other people are talking about is the 1st player priority and 1 town per switch. Put it simply, AC is a terrible shared console game (I can say that for literally most of the AC games). Not much of an issue for the last game because it was on the 3ds and people usually got their own 3ds (and even then, I’d argue it was still a better shared console game). It’s even worse in NH because it treats the 1st player special and all the other players are just useless (they can still destroy **** so gl sharing with someone younger). No backup save, no transfer, no alternative way of getting a different town other than giving Nintendo more of your money during a time like this where we’d all rather save it. Of course there are more reasons to hate this game that has nothing to do with the multiplayer based reasons. Remember ordinances? Gone. Swimming? Gone. Coffee shop? Gone. Completely different areas with unique themes that were really useful? Kinda but not as good as before. Perfect fruits? Gone. Reliable tools? Gone. ‘But tools breaking tools adds challenge!’ Challenge as in being obnoxious? Remember this mechanic in BotW? It worked there because 1. I don’t have to go through the same obnoxious crafting cutscene to make one again and 2. The breaking tools actually encouraged conservation and different strategies to fighting, meanwhile in this game, it’s just a strain on your already limited resources that you get once per day (the survival/resource-scavenging thing doesn’t fit AC at all). When you break your fishing rod, there’s no alternative choice than to build another one. Also **** eggs."
CosmicSurfer616,"Apr 6, 2020",9,"Tons to do compared to the original and WW which were the last two in the series I played. So I'll just keep this simple and list the Pros and Cons.
PROS: Tons to do around the island and always having an objective to work towards even if it is at your own pace it's nice to have something to work toward.
The island is always growing and gives you a real sense of progression. It really feels like you're building something great.
Many more residents per island then in the past and more variety when it comes to resident personality.
Over all graphics and visual presentation is great as well as sound design.
The ability to have local co-op is amazing and something I could've only dreamed of as a kid who I played the original with my brother on GameCube.
CONS: One Island per console I know this has been stated to death but it is ridiculous that in this day and age that it's not technically plausible.
The restrictions on co-op are a bit frustrating as I stated I'm stoked that they added local co-op but it just **** they had to make it so **** only they could've added a few more things, I mean simple things like both users being able to manage their menu instead of only the leader that's really all I wish they would've done honestly.. I wouldn't even ask for split screens or anything just the ability for both players to be able to pick up and sell items would've been amazing but instead it just feels like a half measure, it always ends up being a game of watching the leader do things or changing frequently so the other player can get stuff done. Frustrating because it could've been something so great.
Animal Crossing is what amounts to be an amazing game, it just struggles on the multiplayer side of things which has never been Nintendo's strong suit except when it comes to local play so how did they mess it up so bad? It's unfortunate because that is what keeps this from being a full 10 in my eyes. It just feels like maybe the local play was a last minute thing they threw in and didn't get the TLC it deserved. And it just pains me to think of what could've been."
Joami3,"Apr 6, 2020",1,"I am actively writing this review while playing with my husband ""primary account holder"" . I have time to write, because the ""secondary"" player on the switch account can never play a large portion of the game. Without having 2 switches, secondary player has no input on tasks to building up the island. It was my first animal crossing and my husband was excited to introduce me to this game. But so far this game has left me without any experiences, because they're only for the main account holder to complete.. It's a simple fix that Nintendo has refused to acknowledge."
LoneWolf04,"Apr 6, 2020",2,"There are some basic things that should be in the game that aren’t and make things extremely frustrating while playing and customizing your island.

When placing buildings you can “preview” where the building is going but only in your limited field of view. No overhead map to line object up to get an overall perspective. Even though you get this high point of view when a visitor flies to your island. Hell even grids to line things up would be helpful, since they show grids for the plot on the building being placed but nothing around it.

When paying to move a building. If you’re only trying to move a building several spaces to line buildings up, you can’t! Forces you to move it once out of the way and then back again.

With the amount of switch shortages across the world and limiting one island per switch makes no sense. Complete greed and not consumer friendly. Even to limit you being able to move your island transfer to another switch is complete opposite of consumer friendly. I have an OG switch and want to upgrade to a new V2 switch and there has not been a good resolution without jumping through hoops and praying I that I will be able to do so.

Not even 2 weeks into the game release and the update has replaced half your resources you normally farm with “special bunny day eggs” along with an ungodly amount of recipes for the event. It appears several updates to try and help the situation have been released, but still problem-some. This is a prime example of “always-connected” games gone wrong.

Let’s talk about item storage. Why is there not a chest to craft to place outside your home to hold normal items like wood and minerals for crafting? No, I have to go inside my house, wait for a load screen, pick items from storage, craft with an inside crafting table, put things away and then back outside to wait on another load screen. So if an item broke and you didn’t have the resource on you to craft, whatever you were hoping to get will despawn while forced to go in to get items to craft. This is especially painful early on in the game with limited on character storage space.

Now onto the crafting mechanic. If I’m trying to craft multiples of the same item and have the resources to do so, why do I have to go through multiple screens and animations to craft the same item over and over? Talk about time waster.

One last complaint. I had a visitor come to my a campsite. Not a visitor I wanted, but chatted with them to see what they had to say. My only 2 responses were to offer them a house only island. Could not refuse them coming. Only good news is by a quick search result that I can kick them off later after move in and several days.

Don’t get me wrong, the game is fun and offers a lot, but can still be drastically improved on function. Expect a lot of clunky and repetitive animations and not any type fluid gameplay. The game is good by offering things to come back daily and check on resources. But, a lot of free to play games do the same with the same clunky gameplay mechanics. Publisher stepped up the graphics moving from 3DS to switch, but fluid gameplay is lacking for basic mechanics and to keep the game moving forward. The idea of less loading screens to keep the player immersed is something other companies are doing well. This game is lacking that in some key areas as described."
Speed0012,"Apr 6, 2020",0,I think I would like the game but I am unable to progress because my daughter has the primary character. So I am unable to get the full experience. It would be nice if there was a warning in the beginning. Then I would have set myself as the primary and then both of us would enjoy the game.
TwoFaceTiger,"Apr 6, 2020",7,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great game, but does have some downsides.

I have been playing this game over 2 weeks now and I love it. gathering fossils, fishing, bug catching and as of now the bunny day(week) event.  As i have seen online most people had their island mostly done by time traveling, as for me i will be not time traveling . But this is a game that keeps me coming back and slowly watching my island grow with each new finished project or a new guest comes and visits the island. But as i am playing game it can/gets boring after 2 hours of gameplay,  but because there only so much you can do in a real time game.

But overall If you are big Fan or new comer to Animal Crossing series this a game that is worth checking picking up.

Will update later in the year!"
Zedsnack,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"I had been looking forward to this game for a long time, but unfortunately I share my switch console with another AC player. So now I have to share an island and when I log on there aren't even sticks left to complete the DIY workshop. On top of that if I want my own island I can't even blow money on a second copy of the game; I would have to buy an entire new console. What a joke."
ShellfishShelly,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"Great looking game, wish I wasn’t gated from doing anything as the second person to play it on the system. Another case of trash design on a great game."
Sw4gz1ll4,"Apr 6, 2020",3,"Me and my wife got it pre-ordered. We were super excited to start playing it and actually share the one-console island. The excitement lasted until limitations kicked in. The non-representative player can be described as a visitor with few privileges. Your progress is limited by player 1 and you cannot move buildings, build bridges, reserve lots for new residents, demolish bridges, upgrade shops... Basically what you can do is sit and watch player one have fun. We have no problem with shared resources as other players have experienced (which I believe may be a problem depending on whom you share your island), but not being able to shape and modify the island I'm a resident, just ****. I've played roughly 60h by now and this will be probably it. There is just nothing fun to do anymore."
ClapTrap229,"Apr 6, 2020",5,"It's a great game, but there is a big problem: when the first person who create your island don't play anymore or just less than you, you don't have a complete access to the game."
bigbooty,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"No cloud saves. No legitimate local multiplayer. No sharing the game between users on the same switch. No save transfer between consoles. This game is a massive failure on a technical level by 2020 standards, and embarrassingly even by the original Animal Crossing from 19 years ago, which didn't lock your save to the console."
kangamangusmang,"Apr 6, 2020",0,Sure it's a great game if you are the only player but Nintendo can get **** for the 2nd player limitations they've instituted. Don't buy this unless you support Nintendo's ploy to hold customers ransom in hopes that they'll buy a whole second or third console just so everyone in the house can play this game.
KillUEz,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"To the people who call the backlash an unjustified review bombing you probably are playing single player and have no issues. To rank a game on just a part of it and expect everyone else to ignore the giant issue and give the game an A+ is stupid. Also there were complaints about single island before the game even came out and they never bothered fixing it. The only way they are going to fix it is by people vocally saying ""It's a problem and making the game unenjoyable to many"".

I wouldn't mind buying a 2nd copy of the game but needing a 2nd switch at the cheapest 260$ per switch plus the games 80$ each for a whopping total of 680$(CAD) for two people to enjoy their own island is absurd. There is no point in buying a 2nd console just for Animal crossing alone.  Nintendo is turning into Bethesda/Blizzard. Wouldn't be surprised if mtx and lootboxes or other ""surprise mechanics"" on the way.

When you have a game that you own and can't even get yourself motivated to play it despite loving the genre and 100s of hours in past entries simply because you have two players and one console you truly deserve a 0."
Waterdog,"Apr 6, 2020",4,"So I have been enjoying the game. I've been working on my island and have gotten pasted nooks cranny but then my brother ask to play. Now I have it downloaded on my switch, this would be fine if f@#king animal crossing worked like any other 60 dollar game on switch. I went to do something while my brother started his game. Then when I came back I noticed that his airport was near where my air port was then I saw my house and before I could say anything he put his tent down and now it is just f#*king stuck in my game. This is the most aggravating cheap a$$ move I've ever seen Nintendo pull. This game would straight up be a 10 if my brother didn't exist or much better if Nintendo had more than one f%#king brain cell. I will not be mad at my brother because he is younger than me and he just wanted to play animal crossing but I need to be mad at someone because now my f#&king town has a random a$$ tent in it."
SimQueen,"Apr 6, 2020",0,This game is probably fantastic but I cannot play it in anyway it’s truly meant to be because they only allow one person per console to play the game. I don’t care that one island. Can support 8 players because there is only one person able to do anything fun. They rest are just sentient NPCs. It’s unfair and unjustifiable. It’s completely unrealistic to expect families to spend a minimum of 270 dollars for every person who wants to play this game the way it should be played. No other games have this restriction meaning this was done intentionally to drag more money out of already paying customer. Ridiculous. Big fail on Nintendo’s side.
Troutpond,"Apr 6, 2020",0,One island per console ruined the entire game for those who have to share the console.
LordBoatrace,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"I bought the game on a Switch shared by my wife and me, and I created my character and visited the island first. Then she created her character and visited the island (you can only have one island on a console). Come to find out, she can't progress at all in the game until I play it, and she doesn't have any ability to improve the island on her own. What an absolutely boneheaded game design. If you plan on having multiple people play this game at once, I would warn you not to waste your money."
asabetpa,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"If you have more than 1 person using the game, it's worthless. Until they fix player 2 story line, don't get the game. I'm done with nintendo unless they fix this. Huge waste of money."
Carl09,"Apr 6, 2020",0,One island per switch! Disgusting... Do not purchase until problem is rectified. Bought to play with family and now my purchase means nothing and I'm diminished to playing follow the leader. Considering moving onto a console that respects their clients.
Cornpops,"Apr 6, 2020",6,Do not buy this game if you are looking to share it with someone; only the player who started the game is able to progress the story and develop the island. The majority of the new and interesting features shown in gameplay trailers will be unavailable to other players. These unnecessary restrictions ruin an otherwise enjoyable game.
Kbarlow96,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"Disappointed. My partner and I bought this game for our Nintendo Switch and while she's player 1 and enjoying the game very much, I have no enjoyment or desire to progress with the game due to the ridiculous and downright appaling decision to limit one island per switch rather than one island per user. That is all."
Hansss1987,"Apr 6, 2020",1,"To be honest, this is a great game. It's very laid back and destressing. I like everything about it, except one really big issue. I don't want to be an ordinary villager who can't do anything besides collecting and gathering stuff.  It really blows to be the second player. Nintendo, let us enjoy our very own island and give everyone in the household the full experience!"
BrendaSweet_,"Apr 6, 2020",8,Overall the game is great! The only thing that really bothers me is that villagers always say the same things... they don't seem to have a real character anymore... and their sentences are always really short and sometimes pretty mean. It would be great if Nintendo could re-work that :)
adrewtoremember,"Apr 6, 2020",8,"Review bombers have formed a very vocal echo chamber on here, but instead of focusing on the negatives that can be fixed, the game itself is objectively one of the best in the series. For those new to the AC experience, don't expect a ton of varied gameplay. ACNH is designed to be a relaxing life sim that has you return for short bursts of play rather than keeping you for hours at a time.

ACNH has the most customization of any Animal Crossing title, allowing a wide variety of furniture and decorations to be customized to your liking.

It is obnoxious that there is only one island per console, and that player 2 really doesn't have much to do until the main player progresses, but a lot of these issues were disclosed well before launch.

It is still a great game, and it is still Animal Crossing."
Deathpad,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"Nintendo worst company ever. You don't care about customers, but you are nothing without us. Once island per switch, shame on you !!!"
Crow83,"Apr 6, 2020",0,No tiene sentido que dos personas no puedan tener cada uno su propia isla. Muy decepcionado la verdad
Hoobala,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"Either allow more islands per console or allow all players on the single Island to have equal rights and and resposibilities to contribute to all aspects of Island life.  Failing these options, there should at the very least be some way for the citizen representative pass there role to another player.  Shocking design choice for a game advertised as multiplayer in the year 2020."
wesker2012,"Apr 6, 2020",5,"I wanted to try out Animal Crossing because of the fans.  I played for about a week and while relaxing, I started to realize it wasn't my kind of game.  It was just too simplistic in what you could do in the game.  I know the game expands later but it just took too much time for me to get there without the feeling of incentive to come back.  It also felt a bit too kiddish for me.  The slow progression of the game was really too slow for me and just felt like there wasn't much game there.  Also, the villagers wouldn't say much of interest and repeat the same things, and while I like games where you have to figure out things on your own, it also wasn't very intuitive on what to do at times for new players to the series.  In my experience, it felt very half baked.  The core gameplay felt like what I could do in other games which are a lot more fun, varied, and engaging.  The one main plus was the cute, polished hd visuals."
TriStarr,"Apr 6, 2020",1,"I don't care that you get one island per Switch. That seems like a design choice that allows families to play together. What is ridiculous is that the 2nd person to play the game cannot advance without the 1st person to play doing so first.  I didn't realize this mechanic until about 10 hours in, so now we have to start from scratch.  Why isn't there an option to just switch the Resident Representative??"
LordDoran,"Apr 6, 2020",10,"Anyone rating this game a 2 or lower is an actual baby. ""Game don't do what I want, wah wah"". Grow up. They told you this from the beginning. Cancel culture is the absolute worst and being abused now on creations that are genuinely a great experience. Get over yourself keyboard Kevin, and focus more on getting out of your mother's basement than how many islands you and your imaginary partner are able to play on."
confusedlin,"Apr 6, 2020",0,"I got the game as a birthday gift but let my sister play too as she had long wanted to play this game. I made the mistake of letting her play first, consequently I became the Player 2 and only then realized I couldn't create my own island. There really isn't that much fun to do as a Player 2, I am really disappointed. I really hope Nintendo fixes this issue."
Nicgaming,"Apr 5, 2020",10,This is one of the best games I've ever played in my life. It dose have it's flaws but everything does so it isn't worth giving a bad rating just to try to prove something.
iborrelli,"Apr 5, 2020",2,Super disappointed. It looks like fun. My girlfriend never plays video games and in the midst of COVID-19 thought something to keep her occupied was a good idea. And she has been enjoying it while I've been working from home. And I was very excited to play it but when I started it put me on her island. I checked the internet and then the box and in fine print it says you can only have one island on one switch. I'm sorry I didn't check first but why would anybody expect that or expect Nintendo to have fine print. I never played animal crossing before so I didn't know that was the standard for these games. Just expected this to be another great game for the switch and now I'm just disappointed Nintendo would screw users like this. Thanks for wasting my time and money. Never been so disappointed in a Nintendo product. Glad I haven't bought Mario Party and let my friends suffer the lack of care Nintendo had providing awful online multiplayer and 4 boards.
AngeloGSC,"Apr 5, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great SINGLE player game. The game was HEAVILY advertised as a multiplayer game for the whole family which isn’t the case. One player picks the island, names the island, and overall has the better experience. But I don’t understand the harsh feedback. This game’s “island sharing functionality” isn’t any different from previous titles in the franchise. I understand the frustration but I don’t understand why it’s being review bombed for this reason alone."
MenntesMint,"Apr 5, 2020",0,"My brother received this game for his birthday and we were both super excited to have our islands but after he made his island we realized that it was only 1 island per switch, this is such a stupid, dumb, idiotic rule. Now my brother is the only one who can play the game and I'm stuck not being able to play. WOULD NOT BUY FOR MULTIPLE PEOPLE!"
jdsharbs,"Apr 5, 2020",0,This game has caused lots of heartache for my kids. The fact that you can only do one island per console is a terrible thing to do to children. Each wanted to make their own island and visit each other's island. But greedy stupid Nintendo really screwed this game up.
Facellama,"Apr 5, 2020",4,The game is great apart from a massive design flaw of not allowing multiple islands. This would be a 9 or 10 with this feature. This is literally tearing the community apart and should be available. Needing to buy a NEW CONSOLE to have another island is beyond the reach of 90% of players and families. Whoever thought that this would just work most likely doesn't have children as each would like to have their own island and own experience of the game. This should be a call to the devs to make this change as soon as they possibly can with the virus taken into account.
OrkidOG,"Apr 5, 2020",2,"I love this game. Love it.. but as previously stated by hundreds of people, not being the main island representative ****. When you go on the Nintendo support page, they just state that another Switch needs to be purchased for someone to have their own island. I don’t know about everyone else, but right now, especially during this period of quarantine, I don’t have a damn dime to spare. I don’t have cash to just throw at another Switch. For us new AC players, this has been a major wake up call. So frustrating."
TruthOfChad,"Apr 5, 2020",0,I was spinning my wheels upgrading my house and waiting for the main story elements like upgrading island. Eventually i learned that the band developers block  all except the main switch account from making progress in the game.  I bought ghf game and basically it completely **** and has no story backbone because the creators decided to block 2ndary accounts.
Prettyheavy,"Apr 5, 2020",5,The one island per console system has spoiled an otherwise fantastic game for my family.
Superfantastic,"Apr 5, 2020",0,"The inability to have different islands in multiple save files fundamentally breaks what would otherwise be an amazing game. Absolutely terrible for families, a stupid marketing decision for such a family friendly game."
poopyy,"Apr 5, 2020",5,"My issue with the game is that the controls are overly sensitive in that if you’re one pixel off the fish won’t see the line and if you are digging a hole or wanting to plant something the odds of it being where you want is about 40%. It’s also too easy to undo something that you wanted because the controls are so sensitive/picky. If you had an update with the options of simpler controls and interactions similar to Pocket Camp, the game would be much more relaxing and enjoyable. The other issue is the mystery island AI, there should be a quiz or something at the beginning of the game that is focused on which villager type or style you like because I (and probably many others) have wasted over 20 Nook Miles Tickets and over 40,000 Nook Miles trying to find the villager I want or at least a decent villager to invite. Or the least you could do is make Nook Miles tickets cheaper, or have them be purchasable with bells, because at a certain point it’s hard to get enough Nook Miles. Or there at least has to be a way to invite a villager other than buying an amiibo card. It frustrated me so much that I just reset and deleted the game and it will probably take me 2 more weeks of quarantine to be bored enough to try again."

TimWade,"Apr 5, 2020",0,"First time i play animal crossing. I let my sister create the island. She played for a day or two. Now she doesn't want to play anymore. I have been playing for 10 days and i was wondering why i only got the museum.
Truns out the second players can't progress the main story, or decide in any island related issue (new resident, new tools, bridge, new building etc).
i am left with three options:
- Delete main player and restart the island (35h juste for me)
- Force her to play
- Get on her character every day to upgrade main/house story, do resident management, etc
Such a wast of time."
Tee_Jay,"Apr 5, 2020",0,One island per Switch is insane. You guys at Nintendo sure know how to come up with good ideas and totally ruin them. Won't touch this game again unless you can have more than one island per Switch.
RydesaurusRex,"Apr 5, 2020",0,"This is one of the worst games i have ever played.  Not only that, but Nintendo's no refund policy should be illegal.  I will never buy another Nintendo game again.  Knew getting a Switch was a mistake.  Ridiculous."
Sinews,"Apr 5, 2020",5,"The main issue people will direct at this game is the ""same-console multiplayer"" debacle. It isn't a huge issue in my eyes, it's not exactly like offering multiple saves was a series tradition or anything. To me, the main issue plaguing Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the endless tedium and monotonous gameplay that gets excused by the series ""take it easy, relax, no pressure"" conceit. Well, I'd like to relax, but the inordinate time spent between menus, the minuscule inventory, and the lack of meaningful improvements over previous entries is getting in the way."
Roccovite,"Apr 5, 2020",0,Absolutely unforgivable! Bought this game with my sister and She played for first and now i am a little more than an NPC! I want to play the full game! Embarassing in 2020 something like that!
tombrgmn,"Apr 5, 2020",0,"Been working hard this whole week with my fiance asking me constantly about when am I going to start my island. I finally found time to sit down and do it. Well, too bad. Apparently I can't, because of Nintendo greed. She had made her island first and neither of us realized that her making the island first would screw over my own ability to make an island. This along with the whole coronavirus quarantine lockdown and Nintendo's shortage on Switch consoles makes this whole thing an even harder pill to swallow. I guess I just won't be playing this one, Nintendo. Thanks for the betrayal Nintendo, didn't expect it to come from you, but I don't get fooled again."
dzibilchalton,"Apr 5, 2020",2,"Why cant we batch craft? Why can't crafting pull from resources in storage? How come Mable can place clothing I bought into storage for me when /I/ don't even have that ability? Why can't we select multiple items to buy from the Tailor- instead having to purchase one at a time to leave and re-enter to buy the other colour options of a shirt I want? Why can't I select multiple items in my inventory and choose to send them all to storage? Why can I access Nook Phone while sitting but not my inventory? Why can't we sit on the ground next to villagers? Why aren't we allowed to meet villagers on mystery islands when we have full residence on Island? Why can't we choose to buy multiple of items through the terminal (It's a pain to buy a Nook Miles Ticket, wait for it to print out, choose to purchase more ONE AT A TIME.)

Why can't we move buildings over by just a tile or two?( I've had to move a house/store somewhere else completely to then move it back to it's original location, just 2 spaces to the left). Why is there NOTHING to do with friends in this game? Where are the island minigames like in New Leaf?

Why can't we ride the carnival rocking horsies like we've seen in footage leading up to the release? Why does Nook's Cranny take SO long to upgrade? (You would think a store upgrade would come before you even get the chance to have an entirely new Tailor shop take root in your island.) Why does the upgrade only include ONE extra furniture slot? Remember all the Nook store upgrades in New Leaf? wow.

I WANT TO CRAFT MULTIPLE BAIT AT A TIME! I WANT TO PLACE RUGS ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE! I WANT TABLES AND COUNTERS TO PLACE MY ITEMS ON! I WANT GOLDEN TOOLS TO NOT BREAK- OR AT LEAST LAST WAY LONGER THAN THEY DO NOW. I WANT TO  HAVE ACCESS TO ALL FURNITURE COLOUR SWATCHES/BE ABLE TO MANUALLY CUSTOMIZE THE OTHERS IF I OWN ONE.

The multiplayer in this game is so limiting. I want more furniture sets. This game could stand to be a hell of a lot more user friendly, bro."

Besides that, I just discovered certain feature that I can't have and only first player has received, which ruined this game for me, the one that buyed and proposed the game at home. Such a disappointment. You have been warned."
Nahna,"Apr 5, 2020",1,"Grande decepção. Não com o jogo, que é fantástico para entregar o que promete (apesar de não ser um estilo para todos), mas com as decisões da Nintendo para com ele.

O que você precisa saber antes de comprar:
- Somente uma ilha por console
- Não é possível fazer nada como o player 2 no coop local
- Não é possível jogar coop online mesmo que tenha 2 switch (e 1 jogo)
- Não é possível transferir o save pra outro console
- Não suporta save cloud
- Não tem ""matchmaking""

Muito limitado para um jogo dessa geração. Uma pena."

Honest-Review,"Apr 5, 2020",5,"I brought the game for me and my little 7 year old to enjoy together, I feel terrible that my promises **** we could share together were a lie. Nintendo cheated us royally on this.

But tbh I could have overlooked it had Animal crossing been a good game when it's just not.

Conversations are repeated over and over and over again every single day! Selling items takes forever! Loading screens take forever, tasks are boring and will drive you mad from the monotonous element of it. Everything is so slow, its not relaxing slow, just frustrating slow. There is no story at all! And I know it's not that sort of game, but you have to have some story... And it doesn't. I could go on and on and bore you to death like this game does to its players. Shame on Nintendo for this rubbish."
SmittyBit,"Apr 5, 2020",2,"The game seems like it could be fun, but the ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE limit is a deal breaker. Social islands are a neat idea, but shouldn't be shoved down the throat of gamers. This is my first time ever playing an Animal Crossing game, and im stuck as a resident on someone else's island with no control? No thank you.
Nintendo seems to be saying ""You don't want to experience this neat feature we came up with? Well WE think you really have to. This game is not for you."""

She prompted me to start a character first because she was busy the day we got it. And then when she went to start a character later we discovered that only one island may be played per console and that she would have to play based off my sloppy seconds. This just feels so wrong and a gross attempt to get the players to spend more money. My wife barely plays games and we were so turned off by this that we're going to return the game.  Awful representation by nintendo and a stain on their brand in my mind

megamario111,"Apr 4, 2020",10,"This is easily a contender for best Animal Crossing game. It brings everything you've loved about the series since it's beginnings, and adds even more content (with more to come). The only cons to this game are 1. a few quality of life changes they could make, as with the other games in the series, and 2. Only one island per console, which is the only reason this game has such a bad user score. This is definitely a game to pick up and sink hundreds of hours into during this time of self isolation."
Serzern,"Apr 4, 2020",0,Only one island per switch. Not even per game. Worst decision ever. My girlfriend bought the game and is therefore player one but now I have to wait for her to progress the story. I can't even buy my own copy of the game to fix this it's infuriating.
Mustaches,"Apr 4, 2020",10,"ok, i get that people are mad about not having two people playable on the switch, but don't review bomb the game!  0/10 basically means the game is unplayable. at the least please rate this game with a mixed review. through the whole series, animal crossing has restricted you to one island per console. nintendo isnt going to listen to review bombing. anyways, this game is really good! simple 10/10"
Apisto415,"Apr 4, 2020",0,Nintendo decided to force my fiancée and I to SHARE an island. We don’t need a second switch since we are adults with full time jobs and don’t play enough to warrant a second switch. Sharing an island is not the worst thing but waiting years to find this out was quite a disappointment. We have a PS4 and have separate accounts with separate save files. Why can’t Nintendo do the same!?!?

Jacklg,"Apr 4, 2020",9,"The review bombing is dumb, this is a super polished and incredibly fun game that deserves all the praise and popularity its getting"
TheTwistedKris,"Apr 4, 2020",2,"I came in as a new person to the franchise and I find myself having fun with it. The zen style of gameplay is a nice change from the usual, though I wish they put more thought into this games as the design of some aspects seem short sighted.

Most jarringly at first I noticed was the 5am gates. Any time you progress the island a step, the game will lock any further progression behind a 5am tomorrow gate. Mind you this isn't real time, as it will unlock at 5am tomorrow regardless of when you hit the gate. This makes certain buildings a chore, most notably the museum. You get gated after 5 donations to Tom then  after 15 more donations to Blathers, which is then followed by a mandatory 24h construction period. This process takes 48 to 72 hours depending on when you made the first 5 donations, which feels annoying because you need to hold onto any discoveries you find for that time.

Next is progression, which for the most part punishes you for doing so. A good example of this is buying from Timmy & Tommy. At the start of the game you can buy & sell from them freely until you get Nook's Cranny. When you do you can only buy & sell normally until 10pm, you can sell using the box at any time with it only being 80% of normal selling price. This detail annoys me so much. If the shop hours was going to be a thing, why not have it always be like that? That way it doesn't feel like they are restricting features or selling for less because you are past the time-frame. The box could have been a positive feature by letting you sell past close time, but instead it's just presented in a way that punishes the player.

The tool system isn't much different. Tools break and there are stronger versions available for the right material, but they never change the act of collecting and can actually be a downgrade if the player isn't careful. This can be seen with the iron axe, which doesn't increase the amount of wood dropped and instead will chop down a tree on the 3rd hit, preventing it from growing again and stopping you from collecting wood. There is no reason to use the iron axe over the stone one, which offers the same amount of drops without destroying the source and still offers a fair amount of hits. If you do want to move a tree, just use shovel + fruit which actually put it into your inventory to move/sell.

There are other odd details that haven't impacted me much as a solo player being the only one on my switch, but having a single island per console is really not fun since if you want to try local multiplayer you need to place additional tents down on your island to do so. Multiplayer isn't that well explained by the game in general. Overall I do like the game, but the design clashes a lot with the zen game it's trying to be.

Bunny Day Update: Oh boy I do like being able to progress even less because of eggs appearing instead of needed materials. This game already has too much rng."
PneumaticLime,"Apr 4, 2020",0,"Don’t buy unless you will be the only regular player. One person gets to experience the game and anyone after the first has to be a pointless player in the originals island. You can’t contribute anything. I bought it and was the first player, but my brother went in to play later and when we realized this I had him delete my island so he could play. I don’t really plan on touching it because that was super frustrating to happen and it seems entirely pointless for the developer to have done. Maybe if they fix it I’ll create my own island but for now I don’t even really have a game I payed $60 for."

Basically all you can do is chop wood and stone to give to the main character so that when they decide to play, they can turn them in to upgrade the town......
I CANT EVEN SEE WHAT THEY NEED!!!! They have to verbally tell me!!!!!

Fix this ASAP!!"
VvNeo2000vV,"Apr 4, 2020",0,"Same as what everyone else is saying! 1 console 1 island, ridiculous.  What a transparent attempt at Nintendo trying to **** people into buying more switch consoles.  Probably because the switch lite bombed so badly they are trying to get people to buy them.  It’s ridiculous that at least make each paid online service account make their own island.  One per $300 dollar console is just unforgivable.  Me and my 2 daughter want to make our own islands, but no that will cost us an additional $720 dollars is Nintendo out of their f’n minds? Whoever designed this game should be fired."
rayannlin,"Apr 4, 2020",1,"Very disappointed in the game play of this for people sharing the switch. It is unreal to expect people to purchase multiple switch consoles in order to have the same experience. To be clear, I am fine with sharing an island. That's the way it's always been. What's ridiculous is the lack of abilities that the non-resident representatives have to deal with. It wouldn't have been difficult to allow all players to terraform, build bridges, etc. And to progress the story. If they wanted to make people share they should have made everyone able to experience the full game. Honestly not worth the money for families hoping to play together"
fierysonic,"Apr 4, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is the greatest game in the series. First off, having one island per switch isn’t too big of a deal. If you feel that this is a major problem. You are sorely mistaken. This game has so many improvements that make it impossible for me to go back to an older version. The biggest of the improvements are as follows: Terraforming, full control over placement of buildings, character customization, local play, even more custom designs and placement of said designs. First, Terraforming gives so much freedom to make your island really yours. And placing the buildings wherever you please just adds to this freedom. Character customization makes your character really feel like you, and allows a whole lot of expression. Local play is new to the series and is decent. Probably the worst new component to the game just because of how it is implemented. And finally custom designs. Custom designs makes it really easy for anyone to create amazing looking clothing and pictures. And you can place them anywhere. Overall, an amazing game. And the pros out weigh the cons by an exponential amount. Really, you should buy this game."
HHnick3001,"Apr 4, 2020",2,Only the first player can do projects and participate actively in the island the rest of local players are like guests in the game.
ItsfullofDave,"Apr 4, 2020",1,"Bought this game for two young kids to play, only to find out too late that they have to share the same island. Perhaps Nintendo have never met siblings who are not great at sharing. Perhaps they think all sisters get along all the time and never get angry with the other for TOUCHING THEIR STUFF. It would be lovely to imagine that was true. But they must have known the problems it would cause and did it anyway. So, 1 out of 10 from me for such a cynical and greedy decision"
Manntatoes,"Apr 4, 2020",0,Limiting the game to one island per Switch is a inexcusable greedy anti consumer move.
Gonicanary,"Apr 4, 2020",0,"Only the first player is the one who can keep unlocking things in the game.  secondary players can only get resources and depend on the first.  Furthermore, it does not allow you to have one island per player.  At home we were disappointed in this, since I depend on the first player, a shame."
Trevorv,"Apr 4, 2020",0,The local multiplayer on this game is so badly designed it is a hate crime. I wish I had never bought this game. Please take your game back and give me my money back Nintendo!
dcast2,"Apr 4, 2020",4,"We bought a digital copy for our Switch, because Nintendo said only one island per Switch, so we thought it would be a great game for our family of five to play together. Unfortunately, the game is unplayable because it requires one person to be the Resident Representative (witch is by default the first person to log into the game). DO NOT buy this game if you will play with more than one person. It has been a terrible experience for our family. Nintendo has been extremely deceptive in their promotion of this game as a multiplayer game. It is a single player game PERIOD! Only the first person to log into the game has the ability to play the main game, all the other people cannot play the main game, they just wait to the Resident Representative to play the actual game and then the other players get do a few things. Do not buy this game is you are planning to play with your family, everyone will be frustrated and angry. I wish I could return the game to the store or sell my copy, but unfortunately I bought it digitally. I expected better from Nintendo. I want to give this game a 9 for it's content, but at the present time, without an update to the local multiplayer sharing, it's a 4.5."
Marauderby,"Apr 4, 2020",2,The game itself is amazing but the fact that only one island is allowed per switch ruins the game for me.
cbartondock,"Apr 4, 2020",0,"A master class in corporate greed - this isn't a game so much as the visual manifestation of a spreadsheet. You can't have multiple islands per console, hence there can only be one player who gets to do the ""story missions"" from Nook. Your online account is linked to the animal crossing user rather than to the switch user, so you can't have someone visit your island unless you are playing as the person who has an online account or unless you pay for multiple online accounts. Truly jaw droppingly anti consumer. Do yourself a favor and skip this wretch."
LighteningA,"Apr 4, 2020",0,If you have kids you have to purchase another switch as you can only have one island making your 2nd on the game loosingnout in progressing and is more or less obsolete
sanctuary,"Apr 4, 2020",1,"Only _one_ save file (island) per switch.
Only the *first* player gets any real control over the island. Selecting where buildings go, terraforming, etc.
Any other players basically get to watch player one play the game.
Feels like it was pushed out early and more will be added in ""updates.""
Nintendo has ruined what would have been an amazing experience for people to enjoy together. Unless you intend to play this game alone, I suggest avoiding it.
The saddest part is, a ton of negativity would go away if they removed the one island restriction."
foolishren,"Apr 4, 2020",9,Just like every Animal Crossing game this is chill fun game. I play it about a hour a day or longer if I'm playing with friends. It lets you pretty much place furniture anywhere so you can really make the island your own.
emily_jen2002,"Apr 4, 2020",10,"Fantastic game if you play on your own Switch.  Slow start, but then is flawless."
Smokez45,"Apr 4, 2020",5,"My GF and I are both huge AC fans. However, only one of us is able to enjoy the game. Anybody after the first resident gets a half baked experience. Multiplayer has too many limitations to enjoy regularly.  Currently we can afford another copy and I'd gladly buy one. However, we can't afford another Switch and with COVID-19 it'll be awhile before we can responsibly afford it. I don't understand Nintendo's decision to have one island per Switch and not per game or profile. It is seen as a family entertainment system and AC cannot entertain a family at the moment. One person per Switch can truly experience the game and that is not okay. Also, there is no reason not to offer cloud back ups. The Switch is a home and portable console. Being portable adds risks. Nobody should have to feel the heartache of losing their console and their hours of hard work. The game is awesome and I will gladly raise my score once Nintendo gets with modern times and fixes these archaic limitations."
Saint962,"Apr 4, 2020",0,"PEOPLE, CALL/REPORT/SUBMIT FEEDBACK TO NINTENDO IF YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGES, NOT JUST HERE.
My addition to reviews regarding one island limitations."
Aslime,"Apr 4, 2020",0,"My wife and I were looking forward to playing this game when it released. I bought it, I let her play first she made an island and played for a bit. Then I decided to play only to discover that Nintendo only allows one island per switch! Not only that, the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do. So, if you have more than one person in your home that wants to play the game, you need two switches. Worst decision I have ever seen, this even beats EA.
Congratulations Nintendo, you have officially become the worst video game company this year!"
Mmry,"Apr 4, 2020",0,"One machine only can build one island.
How desperately theses guys want to earn money?"
rooted,"Apr 4, 2020",1,If you own this game and a Switch just for yourself you will probably like this game very much.  But if you share a console with someone (a family member or your girl/boyfriend) it will undoubtedly end with an arguments and anger. I can't even imagine having two children and one console. I will recommend this game only if Nintendo fix this no. of players limitation.
Taorob,"Apr 4, 2020",5,"Surely madness!!

I went to buy 2 copies of Animal Crossing today and thankfully the store attendant said ‘You do know you can only have 1 island per Switch’ I’m hazarding a guess they may have had few games returned already!
I said that’s fine I have 2 switches because I have 3 children and we like to cross play on games. Then it dawned on me. I could create an island for me on my switch but who would get to create their island on the other Switch?
Draw lots? Choose a favourite child?!

Anyway the only choice I was left with was to return both the games as it really would have caused big arguments.

So from us that has been a big fail regarding sales and I am not being bitter in saying I hope this doesn’t work out for them and they patch it. It certainly feels like a horrendously corporate, commercial piece of programming. Unless there is sensible reasoning behind it but with expandable memory on the Switch I can’t see what.

It may be worth mentioning this fact as I feel it could be a deal breaker for many families considering buying the game."
larfenix,"Apr 4, 2020",5,"El juego sigue siendo lo de siempre han cambiado algo aquí algo allá, ha perdido cosas esenciales por el camino, el hecho de que las herramientas se estén rompiendo a cada rato es un encordio, y el sistema de Islas aleatorias es penoso. Entiendo que las mejores islas como la isla de las tarantulas no salgan a menudo pero que de 30 veces que he ido de viaje las 30 me haya salido una isla random con la misma fruta y las mismas flores, eso es penoso y está mal hecho te dan ganas de dejar de jugar"
Extrevious,"Apr 4, 2020",1,"Nintendo has made an interesting marketing decision for a supposed family company and directly put families in the ditch with how they’ve decided to manage the saves in the game. They have decided that there can only be one island per SWITCH not per account which confuses me as a player since every other switch title (Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Breath of the Wild, **** Valley, Super Smash Bros Ult. and Mario Kart) all extremely popular titles and games that have brought the switch up to level with PlayStation and Xbox and they all have SEPERATE saves. I genuinely don’t understand a player focused decision other than they want to make as much money as possible off of players. Please Nintendo, fix this for the people who love the game but also want to play it with their family members and even friends because I don’t want myself or them to be forced to delete their save so that another person can experience the full game."
TylerReid,"Apr 3, 2020",10,"The game itself was so fun. The different missions are easy, yet leave you enough room to learn. I enjoyed this game and I’m enjoying adding to my DIY list, with over 250 items on it!!"
bruhbruhbruh2,"Apr 3, 2020",0,Multiplayer system is **** Literally no clue who thought this design choice was something players would enjoy. It literally strips all fun for anybody but the first one who logged in. So **** dumb.
Zylir,"Apr 3, 2020",5,"There's a few issues I have with this game. The lack of online interactive related things and unnecessary long transitions when people leave your island, the fact that there's only a ""Real time"" option, and that there's no way in game to advertise your island. I'd love a brochure to ""sell"" your island, tell people you have certain things there and be more social with it by showing it off maybe and saying stuff like ""Hey, I have a tarantula island, come on by!"" Create more of a city, involve more on your island. I just feel it's so limited for not really a good reason but to be a cop out. I'd love more interaction with the citizens and events with them. Everything seems so bare bones for a $60 game.

I'd also enjoy it if you had sort've a function to treat it like **** valley where it had it's own hastened day/night cycle to an extent. I'd like to at least play the game in a few weeks, enjoy all there is to see  and catch/do quests for everyone in that time frame. It's just not there, just nooks increasing debt with everything you do. I get that ""animal crossing may just not be for me"" however, I don't think a lot of what I said are bad idea's nor would make people dislike the game any.  Do people really enjoy the game mostly being played only an hour or so at a time and all these things that you probably wont ever get done because you may not be playing in the September time frame to catch certain things?

The last thing is the most obvious though. Not sharing your island. Me and my gf share the switch because I barely play Nintendo games and so she somewhat does, so very little reason to own two. People telling others ""Why not just own 2 switches! stop being poor!"" why should we be punished for their poor design choice? Such a weird thing to defend a company on."
AnalogousPants5,"Apr 3, 2020",9,"I am the only person playing on my Switch, so the primary issues related to multiple saves for multiple people on the same console has not affected me. These complaints are valid, but I can only speak honestly to my own experiences with this game.

This is the perfect game to come out at the perfect time in the era of COVID-19. My daily routine now incorporates Animal Crossing  New Horizons. It would certainly be a good game if it came out at any other time, but here and now it provides a much needed routine and sense of comfort."
Gdragon521,"Apr 3, 2020",10,"This is the best game in the Animal Crossing series. I would actually give it a 9/10, because it isn't perfect, but I need to balance out all these negative reviews."
Stupidboy0831,"Apr 3, 2020",2,At first I was having some fun but a little bored that’s because when I saw what the first player to log in can do I was disappointed this game is designed for families with multiple children interested in the game but have 1 switch it’s main purpose is for you to buy a whole new switch so everyone can experience the game fully.
david1234,"Apr 3, 2020",0,"Can't share Animal Crossing to family members to create their own island. Rather, they're treated as your employees and the only purpose is to gather and provide resources. So you have to buy a second switch and switch online to make playing animal crossing with family members possible. Almost as bad sellout as Sony indefinitely postponing Last of Us 2 because of the pandemic. It's almost like digital games never event existed! Also, Animal Crossing is super boring. All you do is collect fishes and bugs, I actually thought it was like Farmville where you plant and harvest crops/veges under certain time periods to grow your island. Can't even get a refund cause EB Games is closed till the pandemic is over!"
KikiF,"Apr 3, 2020",0,Secondary player can’t do much. This is insane considering nintendo switch isn’t considered as a handheld-only console. There’s no way to get another island except buying another switch which costs a lot of money that i’d never want to spend on
b669,"Apr 3, 2020",0,The fact you can't have multiple islands is just ridiculous and seems like a scheme to sell more switch consoles.
Khalvarun,"Apr 3, 2020",2,The games is fun in the beginning but gets boring very quickly. I was very hyped about the game coming out but it has way many shortcomings and glitches. The Easter event going on right now is the nightmare you would be living through!
WhimsicalPhares,"Apr 3, 2020",2,This would be a great game if not for the one island limit per console. I created my account second and I'm tired of being treated like a second class citizen. You have 0 power as player two and the island is way too small for multiple people. Nintendo needs to stop being greedy and fix this. Don't buy unless you have the entire console to yourself.
thomnash,"Apr 3, 2020",0,"Amazing game. It's super addictive, can't wait to give it a 10/10 when they change the 1 island per switch feature."
MalCey,"Apr 3, 2020",3,"I’m not affected by the multiplayer issue, I just dislike the game. Major annoyances are the UI, very slow and annoying load times on things like selling items, entering areas. The load times are terrible. The puns get really old fast and hold up things like selling things or advancing the story.

Gameplay is repetitive and gets old real quick. It’s just a very boring game. I’ve played for a week and it’s time for me to sell this game on for sure.

I’m sure the score would be even less if I had to play this in a house with two players.

I really do not recommend purchasing this game or a switch which has a really low selection of games at a premium price. PC or PS4 are far better value for money. Very disappointed with Nintendo this generation and I’m not very aware of the bias of fans."
oliverpette,"Apr 3, 2020",9,The perfect game to these times. It ia relaxing and social challenge with many Things to do
Vallam13,"Apr 3, 2020",0,haha how on Earth did they end up restricting it to one island per CONSOLE? Did they only let rich people playtest the game? Did they forget that real humans don't have access to infinite Switches? Absolutely surreal incompetence and the most Nintendo thing I've ever seen. They consistently manage to make the best games out there and then run then under terrible UI and restrictive design choices.
TylerKai,"Apr 3, 2020",0,I big old **** you to whoever decided I had to share in island with my brother. Unplayable.
frequentlyfreck,"Apr 3, 2020",0,Wonderful game but LET PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH. Pretty ridiculous this wasn't in the game at launch.
MC_Zocker2004,"Apr 3, 2020",4,"I hate how you can only have 1 island per switch.  I got it for my birthday and player about 3 days,  when my little brother wanted to play it he could only play on my island andand could not build anything. You dissapointed a 9-year old child,  Nintendo."
fozie,"Apr 3, 2020",2,"I've played every Animal Crossing game as they were released, and was ecstatic for New Horizons. The game is beautiful, and you can tell that a lot of work went into the visuals and scenery. Aside from that, I feel like it's lacking even compared to its older predecessors. I was hoping for a greater variety of dialogue with villagers, but interactions are very limited and repetitive. The villagers are the staple of Animal Crossing. I was so excited to finally have a game that would have rich, personable interaction, more villager games, etc. Villagers used to host flea markets and visit your house for fun or vice versa. They used to have interactive aerobics and sports fairs. Now they just wander around and do their own thing, but your character doesn't even have the ability to sit down or join them. I can already predict the 3-5 dialogue options I'll hear each day from every villager. It's disappointing. The lack of amenities is also frustrating. When previous games like City Folk and New Leaf had coffee shops, theaters, and other stores, we were expecting more - not expecting everything to be taken away. Now that I've paved and decorated my town, there really isn't anything to do. I can see that they added the Nook Miles system as a way to keep you busy but most of us aren't interested in doing menial tasks for numbers, we wanted more room for interaction with our villagers and island. Once everyone has played for a month or so, they'll be finding that there really isn't anything to do in this game. Unfortunately I'm probably going to end up putting this game down and picking up Wild World or New Leaf unless some updates roll out to change things."
The_Argo,"Apr 3, 2020",0,"No spoilers here, have hardly played the game for one reason. You can only have one island per Switch so if someone else starts the game first it is their island and you can only do so much. Made me stop playing after an hour."
Nintenboy,"Apr 3, 2020",10,The game is amazing! Everyone rating the game a 0-4 because they can’t have multiple users isn’t fair! Get off here! And cry somewhere else. What’s the big deal? This was explained before the game was released so why did you buy it? You just wanna whine. Simple solution buy a switch lite for family member or get gone. The game is unbelievable good and adorable!
iMustang,"Apr 3, 2020",10,"This was my first time diving into this cherished franchise and I must say all my hype and excitement was very much matched. The atmosphere of this game feels exactly like a vacation, a place you can get away and enjoy life however you want. Catching fish, planting flowers, visiting new places, a museum, and shopping, all while meeting adorable animal friends along the way. The sheer amount of stuff you can do in this game is insane, to a point that a completionist like me wonders if you can really do it all, not that it'll stop me from trying! Then the social element with friends makes the experience even better, as the communication with hunting bugs and fish, different stuff to craft, or even the ""stalk market"" all make you feel like you're apart of something larger as a whole (even lager than the feeling of your own island community gives you). That's exactly the feeling the developers want you to have with this franchise, and it certainly resonates within each and every one of us. And even simplified, visiting islands and showing off your own is just fun! (So long as everyone plays nice)

This was a time in my life when this game was exactly needed, and has brought me so much joy and peace. I know I'll be playing this game for months and years to come, and even when the next Animal Crossing game comes out, New Horizons will always hold a special place in my heart for being my entry into this beautiful series."
Tospond,"Apr 3, 2020",10,I love this game! Every day i play his and i am trying to get 2 of my hated vilagers out! I can terraform and make the perfect island! I can breed flowers are much more! This game is a must have!
Gregoryfricker,"Apr 3, 2020",1,"The game advertises multiplayer with a catch, the first player to play the game is the only player who can progress in the game. Every other player (your kids you bought the game for), are stuck. This is true even if you buy more copies of the game. This in itself doesn’t merit the negative review. The worst offense is the company’s response to thousands of fans. I’m not going to buy games from a company who can fix a problem but tells everyone to eat it by refusing to address the matter at all."
metalliham,"Apr 3, 2020",0,Only one island per switch is stupid. I have multiple family members and will not buy an extra Switch. Disgusting money grab.
Farkus,"Apr 3, 2020",9,"I haven't played since Animal Crossing for the Gamecube so I am not certain, how much of this content is new to this game, but I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  There is a lot to do, and the gameplay loop is quite satisfying.  There is one major issue I have with this game though that prevents it from getting a perfect score, and that is equipment breaking.  Its really annoying and even the golden tools can break.  That turns what was the ultimate reward in AC for the Gamecube, to a waste of resources in ACNH, and its a real bummer.  Additionally, multiplayer feels restrictive, why cant best friends place and move furniture when playing online?  I trust them, that's why they are best friends."

wanderi,"Apr 3, 2020",0,"You can only have one island per SWITCH. All accounts on one switch must share one island, and so the first player is the only one getting the full experience.

Diegocosta12,"Apr 3, 2020",0,Only one island per switch..... seriusly nintendo??? We need a update soon....
darxiv,"Apr 3, 2020",4,"I have had to rewrite my review. I expected more content for player 2 after the first week and upgrading  buildings. Sadly this game is only meant for 1 player. If you are not the citizen representative then you are playing a very shallow game. Everything you can do is nothing compared to the first person on the island.

Very frustrating experience since there are some great improvements to other parts of the game."
Fyle,"Apr 3, 2020",0,"Incredible to see that you can't have more than one island. I bought this for my wife, my daughter and me. My wife began to play first, as you know, my daughter and me are unable to create our own island. Incredible to see this, Nintendo advertised their switch as a family friendly console. Seeing as this move goes in the COMPLETE opposite direction, it is just unforgivable. I would understand this for a specific solo game, but we're taking about animal crossing... Since my daughter really wanted to play the game throughfully, my wife had to just forget about the game and leave it to her. She played nearly every animal crossing games until now."
lcb3,"Apr 3, 2020",7,"Overall, I think this is a decent title and I would have rated it higher except for the problems with multiple accounts playing on a single switch.  The primary user (my wife in my case) can get certain objectives but I can help by gathering the resources she needs to complete them quickly.  Other that that, I haven't run into any real negatives in playing (although I find the new ""Bunny"" stuff rather annoying).  Overall I've had fun playing together as well as individually."
ThorTheEpic,"Apr 3, 2020",3,"If you're player 1, this is a fun continuation of the Animal Crossing series. It keeps a lot of core mechanics such as fishing, weeding, bug catching, etc., and adds an interesting crafting mechanic. You get to build up your island with amenities and help new animal neighbors move in. However, if you're not the first player (island representative), your gameplay will be limited. You can't help with moving in new villagers or getting shops up and running. You're arbitrarily restricted from parts of the game. You don't get access to crafting recipes or tools you need until player one passes certain milestones. Some recipes are only ever given to player one. And there's no way to have access to the whole game as player two. You have to buy a whole new console (yes, console, not game.) If you're the only person who uses your Switch or nobody else will ever want to play Animal Crossing on it, it's an excellent game. But expect any secondary players to be locked out of some of the game and disappointed."
sevenseven,"Apr 3, 2020",9,"Would be 10/10, but they don't let you have multiple islands. If you buy another game on a separate profile you should be able to have a second island. So, instead you have to buy another switch to have more than one island which is stupid.
(I am the only one playing this game in my family) Game play has been great. Typical animal crossing do nothing all day in real life while doing a lot in game. Enjoying the new egg hunt too."
srijansin91,"Apr 3, 2020",8,"It is so incredibly relaxing compared to many games but it is not without flaws. Its simplicity can also cause understandable polarisation in reviews. If 'impatient', 'action-hungry' or 'likes-to-skip-cutscenes' describes you at all, you will not enjoy this game. At times the dialogue and real-time day progression system will test you but giving it a chance and taking it slow will yield undeniably cute moments worth your waiting. If you plan to play more than one person per switch drop this review score by 3 points (I never liked Nintendo's insistence on having ten consoles and copies of the game for per gaming family)"
Thomas1112097,"Apr 3, 2020",0,The one island per switch thing is the most stupid and scammy thing ever. i just want to play the game without ruining it for my family.
Naroyto,"Apr 3, 2020",0,"Where do I begin, no this isn't your regular blind rant of someone complaining about, one switch one island. I'm here to educate you why I chose to give this sorry installment they would like to call New horizons this score. Allow me to elaborate first and foremost this is an excellent single player game. To call it multiplayer would mean you have some sort of undying fanboy inside you telling you that it is. After many iteration this latest installment offers NOTHING and I mean ZERO new concepts, ideas or features involving multiplayer game play. That is what makes this such a lackluster game. I mean you go to a town and then what? Nothing absolutely nothing especially those posh elites thinking that you must do nothing to change a town or even run because it wears out the grass. Why have them over then? To show off your island that was obtained obviously by means of time travel and you have the audacity to set rules on your throne of lies? Seriously if you time travel you are only cheating yourself of the true experience of the game which is to grind and work hard for your accomplishments and should think twice about posting your ""perfect"" town for fake internet points. With nothing to penalize time traveler they just ruin the point of the game and finish it within a week. This game offers nothing new compared to the older games in fact the museum received an overhaul on its interior yet there is less to fill it with. Yes that's right because there are no paintings and no deep sea creatures to turn in.

Another thing about that. There is still no new additions to the bug, fish and fossils list and that's shameful just going to find the same ones over again with nothing new to find.

The crafting system was the most exciting thing I wanted. Until the gimic ran out faster than starting tools could last. Seriously it became more of a chore than a fun feature. There's no insensitive to get better gear if the cheapest one does the same job as a golden version of the tool. And on that note how about you explain why golden tools break? They are not supposed to break they are a symbol of one's accomplishments to obtain them and should not be reduced to the games gimic.

Don't get me started with the island tour nonsense. And I paraphrase ""each island you go to will never be the same as the last so make sure you do everything you can before you leave because we won't be coming back ever"" yet, there are countless times I've visited the island with the same layout and same island shape and nothing in them. Way to bait and switch the experience of visiting 5 islands on end with slight differences.

I'm glad that the events are stowed away so people can't just time travel to get everything off season that's right I'm talking to you time travelers, you're no better than businesses selling their Christmas stuff in August. Boy how hypothetical you all must be.

Worst part is that they made a conscious decision to push the game release date further down the to ensure quality yet there is so many bugs in the game especially game breaking. You can lose your save file for popping a balloon in the sky. Yup every time you do that you risk data loss. Tell me again why was the game pushed back? If that was the  choice why wasn't time spent to better multiplayer features. To summarize the game is great single player, terrible multiplayer and so much content is missing the game is bare bones and I'm not talking about holiday things I'm talking about what to do in game. There's nothing to do after an hour of play because the daily ""chores"" are completed that fast."
Gord352,"Apr 3, 2020",10,"Bought this game for my girlfriend hoping she would get really into it (especially during isolation). She hasn't really taken to it yet so I've launched it on my Switch and am on my way to customising my own Island which i'm finding a lot of fun. This is my first ever experience of an Animal Crossing game and I think the perfect place to start as you go from barren unpopulated island to building a full community - I've never been into games like this but it is really addictive!

Note: I'm fortunate in that I have my own original Switch and my girlfriend has the Switch Lite so the 1 island per console rule isn't hindering either of us. I hope for the rest of the people review bombing here that Nintendo do update it to 1 island per user because that is understandably very annoying!"
Kaito34,"Apr 3, 2020",8,"""I can't read and/or am uninformed, better review-bomb a game and give it a 0, regardless of actual experience with gameplay"" -average ACNH reviewer.

To get this out of the way: Yes, one island per device is frustrating, but we knew this and this has been the case for every animal crossing game. This information was announced by Nintendo, has been covered in the media and is explicitly mentioned in the Nintendo E-shop and on the box for physical copies. Review-bombing a game out of ignorance is rather pathetic and it's sad to see such an extremely misleading user score, which hardly reflects the game, merely the frustration of angry fans that didn't bother to read or inform themselves.

As for the actual game, it's hardly a secret at this point that it's a stellar game. Arguably one of the best life simulators and in terms of visuals, gameplay and overall feel, absolutely an upgrade over older games. It's a fantastic experience, a perfect game to just relax with and, unless you're a so-called ""time traveler"", a game that will last you for years to come due to absolute tons of customization and options not present in earlier titles.

However, not all is perfect and there are a few points of critique I have, mostly when comparing to older games, most of which boil down to missing content. Nintendo's approach to this game is to periodically add updates including new content, which is exciting, but creates uncertainty. Stuff like swimming, the cafe, club LOL, the dream suite etc. all seem to be missing from the game and while obviously not a necessity, I believe many fans would like to see their return or at least an equivalent substitute for some of the features unlocked by some of these facilities. These may be added in future updates, seeing how datamines include placeholders for a museum cafe and even gyroids, but what else will be added remains to be seen.

In general, the game is absolutely solid and feels more accessible than ever, as well as being released during a lockdown, assuring tons of hours of fun during these boring times. Everyone can enjoy it- (as long as they each have their own Switch...) and is a top recommendation for any Switch owner. Strong 8-9 from me, depending on future content to be added."

Seriously this stupid event was for fun for an hour but now I can't catch fish and the sky is constantly full of useless eggs so I have to ignore the ballons and miss the ones that actually give you useful loot or I have to pull my slingshot out every 2 seconds to figure out if it's a useless balloon or one I actually want to go for. I can't get enough wood or stone items because half to 2/3 of them turn into those stupid flipping eggs. I can't get enough fossils for the same reason

This event has ruined my favourite parts of animal crossing.

I am no longer enjoying myself"
Jayce007,"Apr 2, 2020",0,"This game is a ridiculous cash grab by the corporate pigs named nintendo, they limit the islands to one per console! Especially in this trying time they are testing people and soon people will realize they are just using them for money! I thought nintendo was better than this, I would expect such behavior out of EA but nintendo is worse than EA because they are costing us $300 dollars minimum each for people who do not own a switch! ($300 is the price of a switch mini and a copy of new horizons.) The only way nintendo can make this up to their customers is to remove the one island per console rule and put out a formal apology. I, myself am sending nintendo a dm daily on my instagram @jaycewornick to remove the one console per island rule and I invite others to do so as well."
Saradg,"Apr 2, 2020",1,"This could have been a great game if you simply could create more than one island. My sister got the whole family hyped for this great game without realizing no one could actually take any decisions, we could just follow her lead since we weren’t the first one to play on the device. For a game that prides itself on self-discovery and the freedom to do what you want, there is very little choice. The switch was conceived with groups and families in mind. Why can’t every family member play their own way? Most people don’t have the money to just buy another switch and are now stuck having spent 80$ on a game that not everyone can enjoy the same way. Shameful."
Newusernumber5,"Apr 2, 2020",0,"Separate islands for each profile should be a given. I'm not buying another switch just to have my own island. I'm also not going to play on my kid's island because it's not my island. This limitation should be in bold print and all caps on the cover of this game so people know what they're walking into. Nintendo will do nothing to address this and as a lifelong Nintendo player it's crazy frustrating. Never looked at Metacritic in my life, but heard this is where to go to vent."
sturgie96,"Apr 2, 2020",2,"Super beautiful and wonderful game(for one person) same as many ppl, is very frustrating to spend money on a game that allows only one person per gaming console to fully enjoy and access lots of the game. Super simple fix, so hope they can lose a bit of the greed."
ConMan98,"Apr 2, 2020",10,"This is a beautiful reincarnation of the Animal Crossing Series. I'm gonna be coming back all year to make sure I fill out my museum. This game makes it incredibly simple to join up with my friends too, offering an in game texting tool so I can hit them up to visit my island if I see them on. Tools break annoyingly often though...

I will say I got my own switch and am the only player on my island. I understand the people that have been negatively impacted by the one island feature and I regret that.

As for me, I love it! 10/10"
Antey17,"Apr 2, 2020",0,"I have 2 kids that were looking forward to play and as multiple reviewers mentioned - the game is limited to one island per switch.

JBMc,"Apr 2, 2020",0,"I do not understand the decision to limit the number of islands to one on the Switch. If I want to experience the game for myself, my options are to delete my girlfriends island, or go purchase an additional Switch and re-purchase the game? I used to think EA and Blizzard were bad. First time ever purchasing Animal Crossing, and unless fixed, I can guarantee this will be my last. Do the right thing. At least Bungie and Bethesda communicated to their - rightfully - angry fan-bases when their games were broken. Unacceptable. This makes Soldier 76 Fallout look like game of the year. If you plan on playing this game with a live-in partner, don't bother. Absolute waste of money and player-2's time."
RonRocker777,"Apr 2, 2020",10,"A beautiful and very fun game. Having an island per console is fine. If you are looking for a local cooperative game, play something else, as Animal Crossing was always intended to be an individual life simulator. The cooperative it's just an extra."
itisabelle,"Apr 2, 2020",1,"Awful !

Yes , the game is beautiful. Yes, the characters are adorable. Yes, it's great to customize your character the way you want without going to the hairdresser's. Yes, it's awesome to put furnitures everywhere in your island.

But what I HATE and strongly prevents me from enjoying the game is :
- crafting permanently your tools because they always break after only a few uses : even the iron tools end up **** really quick !
- crafting items and collecting D.I.Y cards : I hate to go farming for iron, stones and especially wood !
- the tarentulas, even if, apparently, they're a really good thing because  they're worth a lot of money !
- the wasps, especially when you use an axe with trees !
- paying real life money for the online multiplayer feature !
- paying real life money to transfer patterns !
- no swimsuit !
- the Photopia island is useless !
- Finding Gulliver's circuits on the beach ? No way ! I loved his little guessing game in ""New Leaf"".
- the Easter even is really painful because those eggs often replace fish : I don't want to fish for eggs, but for fish !

I love ""New Leaf"" with all my heart, but I hate ""New Horizons"". I seriously think I'm gonna sell it back.

Maybe I'm not an Animal Crossing fan after all..."
dreamyraynbo,"Apr 2, 2020",0,"The fact that only one player per console can have their own island or any kind of control over the progression of the island is absolutely ridiculous. I am absolutely boggling that any company thought that would be acceptable to players. If I thought I stood a chance at getting a refund for a $60 game that only one of us can play, I would try."
Inferno117,"Apr 2, 2020",2,I bought this game to play with my wife. I let her make the island and her profile first. Not knowing this would virtually make the game unplayable for me. You can only have one Island on the console. But for me that was not the Maine issue as I wanted to share an island with my wife anyway. But letting her crew the island left me unable to advance the game in any way. I would really like a patch set allows a toggle switch or something that would allow other players to make advancement on the island as well. Basically to get anything out of the game now I would have to buy a second switch and another copy of the game
Florian_1981,"Apr 2, 2020",0,"This game is NOT a family game, because Nintendo CHOOSE to limit to 1 island by Switch !
So, if you don't have 1 Switch and 1 game for each people in your house that want to play ACNH : YOU CAN'T !!! Because, ONLY the first player that run the game could make the island progression ! The other players are just there to help collecting resources, as if they were servants...
The angry point is that Nintendo says u can play with 3 players in local multiplayer but it's FAKE ! It's not really a multiplayer game !
You can't even have splitter screen, so you must stay near the LEADER player.
I'm very disappointed, I couldn't afford, and I don't want to, buy 3 more Switch and 3 more games to play with my Wife and my daughters !"
ToiletCobra,"Apr 2, 2020",2,"I played the original AC to death on my Gamecube back in the day, so I should be the ideal player for this game. But while I've grown this game's shallow formula sure hasn't.

The co-op is medieval and the multiplayer in general is set up in atrocious fashion. But my main complaint is just that this game really brings nothing over 2012's New Leaf and in fact seems like a step back in places (tool durability? Really, Reggie?). Animal Crossing is a game that has a small amount of quality content parceled out each day, much like a mobile game, which then quickly tapers off to painful grinding. That was okay when I was playing New Leaf on my 3DS on the train or wherever, because I had a few minutes to do meaningful content each day while waiting on other stuff, but as a sit-down console game it's just a waste of time and attention.

Even worse in my eyes is how awfully stingy the game is and how strictly it dictates the fun you are allowed to have and when you're allowed to have it. It's like playing a boardgame with a spoiled child who wants to tell you what to do on your own turns. You're constantly being told where to go, which NPC to listen to, what to look at, what your goals should be (regardless of whether you care at all), and then when you're finally let loose it's with a monumental financial yoke around your neck.

Honestly this game feels like a huge load. If you've managed to resist the hype please do give it a pass unless Nintendo eventually does some kind of update to fix things (though don't expect the slog to change, that's here to stay). I'm giving it two points because they certainly made an Animal Crossing game, and this would've been hot **** in 2001, but I don't think I'll pick it up again. Which is too bad, because as the Island Dictator, my absentee character will absolutely kneecap the progress my roommate is allowed to make. Great stuff, Nintendo."

Tandem,"Apr 2, 2020",5,"Great game for a single person using a single Switch console. However, other users on the same console are extremely handicapped. Additional console users cannot further the story and advance the island. It requires the primary user to do all of that alone.

Traxpoge02,"Apr 2, 2020",3,"Why WHY WHYYYY Nintendo!? These are some of the worse design choices for coop I've ever seen. Lets start with local coop issues, ONE shared island for every account on the Switch, No shared progress (Everything is done for player 1 only....recipes, island progression everything) PAINFULLY long collecting animation for local players collecting ANYTHING, NO INVENTORY for player 2 (every single item collected by player 2 goes to recycling bin), No ability to design anything for player 2. Just an absolute joke. Ok...lets say your a **** like me and went out and bought your gf an ENTIRE 2nd NINTENDO SWITCH JUST TO ENJOY THE GAME. I can't say the online coop is any better. Wanna trade things into Blathers when you have a coop player? CAN'T Wanna visit another island with your friends? CAN'T DO IT! Outdoor customization with your guest? Nah can't do it. This isn't a review bombing. This is a legitimate cry for nintendo to get with the f***ing times. Its 2020 and the only way for me to invite my gf to a game is to setup a four digit code and give her the code. WHY CAN'T I JUST SEND HER A GAME INVITE LIKE EVERY OTHER CONSOLE NINTENDO!? Stop your stupid close minded game development and make something with full features considering your games are always locked at 60 bucks for years for garbage feature incomplete games like this REGULARLY. No one wants to talk about how the 4 ""dungeons"" in Breath of The Wild are basically the same ""manipulate this things position to solve problems"". This company is a shell of its formal self, where they leverage their brand recognition and colorful beutiful art design to shove garbage software down our throats desperate to play something as magical as the games we grew up on. DON'T support them anymore unless they get with the times."
freika,"Apr 2, 2020",0,"I've never really been into games, but the last days I've spent most of my time enjoying animal crossing. My boyfriend wanted to introduce me to games and offered to buy this one on his switch. He set up the island, and i became 2nd resident. It was really disappointing when I realised that the reason I didn't make any progress was because my boyfriend was the island resident representative. Super greedy of Nintendo to expect people to buy not only another copy of the game, but also a new switch, to fully enjoy the game. All my joy for this game has been **** out because of this experience."

You're totally incapable of advancing the storyline and are left to just collect resources for the #1 player. In fact, several important recipes are also unavailable to you as a secondary player. It's just insane that Nintendo thought this was an OK mechanic to have in this game, and it really ruins an otherwise wonderful game."

Irishmike7,"Apr 2, 2020",0,"Well, I’m sure it’s a nice time if you’re player is the first one on the island. But I was the second, and I’m done with the game, as it’s a pretty lame experience. Take that into consideration if you’re looking to buy knowing that two or more in the household want to play - it can cause a lot of tension and arguments, and that’s not something to introduce to the family when it should be something that brings happiness.

I don’t think I’ll be buying another Nintendo console. I can see this game was designed to push console sales, and it’s a bit disappointing and offensive, really. They’re making some money now, but likely at the expense of potential later profits."

Honestly the crafting mechanic is a terrible addition. There was a real turning point while I was chopping my 20th tree that day; my axe broke and I saw that the requirements to make another axe meant I had to use the very wood I was collecting to make fun things. It actually just made me feel weary, I turned it off there and then and sold the game. Pretty disappointed"

sadhusband,"Apr 1, 2020",2,"Bought this game for my wife's birthday to play together and I am very disappointed we can't enjoy the game as equals. I was so excited about being able to play together on one island to collaborate and work together. However, as the second person to join I cannot contribute to building new shop or choosing their location. When playing local co-op the controls for both players is reduced, upgrades like item wheel cannot be used, opening your inventory interrupts the other player's actions, like pulling out their fishing line for no reason! The secondary player is trapped in a ""little-brother mode"" where they can't even pick up items or leave the view of the leader player. Shaking the controller to swap leaders is helpful but doesn't make up for how limited this mode is.

The game is very fun but as the second player I cannot enjoy the game fully. I hope that Nintendo will either improve local co-op by giving all switch users full island access, improving co-op controls and  adding true split screen, or worst case scrapping one island all together and giving all users their own save file.

Expecting couples to pay at minimum $560 (2 Switches, 2 game copies, 2 online subscriptions), and even more for larger families, for each person to fully be able to experience Animal Crossing and play together is just absolutely unacceptable and needs to be fixed."

Emperor_Mercy,"Apr 1, 2020",3,"I'm going to be completely honest, the game actually looks great. The graphics and gameplay are stunning from what i can tell.

However we all know that the one big thing that made me not even play the game at all, is in fact the one island per console limit. What this means is that if you have a family household Nintendo Switch, You ALL have to share 1 island, and if you want another, you have to pay another 350$ bucks. So essentially what happens is if you have switch being shared with multiple people, new islands are behind a 350$ paywall. This is clearly Nintendo's way of stealing money out of pure greed. Please do not fall for this trap, and save your dignity.

Now although the problem is still there, it could still be semi-fixed with a co-op run island. However this is not the case. The account who created the island practically dictates all the major decisions. Everyone else is a ""resident"" or more properly called the working class who literally does nothing other than doing what the person who created island has already completed.

And to top it all off of this crap cake is the fact that you can't back up cloud saves, which means if something happens, that's too bad!

If you are one person who owns the console, then congrats and feel blessed. If you're a family then do not buy this game, as it's a scam."

There's no way they don't have the capability to make it more than one island.  I'm just glad i haven't heard an excuse like ""It's to encourage family bonding"" or something.

Why must we resort to purchasing a separate Nintendo switch or switch lite just to have an individual untainted island to experience on our ****, the game is based around playing with friends but it can cause more harm than good when no one gets to do what they want on the game, everyone keeps getting popped to the leader while they are running their own errands, and all of the resources are hogged by the early bird. This is completely absurd and needs to be fixed. I can’t imagine that it is too hard to allow individual save files of this game.... come on Nintendo."
Germangg,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"Watched my sister play this all week while working from home only to find out I can’t enjoy the game anywhere near as much as she is. Main reasons being that I can’t have my own island, make any major infrastructure decisions, or even get the same special missions just because we both use the same switch. This was a terrible idea masked as being a “feature”."

cousinous,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"There are 4 of us.Second citizens how very strict limitation in terms of gameplay (can't donate bug, don't participate in island big decisions...).
I can't even create my own island... This limitation is not disclosed beforehand, and that is the worst part. I play several hours before realizing it, now I have only the following choices:
- Stay second class citizen
- wait for a patch
- bug another swith + game...
All ****...
I don't recommend this game for a household. Or make sure to select the right person as main citizen."
joacoandresen,"Apr 1, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is the best game I've played on my Switch after Breath of the Wild, it's THAT GOOD.

However this game is not for everyone, if you like fast paced games don't even bother. This game wasn't made for a marathon. It's a simulation game, it's kind of a mix between the best of Minecraft and the best of The Sims.

Yes, there is the problem of only one island per console, but honestly, I would buy one switch for every user just to play."
juicyadam,"Apr 1, 2020",0,I was so excited for this but limiting the game to one island per switch has ruined this experience for me.

Mojoz,"Apr 1, 2020",10,"The game is amazing. Ignore the whiney little babies crying about islands and rating it ""0"". Sure, it would be nice to be able to have multiple islands, but this doesn't make an amazing game ""0/10"". They are idiots. The game is great."
TeaCupTeddyBear,"Apr 1, 2020",0,One island is not enough! Why would you make it to where I can only have one island when I have a full household of people wanting to play? Fix this NOW!
Shigaion,"Apr 1, 2020",10,"I wasn't even planning on getting this game, but they have improved the series so much with this iteration that I picked it up anyways. Now I spend at least a few hours a day on my island. One of the biggest improvements I've found is that it seems that item randomization in the shops and from balloon gifts seems to be more tailored to your purchases that you have already made in the game, so you are more likely to get items that match the aesthetic or set that you are trying to pull together for your house. Maybe I have just gotten lucky, but when I got the game I noticed a lot of other people had really tightly designed spaces that looked great already despite how new the game is. In previous titles I had little incentive to upgrade my house for a while because of how hard it was to get the furniture and items I wanted in the store. Now I am already grinding bells to get more space. The crafting and customization mechanics are also a great improvement, and while tools that break can be a pain, it's a lot less painful to have to drop a flimsy tool to make room for resources than the normal tools in other games. I can't wait to see what else ACNH has in store, and what will come with new content!"
sophie899,"Apr 1, 2020",5,"Great gameplay. Looks beautiful, and I love the calming nature of the game. However there are a few things that really bother me playing. One part are the birdcages, and this is because I know kids play this game. They are so small the birds can’t move, and while they aren’t real I know this isn’t uncommon in real life. I don’t like to be nit-picky but I would like if they could make an updated size, so people don’t normalize that sort of treatment. I think the same should apply to goldfish and betta fish, very common pets among young children, which is the target audience of the game. These fish are more often than not kept in the same conditions portrayed , and I believe while it is a game, they should still make an example for kids."
MaybeJe,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"One island for the console !!!  Only one, it's just some kind of nightmare, I paid 60 € and they put some other restrictions on me, as if I downloaded the demo.  Shame on Nintendo, I hope this decision will be reviewed as soon as possible."
daddyro,"Apr 1, 2020",2,"I am saddened by this game. I was incredibly excited to play, and seeing that there would be couch co-op I was even more excited since I could share the experience with my Fiance! BUT, I was disappointed. There is a one island per console rule and player one has all the control. All materials are shared between players so if you chop up all the wood, hit all the rocks, and dig up anything from the ground... there will be nothing left for player two. Your best bet is to try and save up miles and visit a mystery island... which is annoying as hell. Player two can't help build homes and you can't trade bugs/fish between players either. This all has been very frustrating since my Fiance hasn't had much fun playing alongside me. The game itself has some odd mechanics too. Fishing and digging are hard as hell. There is no indicator that you are facing the right direction so most of the time you end up missing your target. Crafting items is a **** and a half. If you want to craft multiple items, you have to click to craft, watch the animation, then click back in to craft again. Repeat until you build as many items as you want. Super time consuming and annoying. All tools will break eventually, and I wish there was a durability indicator so you are aware when it will break. I do enjoy this game while playing alone, but it's a real bummer that we can't have our own separate islands and have equal participation. If that gets fixed and the other minor things change, I'll be happy with the game, but for now, I am disappointed."
Aftalion,"Apr 1, 2020",1,"The entire point of the game is to create a community on one shared island.... And you can NEVER do that because only the first player created in the game can actually be a part of it. Even if you play 1 player at a time. I can't help my girlfriend, because only her can make the story go on. It's just like I'm living here as a weird hermit who doesn't want to be a part of the community. Huge disappointment!
I recommend you don't buy this game unless you want to play it solo and not with your family on the same Switch.
This being said, the game suffers many other inconviniences even when you play solo :
Lack of mass craft or mass buy (you have to craft things one by one. Hello clams. I hate you!), for example..."

Liilaah,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"My boyfriend and I went halfsies on the game only to realise that one of us wouldn't even really get to play it properly. Pretty lousy of Nintendo - can't imagine 7 people happily being side characters in someone else's game as their only experience. I deleted my saves and let him have it since he's more excited to play, what a waste of my money."
KiritoGuy,"Apr 1, 2020",9,"This game is truly fantastic. The only reason I can't feel okay with giving it a 10/10 is because of a lack of a mass craft feature. Turning 30 clams into fish bait 1 by one can be very tedious, so if they made an update that allowed you to craft multiple at one time, it would be a perfect game and easily a contender for goty."
Nickthestick1,"Apr 1, 2020",0,Got this game for my whole family in hope that everyone could have the same enjoyment i had with Animal Crossing when i was younger. I am required to share an island with my 8 year old sister who takes all of the resources and messes with my house on the daily. This game does not deserve better rating than this due to the lack of concern for players using the same switch. Limiting 1 island per switch might be the worst desighn idea that i have ever seen from Nintendo.
Glossyhin,"Apr 1, 2020",8,"While being a first time I played this series while enjoying it  I can say that this was a good game to start with, but the 1 island a switch thing throws many people off so I’m not giving it a10/10 but this is still a good game."
Amill7,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT IS A SCAM!

It is a total scam. Only 1 player in your house gets to actually play the game. Seriously. Even if you have multiple cartrages, only the first player to start an island gets their own island. Evergone else who joins later becomes a guest on that players island. Only that player gets to place  buildings and progress the game.

The only way for everyone in your house to enjoy the full game is to caugh up an extra  $300 per person for individual consoles. There needs to be a mass boycott of this game and its design studio until they fix this outrageous travesty."
Albert0,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"Oh Nintendo. You really screwed this one up.

One island per switch is a dreadful decision. What about a typical family with a couple of kids who can only afford one console and share? Absolutely wrecked this game for a lot of people, unless of course you're player 1, then I am sure you'll have a great time."
p1tlord,"Apr 1, 2020",10,"Great game.
Cute npcs and graphics.
Who cares about sharing Switch since I am rich enough to buy a new one for my family. LOL"
brazilianloser,"Apr 1, 2020",0,Nitendo showing all its greed on this one. I am the main account on our Switch with a paid membership and all. Bought this game for the wife and she doesn't have access to a few features of the game because she is not the main user on the console. She has to basically sign up for another paid account making two paid accounts on the same console... you kidding me right? And I can't play and have a totally different island either. It would just be her stuff that she has already done. Pretty trash move by Nitendo.
Dashax,"Apr 1, 2020",3,"This game is absolutely amazing with one big huge mistake. I understand the second, third and etc. player maybe shouldn't have a say in the Islands big decisions. I understand where they're coming from considering it could maybe cause progress to go too fast or cause chaos on an island with up to 8 people. But PLEASE, TELL ME WHY THERE ISN'T AN OPTION TO SWITCH PLAYER 1. Many of us made player 1 whitin our family without the commitment of knowing they will have a say in EVERYTHING to come. There should be an option to change that later on without having to delete the island. I'm extremely disappointed that such a well thought-out game didn't think this through."

Better fix it soon we're not taking any of this ****
1mooey,"Apr 1, 2020",10,Fantastic game and fun to play. Although you can’t have more than one island it doesn’t bother me. I play with one other person and it’s still fun.
Abismovilchez,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"LAMENTABLE que el segundo jugador esté tan limitado y no pueda ni aprender a fabricar el hacha... es una verguenza que un juego para disfrutar con tus hermanos, familia, amigos etc solo lo pueda jugar en condiciones 1 persona y para colmo no es precisamente barato.

ArmorForSleep,"Apr 1, 2020",0,A useless game that doesn’t work if you want to h e fun with your partner or family member. One island per console limits play to such a degree that it is no longer playable. Co-op is a joke and the limits they place on players they might as well just get rid of the option and just call it a single player game.
Kaiser1871,"Apr 1, 2020",3,"I honestly fell left behind when playing this game. It feels like I am an NPC in this game. So here is the jist, I bought the game the day after it came out, I more or less bought it on impulse. I let the game download, and my brother got his mitts on it and began the game.  I just got on, and learned that I have to share the island with him. Now this alone, I can get past, what bugs me is that IM LIMITED ON WHAT I CAN DO. What I can do is 100% reliant on my brother's work, it is VERY poor game design. It is GREEDY to make your customers buy ANOTHER SWITCH. You can't even cloud save... This game is fun though. Like I normally don't play games like this, but from my limited amount of things I can do, I enjoyed it. Usually I love Nintendo and their products, but this is the first time I have felt cheated by them. I'm sure this game deserves a higher score, alas, I haven't played Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I've played Animal Crossing: New Horizons - The Demo."
Carny,"Apr 1, 2020",9,Its Animal crossing but the multiplayer isn't good. Other than that it's great.
Nywildlife22,"Apr 1, 2020",0,Only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff. The other players on the island can’t contribute and can only really gather resources. I hope Nintendo fixes this.
danipilot,"Apr 1, 2020",4,"I bought the game and I share my Switch with my brother. I let him start the game and when I was about to play I realized I could only play on his island and do basically nothing. I bought the game AND the console and I can't actually play the game.

So, only solution is to kindly ask my brother to delete all his save for me to really be able to play the game, he's been playing for several days so I understand it can also be frustrating for him.

Not having in consideration this HUGE issue, the game seems quite nice and enjoyable, but I find it really too important to just let it pass. That's why I give this low rate. I really expect Nintendo to fix this issue and let different account on the same console to run their own island, if they do so, I will consider remaking this review according to the actual quality of the game itself."
Jacinta,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"UPDATE: we just unlocked terraforming, and it looks like this is another feature that player 2 misses out on. I don’t even care that I share an island with my bf, but the fact I can’t make any impactful changes to how the island looks **** - I was really looking forward to creating a beautiful island but all I can do is plant flowers & trees. I can’t make pathways, bridges or terraform at all. I can’t understand why Nintendo has done this Like many others here, I’m really disappointed by the restrictions of player 2/ any player that isn’t the founder. Me and my bf got this game to play together but soon found out player 2 can’t make any executive decisions, doesn’t have access to any of the quests, can’t place buildings/infrastructure, and ultimately misses out on a lot of the story. This ****!! It means one of us misses out on the full experience of the game. This is unfortunately not rectified by the option for co-op play, which is just a joke. Co-op works by having one ‘leader’ that can play as normal, and then the ‘followers’. The followers can’t access their tool wheel, inventory or leave the same screen as the leader, which just results in really boring gameplay. The follower is just essentially reduced to being a pack mule for the leader, and unable to really contribute in any way, as it takes so long to cycle through your tools to really be able to do anything. It **** because it would’ve been SO fun to play together co-op, but Nintendo really missed the mark with these limitations. The only work around is to get a new switch and second copy of the game, which is ridiculous! It’s such a shame because playing the game solo has been really great, but the fact that you have to buy multiple consoles for everyone to get the full experience of the game is just terrible, and for that i can’t justify giving this game a good rating"

Dialogkiller,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"This game has way too much useless dialog. Seriously it is extremely annoying.
1. When building the museum the stupid owl runs through 500 words just so you can donate one at a time before opening. 2. When upgrading or moving houses it literally calls inthe box for a useless conversation about moving.
**** interaction with new box is a time sink.
4. The game doesn't give you an option to have fasted dialog. 5. You need to go through the dumbest receptive dialog when accessing stores or the nook system.
This game is honestly not as seamless as it should be.
When placing down trees or buildings you get no indication whether or not it's going to fit. And if it does and its not aligned as you want it you have to re do the dialog to place again. Why is there no outline indication. I really enjoyed the start but as the game progresses and there's more stuff to do. 2 hour useless npc talking and A button smashing is getting annoying. Going to fly in the airport? Yeah wait 1122 years for the stupid dodo to shutup.

Wanna craft multiple items? You wish there was a craft X amount. No you need to re do the craft dialog Not seamless. And a game like this needs to be or all you get is frustration. Seriously in a game based around design why can't you get align grids when placing trees or plans. Instead of wasting 50k to relocate to fit. And before evem getting to pay the fee to relocate you need to go thru the same dialog over n over. The developers literally assumed the player base to be 11 year olds mostly."
coreygeier,"Apr 1, 2020",0,"Giving a zero star review because I've never played this game. I own a Switch console with my roommates. I was thinking about buying New Horizons, but my roommate bought it first and started a file. I sat down to start my own file and then we realized the game's terrible multiplayer situation. She didn't exactly want me to play on her file, and I didn't want to have to intrude on her game. Furthermore, I want to have the whole experience of the game as someone who has never played an Animal Crossing game before. There is nothing I can do to have my own file except to buy an entire new console and game. Somehow, I don't think Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be worth a $360 price tag.
It's completely ridiculous that Breath of the Wild, a massive open world game that takes up 14G of storage and is one of the most popular releases for the system (as well as every other game) was able to find a way to allow for multiple save files for different users but Animal Crossing couldn't? We talked to Nintendo's support about the problem and they mentioned that the single file system was to maintain the game's ""artistic integrity."" Well, Nintendo, thanks to all that integrity, I can't play this game. I hope they release an update to fix the save file issue because I really would like to experience this game."
lalalandin,"Apr 1, 2020",0,Why is there a limit to only one island per switch? This is ridiculous. Having to pay an exorbitant amount of money for another switch AND game is beyond being rude to your customers. Not to mention the fact that it’s impossible to get your hands on a new switch because they’re sold out everywhere. PLEASE consider changing this. Nobody wants to play a game where all you do is collect resources without being a part of the dialogue or events. Your rating on here is tanking because of this ONE ISSUE. Please fix this for your customers or else we won’t be customers anymore.
ridley369,"Apr 1, 2020",4,"As a diehard fan of the series, who's sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into them all, and who STILL plays the GameCube version almost daily since 2002, I'm really disappointed with this one.

I'm going to give objective reasons, followed by my subjective opinions afterward. So let's just get right into it...

1) One town per Switch? Why? GameCube let you have a town per memory card, and that was almost 20 years ago. Also, why is whoever founds the town, the one who can make the progress in the game?

2) Dialogue. It's common agreement in the fanbase that, every AC game after the original has gotten worse with villager dialogue, with New Horizons, it's really hit rock bottom. One liners seem to be the most common response when talking to villagers; Yesterday, one of mine said ""Today was fun!"" four times in a row. Are you actually serious, Nintendo?

3) Furniture. Where in the world are the themed furniture sets? The different series? The Animal Crossing games' lifeblood is its unique and themed furniture. Yes, I'm aware there are a few out there - Rattan, Imperial, Cute - I may be missing one or two others, but I don't think so, at least not that I'm aware of so far. And seasonal/holiday sets don't count, because they're exclusive to those holidays and events. I'm talking about run-of-the-mill sets you could always hope to find at Nook's, or receive from villagers, and so on. Where's the Modern series? Classic? Cabana? Lovely? Exotic? Why am I seeing, for the most part, the same, or identical pieces of furniture rotated in my (upgraded) Nook's Cranny? It's all the same generic, non-themed pieces with slight color variations - and this also applies to flooring and wallpaper, which seemed to be as generic as they possibly could be. Are sets being added in later? If so, why? Why couldn't they be included as part of the base game?

4) House expansion. There's so much extensive customization in mostly all other aspects of New Horizons, yet we have to upgrade our house in a rigid, set-in-stone order. Why? I just wanted to have the expanded central room, with the 2nd floor and maybe basement later on. Such was my surprise when I found out that I HAVE to add a back room, then I have to pay it off and then I HAVE to add the left room, then add the right room, THEN I could have the second floor. Why, Nintendo? In New Leaf, we were given the option as to how we wanted to expand, and the second story was the first upgrade after expanding your main room. I don't want side rooms, why can't I upgrade my house how I want like in the other games? I NEED to know why you've deliberately removed this.

**Subjective gripes

1) Very few patterns/shirts from the other games, which have always been staples. We're still early into the year and gameplay, so I'm sure they change with the seasons, but so far I've only seen the Misty Shirt and Frog Shirt, as far as staple clothing.

2) Totakeke songs shouldn't be buyable from the terminal in the town hall, because it negates any real reason to listen to K.K. play songs and get the airchecks from him, since you can just buy 7 different songs in a week. More, if you're a time traveler.

3) Where are the gyroids? Another staple of the Animal Crossing series, completely absent, save for Lloid, and he's not furniture so he doesn't count.

4) Art exhibit in the museum - why is it not in the game? Art has been a collectible item in every AC game, yet not only can we not donate them to the museum (the exhibit doesn't exist), but we art pieces aren't even in the game. Not even paintings. Why? I'm sure they're going to be in some DLC down the road, but why weren't they included in the base game?

I'm gonna leave it at this, despite probably being able to think of a few more subjective points. In conclusion, this game is fun, it's very customizable for the most part, and there's lots of interesting things to do, but as an Animal Crossing game, it doesn't hold up. There was more to do, collect, buy, etc. 20 years ago in the first game, than in New Horizons.
Nintendo (and I'm not afraid to say this) half-assed this game. It feels rushed and very incomplete, despite the fact that New Leaf came out 7 years ago, wherein they had all that time to really make the most amazing Animal Crossing experience ever. They dropped the ball, and as a passionate lover of this series, I'm extremely disappointed, and it makes me really sad to have to say that, not even two weeks after it came out."

Pnymlc,"Mar 31, 2020",3,"If you have a family of kids who might have some interest in playing this game and you don’t have enough Switch consoles for each of them to have their own island, you may want to reconsider your purchase to avoid family feuds. Currently sharing with 4 family members (5th one pending) and while this game is fun for a solo player with your own island, once you have new players move in, you have to share (Or force others to share) limited resources, creative space, argue over plots of land, villagers and landscaping decisions. You have to greatly modify your play in order to accommodate for others on your island, which may be fun in some cases (co op with your SO) but with kids/others who will ruin things or don’t care about sharing.. your game experience is significantly reduced. Only the first player gets the special missions/rewards and any additional profile that moves in to the island is left in the dark as far as instructions and introductions and additional perks. For $60 you get to fight over who gets to play first in the day to get the limited resources of the island, and for the small cost of ANOTHER console, you can have a separate island for a second player! In the past you can easily have extra game cartridges/memory files for new islands but now you have to buy a whole additional console?! With 7 players in the house, we do pretty good with sharing the Switch so we know we don’t need a second one, so why would you force your players to have a second console for another island? This is outrageous of the game developers, and I will not condone this behavior by big companies who already have a lot of money to begin with. I refuse to patronize Nintendo and Animal Crossing any further because of their apparent and disgusting greed."

I can't get another switch and a second copy, I get my stuff with a part time job, and my brother is only 11.

itsdotcom,"Mar 31, 2020",0,"Would actually give this a full 9 or 10, but this game is ruined in my house unless we buy an entire second Switch console (which is ridiculous). My partner wants to play this game, but can't make his own island, and as I've already started, has way less say over being creative on the island. If we knew about this, we could potentially have played differently, but to have no choice is absolutely ridiculous. Now one of us will miss out on the full experience."
Skalper,"Mar 31, 2020",0,"This game is built on GREED, and it is taken to a whole new level. It blows my mind how they purposely designed this so only one open game can be played per switch. All users must share the same island, which is only built for one. Buying second copies wont help. Oh no, Nintendo wants you to buy a second switch, maybe even a third with additional copies for each of course. Wow. We all bought your damn game what more do you want? Save your money and pass on this one for the principal alone. They didnt even share this flaw until it was too late."
NewGamer136,"Mar 31, 2020",2,My son and daughter have always lovedAnimal Crossing. They were thrilled that New Horizons was coming out and that we could all play together. The game is great for 1 player. The graphics and play ability is awesome. It stinks for multi player. As the second or third player you can’t really do anything but walk behind player one. You have no value and don’t add to the gameplay. I would love to see a split screen option or where each player can have the same gameplay as the creator of the island.
madikc,"Mar 31, 2020",3,"Some seriously questionable mechanics.  Like for example, in order to play online so your friends can visit your island, you have to enter the airport, sit through the same dialog text, tell the NPC at the counter to open your island for visitors, wait while the game saves and shows a 'Connecting to internet' screen for 10 secs.  Then the island will be open for visitors.

The problem is, if you want to do practically anything in the game (send a letter, turn in the daily ghost quest, etc), you have to go back to that NPC, turn off online play (sitting through the same text and screens), just to do that action.  Then you have to travel back once you've done your thing, and re-enable the island.  It's just annoying, tedious, frustrating, and seemingly unnecessary - considering you're always online - case in point, friends can text you on your in-game phone... they just cannot visit you.  Super dumb.

Now lets say you want to have multiple people in the house play the game, and each person wants their own playthrough - cannot happen.  The game will literally only let you have one playthrough per Switch, and everyone has to share the same island.  That means a family member can clean the whole island out (smash all the rocks, dig up all the fossils, etc), and when you decide to play later, the island is picked clean.  Not to mention someone can advance the story, and you miss it.  Seriously not cool.  We have 3 people in our family that play the Switch, and only 1 can play Animal Crossing.

There are also gameplay mechanics that were badly implemented.  For example, if you want to sell items (which is the only real way to make money), you have two choices: walk up to the store mailbox and sell the items -or- enter the store, wait for the load screen, talk to the store keeper and go through his dialogue, sell your items, leave the store, watch the loading screen again.  The problem is you get 100% of the sell price of your items if you talk to the storekeep, but only like 60% of the price if you use the box on the outside of the store.  They explain the outside box as a way to sell items whenever the store is closed (they are open 9am to 10pm daily), but at the penalty of changing you a heavy fee.  I get why the outside-hours-box charges a fee (even if I think it's a stupid mechanic), but why are they charging me the fee when the store is still open?  Why must I sit through two loading screens and a dialogue tree just to vend my items at full price?

It's mechanics like this that really **** the fun out of the game, and turn it into a downright chore.  The novelty of the cute load screens, or crafting animations, or lengthy repetitive dialogue really gets in the way of fun.  Also it loses 4 points outright for the dumb single island mechanic.  Bad job, Nintendo."
SubhanAhmed,"Mar 31, 2020",0,I haven’t even bought the game and I was about to but I heard there is one island per CONSOLE. Cmon Nintendo????!!!! There are many families that can not afford multiple switches for their kids. There are couples who share switches and now you are taking away the ability to have multiple islands on a single console. I get it if you don’t want to have multiple islands on ONE ACCOUNT but having one island per account just makes more sense. Don’t be greedy guys... you are the company that brings kids together and you are taking away that experience. Do you know how many parents will have to disappoint their kids that they all cannot play the game? People aren’t  rich....... please change this. I just want to understand why Nintendo would want to do this. Is there cheating involved in multiple accounts on a switch? If there is then so what??? People skip days to get bells in the game! To some people that is cheating but you won’t take that away!!! ( I don’t think it really is cheating) Let multiple people play the game on one system. It just makes sense.....please change this quick so more people can buy the game. It was never marketed like this!!!!
Cucu123,"Mar 31, 2020",0,"As others have said, unplayable and absolutely terrible multiplayer.  We have 3 young kids, and the level of frustration is enormous.  Until this is fixed, if you are buying for a family with multiple kids, you must avoid at all costs."
SilvioVaso,"Mar 31, 2020",0,No Nintendo Just no. Nintendo you have to realize that families don't have multiple switches the switch is a family console and you decided to make it 1  island per switch. nobody is gonna buy a new switch just to have another island. The game was meant to be an island for you and only you you shouldn't expect people to receive this well. I have a sibling and we were ecstatic when we got this game. We got this game for primarily my sister but I was also ready to make my own island until i realized that me and my sister would have to share a island Now at first i was okay with this but then it set in that If i was the leader my sister couldn't pick up a branch. Nintendo please fix this. You will be praised if you will
Pandaman888,"Mar 31, 2020",0,"I have never played an Animal Crossing game before, but I was really looking forward to this one given the hype and the fact that my partner is a huge fan of the series. However, after purchasing the game for AU$80 I realise I can't actually play this game properly as a non-primary account.

I'm honestly baffled at this decision by the developers. I mean I'm happy to buy a new copy of the game if it means that I can enjoy the full experience myself, but this is not even an option; I actually have to buy a whole new copy AND a new Switch as well? This move is worse than anything EA has done with its micro-transactions in my opinion. What a way to sell more Switch consoles; it's either genius or disgusting. For those who have money, it's probably the former, but I for one have lost a lot of respect for Nintendo.

Given that I can't even experience the game for what it really is, and that my Switch console is forever barred from Animal Crossing (unless I delete my partner's save), I have to give this a 0/10."
Nuphoth,"Mar 31, 2020",2,"I love everything about this game except for the fact that it’s limited to one island per game. This becomes a pain when you’re sharing with your family. Nintendo, I have been playing your games for as long as I can remember, but unfortunately my experience with Animal Crossing: New Horizons has been completely ruined because of your one business move. Not everyone has the time and money to buy multiple consoles for a single game. Please, Nintendo, allow users on the same switch to have different islands. I would happily change my rating to a 10 if this were the case. Your goal should be to keep the ENTIRE community happy."
Ejespl907,"Mar 31, 2020",0,My wife and I just bought the game.  I loved Animal Crossing when I was a kid and was excited to show her how to play and compare our islands progress.  We started off with her account and she got everything set up and started.  When I went to create my island I was shocked that all the decisions had been made and I was off to the island my wife created.  I missed out on all decisions and interactions that make Animal Crossing your own.  I kind of feel robbed of getting to play the game like I did as a kid.  Nintendo should seriously consider releasing a patch that at least allows you the option to have separate save files for separate accounts.  To my knowledge all other games on the Switch treat each account as a independent save file.  Please Nintendo make this right!
FreaknTurtle,"Mar 31, 2020",4,I love backwards games design. Like not being able to have my own separate island or playing coop and being a glorified spectator.
FlyingBanana,"Mar 31, 2020",0,"Unfortunately as much as the game is gorgeous and pretty, for me as player two it is just unplayable and does not offer anything. Neither can I progress in the game nor can I create my own separate save file as I'm sharing the Switch with someone else. A hugely absurd design choice for the game that promised so much. Shared island could be manageable but limiting progress to player 1 is insane these days. Either me or the other person playing will be unsatisfied. Unfortunately all the fun is spoiled because of that and except of Player 1 there is simply no reason to play. Unfortunately I cannot get a refund due to my country's law but if I could I would definitely get it and I regret I actually bought the game and gave my money to Nintendo. And the best thing that it was never clearly said in official promoting materials about this limitation. Very bad move, will definitely think more than twice about buying any of their games in the future. I truly don't recommend this game if you're gonna play with someone else, don't make my mistake and don't buy it."
KKittiy,"Mar 31, 2020",4,"Frankly I’m disappointed in Nintendo. I am new to animal crossing I have no experience with previous games. However all that being said it’s a good game. I has good graphics but it’s lacking on a few points. First one island per switch is insane. I have two sisters, my family can not afford 3 switches so we cannot all play a 60$ game. Next, the game functions in real time in some ways that’s awesome things rely on time of day. But also I am a student who cannot log on all day so I miss certain fish and bugs. With it running in real time it takes real days for jobs to be completed. For example you place the lot for a house after 5am the following morning it will be built. The only real story to the game is improving your house and island. All other aspects are a gathering aspect, as in find resources. When improving your house you don’t get to pick new roof or bigger room it’s a set order each becoming more and more expensive. I understand teaching the player responsibility but playing the game the proper way without exploits (like tarantulas) makes a 2.5 million $/bells loan unrealistic. With loans and things you pick what they are for. I’m also loosing interest because after playing for a week I’m still stuck with an island I cannot customize. I have great plans for what I want but no way to do them. I thought I was buying a game I could sit and play for hours but I don’t see how that is possible when I can’t do anything. I fish and catch bugs with hopes of paying my crazy house loans and for what? Weeks upon weeks before I can do what I desire. Maybe think twice about purchasing it is definitely not worth the hype."
FireStarV,"Mar 31, 2020",1,"I have 4 kids, 3 of which play this game, with only a single Island per Switch this has become a disappointment among the children. One child has unlocked most of the items on the Island and the other ones were disappointed about that. Whoever is on first gets to collect the resources on the home island for the day. I am disappointed with how the game makers decided to do this when the switch handles profiles so well compared to previous Nintendo products. All other games that my kids have played have also handled profiles and separation of those profiles well also. This is why I feel that this deserves a very low score. I hope they find a fix for this."
K_M-A-Y_,"Mar 31, 2020",1,"I was really looking forward to playing this game with my fiance, especially since we were in self isolation, but Nintendo has gone and ruined couch coop again. As the second player, I am pretty much useless. And that's playing solo as the second account. Playing together on the same screen is a complete joke. You literally serve no purpose. The coop is just the tip of the iceberg though. Nintendo is so authoritarian now that they want to control everything you do in their games. The time it takes to do anything in this game is comparable to a mobile game like clash of clans. I'm honestly surprised that there aren't gems you can buy to speed things up. I get it's supposed to be relaxing and slow, but if I want to play the game for 8 hours in a day (because I'm stuck at home from COVID-19) and progress, I should be able to. Instead I get at most 2 hours of play time and thats with visiting other islands using nook tickets.  Overall, the game is very disappointing. There aren't really any improvements over the older games, so I guess I'll just dust off my game cube because New Horizons just isn't very good."

SkittyScatt94,"Mar 31, 2020",10,Amazing game! New Horizons perfectly embodies the  Animal Crossing franchise!
Kire_92,"Mar 31, 2020",5,"This is the first Animal Crossing I’ve ever played. I love similar games so I thought I will give this a try. However, it’s not as funs as I had hoped.

The game has a lot of charm and give me that relaxing and laid back feeling that I was looking for. Though it somehow feels a little lackluster. It stats out very slow and progressively gets better. But it never reaches a high enough point that I feel drawn to it. Most things get repetitive fast and it doesn’t feel as rewarding as I would like. It’s also to simple for my taste, both when it comes to difficulty and depth.

I still play it for a few minutes every day, though it does not provide as much enjoyment compared to other games. I don’t regret the purchase, but It’s not a game I would recommend to likeminded individuals. However, I can see how it can be enjoyable to some people."

TacoLord424,"Mar 31, 2020",9,"I'm genuinely in love with the Animal Crossing games. I've played every single one and have loved all of them. New Horizons is my favorite to date. This game opens up a lot of opportunities for new players and doesn't push old players away. The island is nice and big and has lots to do. The first couple of days of playing are relatively boring but as soon as you get passed them the game really opens up. I want to point out the fact that I am the only one in my entire family who plays video games so I have no experience with the only one player is the ruler, but I completely understand the frustration and I would be frustrated too. Hopefully, Nintendo fixes that in an update soon, but for that issue, I'm docking off one point. Honestly, this is a great game, I highly recommend it."
Otolith,"Mar 31, 2020",0,"It’s a fun game but the multiplayer options for this game when played on the same Switch are ridiculous and warrant a 0 rating. Only the “primary” player (the first player on the island) is able to progress through the storyline and complete certain quests. I’ve been running around the island for three days now and I can’t get an axe to progress further because the primary player of the game has lost interest already and hasn’t opened the axe up in their game. So I have to either log in as them and play as them and do these things or quit. I choose to quit the game. This is a ridiculous way to design a game. I find it mind boggling that developers sat down in meetings during development, discussed this, and decided it was a great idea.  Then that great idea was coded, tested, and still made it into the final cut. How does something like this get implemented?  Have these developers ever played a multiplayer game?  Who actually thinks like this?  Who wants to play a game and be eliminated from content just because they are not the “first” player of the game?  Who tested this feature and liked it?  It’s just dumb game design, period.

I have asked for a refund, not sure if it will be approved but the request has been made."
nialld3223,"Mar 31, 2020",2,"I own the Nintendo Switch in our house but bought the game for my girlfriend to play. I also want to play this game but realised very quickly that my Animal Crossing experience was stunted, as my island was a carbon copy of my girlfriend's island that she'd been working on for the past week. All the major decisions so far in the game have already been made for me and I literally do not have the power to do any more.
I can't help but think it would've been easier for the game devs to make it so we had our own individual islands in the first place instead of implementing this stupid shared island feature that literally no one asked for. At this point in time it's impossible for me to play this game."

Doodlles,"Mar 31, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is a great game and something different from the other games from this franchise in the past. It saved the AC games from the mobile ones that they were producing and provides a great story. The game isn't perfect but is enjoyable to play. These are some things I think they might need to work on possibly adding. 1.) Villagers need more life to them like in other games, I think having quests to do from them would be a great way to have a bond with your villagers. 2.) I know this is what a lot of people are saying but, have more than 1 account for a switch; you could even make it to where it only can be another Nintendo ID to have another island. 3.) The online cut scene for a player arriving to your island is dreadful to watch, at first its cool but then after a while of having to watch it, it is tedious and annoying; especially if you constantly have people joining and leaving. A simple solution could be to have a button to skip or just not have it ( If possible). 4.) More interaction with items, this one could be a simple update to make more of the items have a better interaction with it, such as the Tea-Cups that spin. The game would become more fun and make players want the items more if they have something to do with them other than just for decoration. These are some of the changes I think Nintendo could apply to Animal Crossing New Horizons to make the game more enjoyable than it already is."

Only the first profile to play gets a a game.  Everyone else gets to be a second class tourist.  Multiple profiles have to share that island, and only the primary player can travel to deserted islands, make building decisions, and things like that.  Instead of experiencing a beloved franchise, I have kids fighting over who gets to dig up fossils, collect the seashells for income, ****...

Sommy88,"Mar 31, 2020",2,"Bought this game for having a relaxing time. Unfortunately the game stress the heck out of you for the wrong reasons

-No cloud save
-Only one island per switch and only one normal player per switch.

-No buyable baits
-nearly impossible to catch special fishes
-unneccessary unskippable dialogue for every little thing(yeah it's the 10000 fish i take or the 10000 bait i made, STOP WASTING MY TIME)

Everything is geared upon making you waste time, turning an adorable and relaxing experience in a neverending and frustrating series of chores .

I am sorry, i really would like to love this game. But to me it's obvious that more testing, more QoL measures and a more modern approach would have been way better and needed for the masterpiece we were really waiting for.

We started playing this game together after getting it for my six year old daughter. Progress is tied to her account and progress for everyone else is dependant on what she does.  Kids don't understand this mechanic and they shouldn't have to.

So my daughter has unlocked (with some help from me) the the part where you build the bridge followed by three new houses.  There is a lot of grinding for resources and crafting required for this - but the other players can't even help out by contributing materials or even getting the recipes for the items that need to be crafted!  We're just passengers and the whole experience feels cheap and empty.

There aren't even ways to get recipes for certain furniture because there is no access to the story or even simple town upgrades like bridges and inclines if you aren't player one! This is ridiculous and Nintendo knows it, especially because these restrictions are not something Nintendo was upfront about because they knew it would hurt game sales. The absolute lack of care for it's customers in this regard is just not something I had come to expect from Nintendo and I am shocked and appaled. I payed for the game too and every player on the system should be able to play regardless of whether everyone is on the same island or not. Either make all players equal or give everyone their own island... because what we have at current is a game thats only fit to be played by player one. While I do understand that Nintendo is attempting to sell more consoles (though that's not even possible at this time due to them being sold out nearly everywhere) they are also selling a product, Animal Crossing is a product that people payed $60 and it CAN be held to the standard that every player in the game can actually... you know... play. Nintendo not being upfront about the fact that it is essentially a game only able to be played by one person oer console turns animal crossing into a **** product for everyone who shares a switch, which might I add with it's multiple accounts per console, was marketed as a sharable family console when it first came out, not something like a ds that everyone was meamt to have their own... I'm just going to be honest, if you share a switch don't get the game, not until something changes. Either you'll be the resident representative and you're family or partner will be stuck being upset amd probably a bit resentful (Ive been in and heard of plenty of fights breaking out over this game in families) or you'll be the second player and will find your gameplay  so limited you'd be just as well off playing the free mobile game pocket camp. If you have your own switch, great, good for you, get the game I'm sure its a blast, if not, maybe get an older edition of the game or wait until its possible to buy another console, or play a game like **** with a similar vibe to animal crossing. Just do anything but buy this game because you will be disappointed."
Oldbutterface,"Mar 31, 2020",3,"Bought this game for me and my girlfriend to both play. The 'one island per switch' rule is dumbfounding. For a series that's supposed to be all about creativity and exploration, this unnecessary decision completely undermines that as we are both limited to one tiny island.

However what's really annoying is that my girlfriend is the primary resident so she gets to do all the fun stuff whereas all I can do is harvest resources. None of the NPCs really care about me at all, I have nothing to do to progress anything, my progress actually is hindered, and the experience generally **** ass. Not really a £50 experience in my opinion.

I'm not going to buy a 2nd switch just to have my own experience. That's totally ridiclous. I'm disappointed in you nintendo as you were the last gaming company catering for families and multiplayer but this decision is stupid and just comes across as greed. There is no reason for this. I get you may be worried about resource harvesting manipulation but this is animal crossing so who cares?

Cant see this having a long shelf life in my collection tbh because after the initial novelty I've realised im just left with an empty shell **** while primary resident player 1 gets the full experience.

This is fixable. Patch it and allow multiple islands per switch. I know why you didn't want to do this, but in limiting all users to one island, you limit all fun to one player and resource gathering is torturous."
vhubert,"Mar 31, 2020",0,this game straight up **** nards. one island per a switch was BS now i just found out if you want to move a building slightly over from where you put it you have to pay 50000 bells to move it to a entirely new spot and then wait a day then pay an additional 50000 bells to move it where you wanted and wait another full day thats straight up **** like wtf
Tanner1997,"Mar 31, 2020",10,Made an account just to give this game a A glowing review. I’m not a person that usually even plays video games but I went out and bought a switch just play animal Crossing and I couldn’t be more happy with the gameplay I’m excited to wake up every morning and see what’s changed on the island
weirdducks,"Mar 31, 2020",3,"While there are many good points with the game. I do enjoy playing, but the underlying issues of the lack of multiple islands, and the fact tools break are annoying and un-enjoyable. The idea that your tools break so often should mean the furniture you make as well should break just as often as tools. It just takes everything out of the groove and just infuriating when your tools just break over and OVER again."
Valthroc,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"Its a great game. The bad reviews are literally only about the whole no multiple island thing. Sure, it **** if you want to share or whatever, but, honestly, giving it a 0 because your little brother can't have his own island? Kinda crazy.."
Trex2319,"Mar 30, 2020",3,"It is actually a great game but has a huge major flaw that literally can ruin it and Nintendo needs to fix it so what happened to me with this is I bought the game but I was at work the day it came out so I couldn’t play it but my sister started the game so now I can’t do the main quests of the game I **** bought unless I steal my sisters account or **** start over literally no reason for this at all it’s a hella easy fix, either add multiple islands or saves or just **** let other players do the main Tom nook town development quests."
Naida,"Mar 30, 2020",1,.... You already know why. One player per console isn't quite right for such a fun game. It's no fun for siblings to fight over being the founder. Hopefully this might get patched.
imtheamora,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"This game is fantastic, a brand new feel to the game that pulls it off well. But one question remains, why does this game have so many bad reviews? Most of them seem to be bland reviews that are most likely spam."
SMKing99,"Mar 30, 2020",1,"If you are the first person to boot up the game you basically are the only person that will have fun playing the game.

If you are the second person you realize that what you get to do is extremely limited compared to the first person. Every profile should get their own island. If you are the second person to play you lose opportunities. Like building structures. Having a say in the towns name. And it's harder for you to get resources to build things. If it wasn't for these problems this game would be a easy 10/10

I doubt that they will fix this problem because nintendo never does. So if you have a family that all want to play this game is a pass."
Sax1202,"Mar 30, 2020",1,Love most of the mechanics in the game and I love seeing the community for this game grow but I have one major problem. You can’t have separate islands per switch. Ruins the experience for me and the other people in the house since they can’t progress without me playing.
rothedwards,"Mar 30, 2020",0,Seems like a great game.  Unfortunately...  I have bought two copies and cannot progress due to horrible game design.  How could they put out something to the public with such a huge flaw??
whoisum,"Mar 30, 2020",0,1 snow white seven dwarfs (with no power). Ridiculous. Nintendo knows better than this.
Rb_Drache,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"Not a perfect game, but definitely a great one.

Cons:
1. Online multiplayer waiting screen
You have to wait for 30~60 seconds every time someone visits or leaves your island. The waiting screen is kinda cute, but when you're playing with, let's say, 5 other people, you have to see that screen 10 times per session.

2. No bulk crafting/wonky inventory management
Animal crossing didn't have that many kinds of stackable items before New Horizons, and DS, 3DS, Wii version all had either touch screen or Wii remote which made pulling out items from the stack really fast and convenient, even if you can only remove 1 from the stack at a time. However, in NH you have to slowly remove an item from the stack each time, and the fact you can have 30 woods per stack (and even more for some items) doesn't help here. Also, the problem of slow, repetitive tasks is also in crafting, especially when you're crafting fish baits with manila clams.

3. No cloud save (yet)
I won't elaborate.

4. Game's progression is tied to the first player.
Can cause a huge pain if the first player stops playing this game. You should, at the very least, be able to change who's the boss among the players.

From here, I'll talk about the problem everyone is ranting about, but personally I didn't have a big  problem with it.
5. Local multiplayer
The problem I have with the local multiplayer, is the fact second player don't have access to the tool wheel, and they somehow can't even hold an umbrella. You will have like 6 tools in your inventory and it takes ages to cycle through them. Also, the second player goes ""HEY I FOUND THIS"" like Link every time they collects an item, which takes too long if you're picking up several items, like when you're chopping or shaking a tree. Other than that, it's quite fun running around chopping trees and catching fish, wandering around with my sister.

6. One island per console
I understand everyone's frustration about this, but personally, I would like to share island with my family and renovate the island to a beautiful place, where our whole family worked together and have lovely memories about them. The lack of the choice isn't that good, so I'll put this as cons anyway.

Now, I won't write about Pros here, but it's overall much better than the last game I've played, which is the Wii version of animal crossing.

PSA: This game is NOT all about progression. The progression lies within how the island changes as you put efforts in it, building museum and upgrading resident service is only a part of it."
Animalcrossed,"Mar 30, 2020",2,I don’t expect there to be different islands per player but the fact that essentially one character gets the story line while the others do nothing is horrible! What a waste of money for everyone to not be able to truly enjoy the game. Animal crossing should remove the resident representative role completely or AT LEAST make it transferable. This needs to be patched quickly or I’m not sure I’m buying another animal crossing game. It’s not as family friendly as it promotes itself to be
Cnic44,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"This should be advertised as a single- player game. Multiplayer is pointless. You can open your emote options as the second player but not your tool options? Nintendo what were you thinking?? I wanted to play this with my wife but we have to just take turns because it's no fun to be the second player. You just follow the leader around... I am extremely disappointed with the ant antiquated feel of the multiplayer system and even the online system. I why can't I be in multiplayer mode and have my wife and I both go visit another person? It's 2020 and if Nintendo wants to charge me for online they need to give me features that are worth paying for. I love the game, but have to review it poorly because of the crap job they did with the multiplayer. Seems to me that they wanted everyone to go out and buy more switches and extra animal crossing games in order to truly play multiplayer. Shame on you Nintendo!"
magna10,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"Nothing could have prepared me for how awful this game is. It  was hyped to oblivion, and I bought it at it's full, ludicrous $60 price tag, and the game is nothing. You gather and you sell so you can place and gather. That's it. That's literally the entire game summarized in one sentence. This is a $30 game at best. I'm so unfathomably disappointed, I thought this was going to be an amazing experience, and it's nothing. Don't get me started on the multiplayer, easily the most antiquated thing I've seen in any modern game, or the fact that you can only have one island. Waste of time and money completely."
tantei,"Mar 30, 2020",3,The island save state situation is un acceptable. The game also is really slow at the start even for an animal crossing.
Frogblast,"Mar 30, 2020",3,I am second player and nothing to do.  Totally un acceptable for a 80$ game!!!
Ozzywichi,"Mar 30, 2020",0,Such a shame. Thanks for tethering progression and such to one person. Maybe there'll be a patch but I wont be holding my breath.
JackThunder,"Mar 30, 2020",3,"For a $60 game, my whole family should be able to have their own game. I kinda feel duped. Sharing an Island!! Really!! Im not going to buy multiple copies of the same games and multiple $400 game stations for individual accounts. Nintendo has gotten so **** greedy. This isnt hard to change . The company should fix this. Thr game itself is really fun, but this inconvenience makes it very disappointing."
RNGesusR6,"Mar 30, 2020",10,I never played the original version but got both the one on the 3ds and Wii I loved both. This is a great improvement on those game bring new mechanics to the game we all have loved. The shared world has always been a thing so I don’t get the outrage but to me it’s amazing
Tylenor,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"Excellent game, best installment in the series by far! I noticed a lot of idiots who apparently never played an animal crossing game before are reviewbombing here. Let me enlighten you on the fact that “one island/town per console” has been a thing since the first Animal crossing on the GameCube. No, it’s not a feature that’s been removed from the game or anything, it’s the animal crossing standard that it’s player one’s world and everyone else lives in it.  Don’t be a cuck and let your wife or kids be player one if you’re that hardcore into this E-rated game, and don’t reviewbomb a family game as a grown ass adult complaining that you’re stuck on player 2 and have a hard time sharing with people lol."
Average_user,"Mar 30, 2020",7,"Hi, as a 14 year old with two siblings I have a few problems with this game. I have been so hyped for this beautiful game! So when I heard my mum had let us get the game for being good during her stay at the hospital, I was ecstatic! This game is £49.99 and it is worth every penny. It is stunning. The best looking animal crossing game ever. Once downloaded, my brother let me watch him I was so excited seeing him play and I was dying to make my own island. However, I soon realised I couldn't do that. There is a limit of one island to a console. Now I understand the reason. It is a great business technique but it is just unfair. My mum was barely able to afford the one we have now and me and my siblings will not be able to share the one island. It'll cause too much frustration. Resource limitation and progression differentiation is irritating to say the least. Me and my sister won't have the same choices and things that my brother will get because he is the representative. I love animal crossing because it's a chill game. I can take my time and do what I want on my own file. But this makes it impossible to have as much fun as I'd have on New Leaf. I seriously just want to give up and let my brother have his fun and it breaks my heart. In this current time with this pandemic I just wanna go to a deserted island and forget what's is going on since I can't see my friends. But this limitation will tear me and my siblings apart which is not what we need.
I don't want to drag this game because it doesn't deserve that. It has been amazingly developed and it has so many positives! I wish I could give it 10/10 but I can't. This one island per console is too unfair and too expensive. This game is advertised for families with kids and most kids will have siblings who will also want to play the game and that is not including the parents. Now, I don't know about you but my family can't afford 4 switches. I hope Nintendo fix this so I can give it the 10/10 it deserves!"
Johnholl1000,"Mar 30, 2020",4,"It really pains me to give this game a low rating because honestly it does so many things right.  In truth, this game would definitely earn a 9 or 10 out of 10 were it not for one glaring issue.  The fact that the game limits you to one island per console.  This is bad for so many reasons that countless others have already pointed out. Obviously it means that multiple people are limited to sharing a single experience instead of being able to have their own separate adventures.  But that isn’t really why I am so frustrated by this game.  No, actually my fiancé and I were very excited to build our island life together and the idea of sharing this experience was something we were both super excited for.  The real problem is that WE DON’T get to share the same experience together!  That’s because in this game the only person who gets to enjoy the full game is the person that founds the island.   Everyone else is treated as a second class citizen unable to trigger any of the main progression events and relegated to doing only the more tedious chores the game has to offer.  So many of the missions and DIY recipes are locked away to these players.  I could go on about this forever but to keep things brief, this one flaw in game design has single handedly destroyed our desire to play this game that we were so excited to play.  The only half-viable solution seams to be buying another console (and probably another copy of the game).  Now given the recent collapse of society, switch consoles have become exceedingly hard to come by.  But even if that weren’t the case, I still wouldn’t be willing to buy another system because it feels like that was the entire reason the game was designed in this manner. This feels so scummy and is the worst part of this whole situation.  Really hope that the necessary changes get made but I expect they won’t.  Until then my score stands."
Derpderp12345,"Mar 30, 2020",0,One island per switch....which is quite underlying the most ridiculous decision ever made. Not to mention at this time where we are in a crisis. And you want us to buy two SWITCHES just because people want more than one island on a video game...seriously....
SalaciousGoo,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"I made a Metacritic account exclusively to support this wonderful game that so many people seem to misunderstand. Animal Crossing has always been a game where the first person to play has the most control, it has always been the intention to only have one town per console (despite being able to circumvent that in some of the installments), and most importantly, it has NEVER been about ""Progressing the Game"".

Animal Crossing is a virtual playground where you hang out and customize your house, make friends with villagers, fill the museum, and just generally waste time, NOT  get to the next objective. If you can't appreciate a game without clear goals, this isn't the game for you, and that really is okay.  But ""This experience didn't appeal to me personally"" doesn't equate to a 1 or 0 score from an objective standpoint.

The things you can do as Resident Advisor are completely ancillary to the core experience of Animal Crossing as a whole, and if you really can't tolerate asking whoever you share your ENTIRE SWITCH CONSOLE with to share their island with you, maybe you even have to talk to them every couple of days (God forbid) about building a bridge or whatever you are so desperately missing about being Player 1, then guess what? You WILL have to pay the same premium everybody else does to get the same experience.

To cap this off, a HUGE shoutout to people who didn't like the one island system and gave it a fair, measured score based on an incredible game having one thing you personally don't like about it, i.e. 4-6, even a 3 if you just don't like the game. You're the real heroes."
FilletFelines,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"This is without a doubt my favorite Switch game so far. The gameplay is incredibly satisfying and you really can mold your island into just about anything you want it to be. There are only two things I take issue with though-- crafting can be incredibly tedious and it needs a few changes (allow us to craft multiple items at once, skip the low-grade tools if we have the necessary materials for better ones). Secondly, I think allowing players to join you on mystery island expeditions would make the game even more enjoyable. They're fun to play on your own but exploring new islands and finding new materials would be even more exciting with friends."
fbrz,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"While the 1st player can receive tasks and make progress with the story, all the other players have terrible gameplay. Nintendo please fix this by, for instance, alternating the player who Tom Nook gives tasks to. The game is great, but only for a single player."
Pedroperoz,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"Simply terrible local multi-player. My wife plays as the 2nd villager, and she is missing lots of recipes and stays blocked on several tasks throughout the game. Nintendo needs to fix this ASAP"
Green-,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"Was super excited to play this game, but there is only ONE save file per switch. For a console designed for families this ****, you can have up to 8 characters for one island but only ONE island and unless you're the mayor you don't get to make meaningful decisions and if one person collects all of the resources for the day, you'll have to wait until tomorrow to get your own.

I'm super disappointed in Nintendo for such a massive flaw in what would've been a great game. Was bought for the family, but can't be used for the family. Get it if you are the only person planning on playing, otherwise don't."

Then my boyfriend, who created his character before mine, signs on after days of not playing and gets all the opportunities to progress the island along with free diy recipes. Nintendo was NOT upfront about this one true player per game console. I feel scammed out of my time and money. Nintendo needs to fix this."
Colby_Cheese,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"Good game and I can't believe people are giving 0/10 reviews. Me, my brother and my sister all share the same island and we all are having a great time with the game, I stared the island so yes I do have more stuff to do but my siblings have not complained at all and have told me that there glad I decided to get it so basically don't listen to the 0/10s and this is a 100% must buy."

Nyn,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"For me, there's no problem with the unique island ...  i knowed before buying. But, all the players blocked by the first one's progression, it's just a very bad surprise after a few hours of playing for the 5 players of my family. It's the end of the game for 4 of us. For make her happy, we let my 7 years daughter playing first .... critical failure... I'm sorry, but it's my bigger disappointment for the moment."
Niclink_21,"Mar 30, 2020",2,"So far from what I have seen, I am slightly disappointed with this game. I enjoy the new features such as the nookphone and the various quality of life fixes. The new museum looks AMAZING and the graphics look amazing as well. There are, however, many things I am disappointed with. For one, many staple NPCs of the series have been cut. Brewster, Redd, Dr. Shrunk, Harriet, Pelly & Phyllis, and Katrina have all been cut. In addition, the art gallery has been entirely cut from the museum. Nook's Cranny now only has one upgrade. There are very few buildings to construct. The amount of buildings and facilities you construct would be equivalent to the amount of buildings and facilities that would be available day 1 in other games. Diving has been removed and the there are now only 6 different kinds of fruits. I am mixed on crafting. On one hand, crafting provides a new and fun way to create certain furniture and outdoor furniture. On the other hand, If you remove the crafting and the nook miles system from the game, this game would have no substance. I'll just put it this way, this is the first animal crossing game where I have had nothing to do except log in, play the game for a total of 10 mins, and sign out. Each animal crossing game released up to New Horizons was a culmination of everything great from the games previous. This is the first game in the series to regress in design and gameplay and that just doesn't sit well with me. This game was rushed and hopefully, with updates, this game can improve, but for now, this game is all style and no substance, and I'll be sticking to city folk or new leaf."
Danman23,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"It was an enjoyable game for about 3 minutes until I realized that you have no option to make your own island, instead you have to settle for being just another villager on the island of whoever booted up the game first.

If you aren’t the “island representative”, you have absolutely no control over your own experience. You can’t even name the island you’re on or unlock items at your own pace. You aren't playing the game, you’re letting someone else’s experience dictate what you are able to do.

You can’t even buy another copy of the game if you want your own island. No, that’d be too easy. Instead, Nintendo decided that each console is only allowed to have ONE island each. Want your own island? Be ready to pay $360 for another switch and a separate game cartridge. Absolutely ridiculous and nothing but a blatant cash grab."
Nerd012,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"BEWARE OF BUYING! YoU can only have one Island, if you want to have co-op you have to share an Island together. Player one is essessily  the boss."
Chinch07,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an incredible game and I'm so happy it came out at a time when people are locked inside. Even after our current events have subsided I expect to be playing this game for a very long time. No other game has the charm of AC and I just can't wait for what else this game has in store as the seasons change.

I understand many are upset about the limitation of 1 island per console but to review bomb such a great game for this and give it 0,1,2,3/10 is insane. Vent and release your frustration elsewhere if you can't be mature and give an honest rating."
FluffyTurtle123,"Mar 30, 2020",2,This game is fun...... if your the first person to play. If your the second or third or so on player than you are pretty much just a visitor that can do basically  much nothing that affects the island. I understand Nintendo that they want to sell more switches and make more money but you are ruining the game for lots of people. This is not ok.
Pckljoos,"Mar 30, 2020",0,My personal experience of this game was very disappointing. I share a switch my boyfriend and he already started his island a few days before I was able to begin. I am not able to create my own island and I have to live on his. We had completely different experiences of the game right away because he’s in charge of the island and gets to decide everything. I was really looking forward to making my own island but now I’m not even sure if I want to play. I don’t want to be forced to buying a whole new console and game just so I can have the same game play experience as someone else in my Jimenez. Bad design.
Jeronimo1776,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"A MUST own for Nintendo Switch!

By far the most comprehensive and best Animal Crossing experience.

The graphics are great in handheld, but REALLY pop at a level never before seen in docked mode.

The soundtrack is very chill and absolutely WILL get stuck n your head.

This is a very chill game - perfect for all of us stressed out, over worked, and quarantined people!"
innatum,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"One island per console, no matter how many copies of the game are purchased? The pinnacle of greed. You expect low income families with multiple kids to buy multiple Switch’s? Get real."
coltonious,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"Whilst yes, multiplayer is very heavily lacking, that's no reason for the horrible reviews most people are giving it. As a game, let alone an animal crossing game, it is absolutely wonderful full of life and care. As a singleplayer experience, it is absolutely wonderful. I don't honestly understand why people are treating it so poorly for it's same screen multiplayer. While I can admit it's very strange, and not well done, people are treating it as if it is something that has been in every game and was ruined in this game. This is the first time that same screen multiplayer has ever been implemented, so it works alright for what it is. The only thing keeping it from a perfect 10 in my opinion, is the fact that others who live on the island other than the first person to move in, can not place things around the island, only in their own home. This takes away a lot of what this game advertises, and leaves the  game essentially New Leaf + crafting. The game is wonderful, and anyone who needs a life sim or something to help them relax from their stressful life should buy this game."

Twapoi,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"Too many downsides make it not worth the price and a major downgrade from past animal crossing games. It's 2020 already. It is unacceptable that Nintendo still does not do multiple savers per game and offer cloud save services. they need to get out of the past already!

pros: cute graphics

cons:
ONLY ONE TOWN PER GAME. GET OUT OF THE PAST NINTENDO-- LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME COMPANY ON THIS PLANET HAS BESIDES YOU!

No cloud saves (so wait, we just need to waste years on a game with no way to back it up? wait for their low powered console to break?  hahahah how about no)

can't split items stacks
can't bulk craft
tools break too quickly

gold tools are not worth unlocking or crafting! they break too. What's the frikkin point of unlocking them then? there's isn't one! what is it with nintendo and breakable crap anyway? breath of the wild had this stupid problem too. Nintendo just doesn't learn. Shocker.

no paintings, gracy, etc

only 5 catalog items can be bought a day (lol wut)

""mystery"" islands are boring. it's the same island with slightly different layout every time lol. the chance of seeing anything else is slim to none! Not worth it."
Klarel,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"My issues with the game are the lack of any sort of meaningful options menu, the tight unforgiving timing requirements for fishing and certain bug catching, and the shear amount of busywork that the game requires you to do in order to progress. The best ways of making money require a good sense of timing, or those activities can easily take twice as long or longer. I admit, I have a bad sense of timing, but i don't play rhythm games, so why are those types of mechanics showing up in a 'relaxing island getaway.'
I feel that the game has zero respect for player time, i.e. the crafting menu is atrocious, and trying to craft multiple things at once is a nightmare, and players are forced to sit through slow (unchangeable) dialog for most actions they take. Also, the arguably biggest achievement (golden tools) are now mostly useless as they only have about 3x the durability of the previous tools. That's right, the things that take almost a YEAR to unlock are not much better than the middle tier of tools."
Matt1080,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"This game is very fun almost to the point of being addicting. You might be confused by the 0 rating I am giving this, but it is only for one simple reason, which is that you are limited to one island per device. It’s actually ridiculous that any account added after the original one is forced to be on the same island and follow behind the first player in the story. I mean, how difficult is it to just make separate saves for different accounts? I don’t want to have to miss out on the entirety of the main story having to follow behind the main player. Now each player has to compete for resources, land area, everything. The multiplayer option is god awful as well. One player, being the ‘leader’ can play the game normally while the other player is completely helpless. Having a simple fix of a split screen option would fix this so easily. Like please Nintendo, it really doesn’t seem like that hard of an update to fix the atrocious single island and multiplayer design you came up with. I mean whose idea was this anyway? It’s simply the worst multi player system I have seen in literally any game. Every other game on the Switch allows you to have multiple game saves, but this one just **** the fun out of the whole game just because of this design! Please please please please please please fix your horrific  system and allow for multiple game saves (multiple islands) and fix the garbage multiplayer system to make it a split screen, or just remove the feature all together. It really doesn’t seem like that hard of a fix that would benefit the thousands of other players who are complaining about the same issues. Again, the game is really fun, but all that fun goes out the door because of these simple little designs."
dynastyyanks,"Mar 30, 2020",10,This is the most refined and polished Animal Crossing game ever. My girlfriend and I have been playing it obsessively since it came out. I doubt another game this year will bring this much joy.
MYSnoopy88,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"I like the design and new aesthetics of the game, having played all the previous versions, and even though they've kept having 1 island/town throughout the series, it doesn't execute as properly as on a family console device like the switch."
Miertje83,"Mar 30, 2020",1,The limitation of one island per Switch is **** Nintendo should be ashamed of itself....
RetroThunder,"Mar 30, 2020",8,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the best video game in the series in terms of content and features. Something that I love in this game as always in the franchise, is the closeness it has with reality, now more than ever. Time, season (now even choosing in which hemisphere you can place your island) and weather equal to your city's. It also highlights how alive the game is, with dialogues from the neighbors that change continuously (not counting those of the main characters, which are very repetitive) and situations between them, that can make you feel as if you were really inside. Many people are annoyed that there is only one island per console, but not me personally, and that is one of the many characteristics that make the Animal Crossing saga unique. The union and trust between the players who live together in the same space. Despite this, I have to admit that multiplayer on the same console is somewhat messy, since it does not allow the second player to join the game directly and it has to go through a somewhat slow process. In addition to the fact that in order for him to do any minimum action, the first player must change his position as leader, and although it is a simple and fast process, it tires having to do it many times. Still, the control of the character and interface in singleplayer mode is not bad, because I really liked the idea of using a phone as a menu to navigate between the different options. Online mode is better than I expected and is an example of how multiplayer should be on the same console, although the transition between when the visitor arrives on the island and when he leaves can be repetitive when you connect many times with friends, but it is still pretty (somewhat long). As a conclusion, I can affirm that each new day on the island feels fresh and eager to start, although progress can feel slow but satisfactory. The new playable crafting and construction features can appeal to both veteran and new players alike, and graphically as well as musically it is very, very good. I am enjoying and having fun with this game and I hope to finish it completely because I liked it a lot, and it is not that it has exceeded my expectations because it was just what I expected but I do not regret buying it at all, it is highly recommended and I assure that those who play it will like it a lot."
dognus,"Mar 30, 2020",1,I bought this game to play with my daughter who is new to video games. She played first and then I was expecting to join with my own character and help her out. Not possible because the game only lets the person who plays first progress through the game. I can’t do anything useful to help her and I’m basically playing pared down “demo” of the game rather than having my own experiences progressing in the game. This should not have been sold as a “multiplayer” game because it’s only one person who plays all other accounts basically sit around and wait for the other player’s progression if they progress at all. I’m not going to delete my daughter’s island and start over. Really hoping an update balances the players’ abilities in the game. Very disappointed.
ACNHScam,"Mar 30, 2020",1,Scummy practice limiting local multiplayer to one fun experience and then a second class experience for anyone else who wants to play on that console. Solid effort by Nintendo limiting a user's experience to try and force people to purchase an entirely new console just to play a a game they purchased in its full capacity. Won't work on me.
KaseyC555,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"We literally only bought a switch so we could play animal crossing. Now it turns out we just wasted 400 dollars to be screwed over yet again by Nintendo, a game company who solely thrives on ruining the experience of its users and completely controlling everything they can get there hands on. The fact that you can only have one island per console is absolutely ridiculous. I even called support to see if they were going to fix this issue and I was told to just buy another switch since the main issue with the game isn’t going to be resolved. Thanks Nintendo for ruining another game, yet again. 0 stars."
Millet,"Mar 30, 2020",8,"If rate this game a 7.5 but going with 8 because of so many unfair reviews here. My critiques:
1) There are less fruit & shop varieties than NL. I wish nooks could be upgraded past a shed in this game.
2) storage system could really be optimized in several ways-at least as an ""unlock"" feature. Could use a lot more storage space overall. But things like letting work benches store materials, or having ways to access storage outside of your home would be great quality of life features that don't exist right now.
3) wish the map had a villager & visitor key/tracker since the island is (nicely!) Big. Hard to find anyone tho.
4)I miss being able to unlock services to hire people to water plants and deweed for me in the end game. I miss the being able to select building projects and have villagers occasionally help submit bells for the cause.
5) NL had games you could play with your villagers randomly and have events where they'd either invite you over or request to hang out with you in your home..I have many hours in and haven't seen this. (They'd also be willing to part with furniture and such)

To be clear, ACNH *added* many features but also took away some that I enjoyed. The #1 issue with this game is you can only have one island per switch ...youd have to buy an entirely different system if you have more than one person who wants to play their own file. I don't see this restriction on any other switch game I own so this feels very dissapointing as a decision even if it doesn't apply to my household situation. The switch system is pricey and families probably were caught off guard by this.

I still love this game and am enjoying it. The new features I won't spoil are great."

Tarynbethp,"Mar 30, 2020",2,"I bought this game for my daughter and I to play. I've been a long time Animal Crossing player, and I got her started on the franchise as soon as she was old enough to play. We had both been anticipating the game for months. I let her start the game and enjoy it for a few days before I logged into my switch profile and started my game. I was extremely disappointed to see that it put me on my daughter's island, and I can participate as a glorified visitor. I cannot progress the game in any way. If she collects all the fruit before me for the day, I cannot gather any. As a secondary player, you can basically decorate a house, and interact with the environment, but nothing further. I understand that even if you buy another came card, you cannot have your own island. The only way to do that is to spend $200-$300 for an additional Switch console. And another $60 for a second game copy if you want to play together or at the same time. Seems like a big money grab from Nintendo to sell more Switch consoles. Extremely disappointed!"

Chromatica21,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"First of all, I understand that people have problems with the multiplayer. That should definitely be fixed, and it makes sense that people are upset. However, in my personal experience, this game is amazing.

I basically live in Animal Crossing: New Horizons nowadays. It's a simple but fantastic game. The multiplayer is definitely flawed, but the rest of the game has so much content and has so much to do at all times. It's basically Animal Crossing, but in a completely different setting and with crafting, which makes it so much more interesting than the older games. The multiplayer is the only flaw that really affects what I think of the game, and the rest of it is fine-tuned to perfection."
AngryGamerDude,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"Nintendo's most agregious cash grab and violation of consumer trust to date.  For each player you need a separate game AND SWITCH console, otherwise the non primary resident (ie: literally second class citizens) are unable to participate in most of the content.

You imagine I would still give the game some points for the game play the primary citizen can participate in, however the game was mainly purchased for the family, meaning those the game was intended for are unable to participate in any meaningful way, so..

I really wanted to enjoy this animal crossing game but we both can't have our own game on one console and now I can't get crafting recipes for certain things like bridges, NPC buildings, or contribute in any way to our town other than collecting resources and giving them to her.

Nintendo has given this game a massive design flaw and I'm honestly really disappointed with how it turned out."
Yelaned,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"I was really looking forward to this game, however after I did the intro and gave the switch to my boyfriend to play, we found out that it is one island, and that island's resources (so since I had gone through the efforts of doing everything before switching off he had nothing to do) shared per switch. Made the game play really ineffective and if I could return it I would. I don't enjoy the game now as it is more of a ""who gets to play today"" rather than a fun thing we get to do."

Bulldad,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE

I am forced to rate this game very low because of the egregious pricing caused by a limitation put on this game. The limitation of only being able to have ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE. Every other game i have i can share with others in my household. As it currently stands I have to purchase a new console and game per island at a minimum of $400 per save file. On top of this there is no cloud save functionality.

I would happily rate this game a 9 if this wasn't the case but as it stands family's with multiple children are forced to not buy the game or buy multiple switches so each person has the option to play the same game, a requirement that does not exist for any other game I am aware of on any home console.

If these two issues are rectified I will update the review score to a 9"
Pbee,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"Really Nintendo? You have allowed the switch to hold several accounts. You promoted switch as a family console, and you decide to restrict one island per switch?

My wife and I had a blast with Pokemon, being able to enjoy our play throughs separately but still had that sense of camaraderie in Pokemon Home. I want to give this game a 9. I really did enjoy every moment in game, but its almost game breaking when you have another person wanting to play but has to literally take a back seat.

Soda1992,"Mar 30, 2020",0,"This game is down right terrible. Complete laziness by the designers and then locked to one island per switch where only the first person to create a profile can fully advance the island and enjoy the game is a disgusting ploy that feels like they are just trying to sell consoles. The laziness comes about not even having a proper 3rd person camera. I would let some of this slide if it was a 20 dollar game at most. I have played free mobile games with better physical control design and options than. It's a cheap game at a high price to try and trick consumers into buying another console to fully enjoy it. When the game falls so flat on its face it would never be worth buying another switch to maybe enjoy it. I hope to God I can return it to Wal-Mart tomorrow
The one game a year I buy for my birthday I budget specifically for I am going to pissed if I am stuck with this dumpster fire."
xenomachina,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"The Nintendo Switch has one of the best profile systems of any game console. Each player can have their own profile, and games saves are kept completely separate.

Because of this, I was very surprised to discover that Animal Crossing: New Horizons goes out of its way to circumvent the profile system. The first player to play the game is given the full experience. All other players are given a downgraded experience. Parts of the game are just missing, like naming your island, or choosing its layout. Progress in the game for all players is also gated by the primary player's progress. And all players are forced to have the same island, with limited space and limited resources.

If I'd known this, I wouldn't have purchased this game, as we have one Switch shared by two kids. How is it fair to let one of them be the ""island representative"", while the other is treated as a second-class citizen by the game?

Searching online I see others trying to excuse Nintendo's behavior here, saying ""Animal Crossing has always been like that"", but:

1. This is false. On the 3DS you could only have one game save per cartridge, but you could use multiple cartridges with a single 3DS. On the Switch you need two separate consoles.

2. When classic games with limited save slots are ported to the Switch, the number of save slots from the original are normally made *per-profile* on the Switch. For example, in Link's Awakening there are only 3 save slots. In the Switch version, there are 3 save slots *per-profile*. Likewise, one would expect that Animal Crossing would have one game save *per-profile* on the Switch.

3. Having mis-features in the past is not an excuse for propagating them into the future.

Nintendo went out of their way to make the game terrible for anyone but the first player. It's pretty clear that their motivation for this is greed. Instead, they've made me strongly consider returning this game, and avoiding their platform in the future."

Go to bench and select craft something. 2. Select the recipe you want to craft 3. See a cute animation for crafting 4. Have your character exclaim they made the thing you told them to and 5. select craft something else.  Repeat as many times as you plan to craft, and this game is getting 10's?  Its good but no 10.

The single player game is non existent for the second player on the island. Then I thought, ok at least co-op should be good. But no co-op game is also pretty bad experience.

2. Only the ""Resident Manager"" (first player to start the game) can progress the story. This doesn't jive with #1.
3. Tools break. Fine. Fishing rods break. Okay... Watering cans break. Wait what?
4. Cannot create multiple tools at once. This doesn't jive with #3.
5. A little confirmation and animation plays for every single thing that's made. This doesn't jive with #4.
6. Flowers need to be dug up now in order to be moved, using a shovel that, oh boy, it breaks. Again this would be more acceptable if it weren't for #5 and #4, but now it's just a pain in the ass.
7. You can cross rivers using a stick! Cool, but first you gotta equip it. Why not just make it automatic with some unused button? Because it's gotta be a chore.
8. You can climb cliffs using a ladder! Cool, but first you gotta equip it. Why not just make it automatic with some unused button? Because it's gotta be a chore.

This game is a goddamn chore to play after the first day or two. This is mostly due to the new DIY mechanic and the ungodly amount of steps required to gather materials, make tools that break in 5-10 minutes of use, traverse the terrain, etc. Are chores fun? Not normally, no, but the professional reviewers seem to think chores are a blessing. This game, unlike previous titles in the franchise, feels like a tedious chore. Do you like chores?

And hoo boy that friend visiting wait time, good god. 1-2 minutes of waiting, when downloading the data of a friend's island would take, at most, 2-3 seconds on any halfway-decent connection. Why was this added? It's fine to see once, but every single time? Five friends visiting each other's islands will lead to everyone waiting for at least 25 minutes in total, sitting there, doing absolutely nothing. It blows my mind that somebody thought ""Hell yeah, great idea, let's make them wait more."""

marveljp,"Mar 29, 2020",0,Being the second player of the console is the worst. Not enjoying at all the game
animalcross,"Mar 29, 2020",0,1 island per console breaks the game. The switch is supposed to be a home console shared by the household. This is a terrible experience. No one should have to spend another $300 on an additional switch to enjoy the game to its fullest with a partner/friend. Boo Nintendo. Boooooo.
LTGuu,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"Horrible 2nd player limitation and relationship breaker for Switch with shared users fighting for who will be the Owner and loser be a second class citizen/refugee with almost no fun.
As a new Animal Crossing player this is such a disappointment."
brownieman182,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"So bad. So boring. You do absolutely nothing. Bought this for my 6 year old, he was the second user, could do very little as all limited to main user. Tried to remove me, but had to delete ALL saved data (for both) in order to do that."
illiahn,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"The game itself? Fun, BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE ONE PERSON. If there is more than one person in your household who wants to play this, you have to buy a SEPARATE CONSOLE ENTIRELY for them to play on their own island.

Incredibly disappointing. Just another way to gouge people for money."
Jcd2210,"Mar 29, 2020",0,Local multiplayer is just a slap in the face. One island per switch is a sinful money grab on Nintendo’s part. Do not get this game if you intend to share it with other members of your household!
Guiermo,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"This is our families very first time playing Animal crossing. There are 5 people in our family they love to play on the switch. During this time of being quarantined in our home, we thought this would be a great game for the kids to take their mind off of what’s going on in the world. The 5 year was the first to play the game, not knowing really how to read, he simply clicked through things and just started running around the island having a blast.  After that every other person in family played on their own users. We realized that we were all located on the same island. No big deal we thought. We each played for a few hours, but none of us could figure out how to make an axe. None of us had the option. After several frustrating searches we found out that since the 5 year old started the game first, he is the only one that can really play the game. Meaning that no one on the switch can make any decisions.  We had to delete all the saved data for everyone and start fresh on 1 user. This is unacceptable. The switch is meant to be a console with multiple players. Every other 1st Party Nintendo has a separate save system for each users own progression. Mario Kart, Zelda, Smash Bros."
Jhoteria,"Mar 29, 2020",4,"I love this game but cannot with good conscience give it a great score. The one island per switch decision stinks of corporate greed. If you’re going to limit the island at least do it per game copy. So people are encouraged to buy copies of the game, but as it stands this is just terrible consumer practices."
knuffel,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"I am second player on the console ... means like i am only a Player Guided Character having the same options as NPCs ... oh wait no, they have more options as i am. Nice! I love to be an NPC and only running around and doing nothing!

First player on the Island has normal game, and can make EVERY descission, i can do nothing of these! No house building, na gifts for me, no progress! Lovely!"
raihidara,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"My wife loved Animal Crossing back in the day, so I bought this for her. Our son wanted to play too, and we saw there was multiplayer so we figured this would be fun to play as a family.

This is quite possibly the worst multiplayer videogame in existence. What's that, son? You want to play by yourself? Don't have too much fun now, because you will ruin the game for everyone else, leaving them with nothing to do and an empty shell of an experience. Oh yeah, also you don't get to play any further in the game until your mom logs in to advance the game, has one brief moment of enjoyment, and then you proceed to ruin the game all over again. It's not his fault that he wants to play a game to have fun. It's Nintendo's.

The lack of multiple save files and a separate multiplayer mode is one of the worst decisions I've ever seen, and I believe they didn't even playtest it. Either that or they honestly, amd stupidly, thought most people had two Switch systems or would buy another. I'll change my review if this ever gets patched, but until then, this game is one of the least enjoyable of all time. No hyperbole."
Slumber112,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"Don’t be fooled by the “8 player” tag at the top. This is a single player game, anyone else living on your island can’t do anything but fish and improve their house. If your not player one you literally can’t do anything on the island. What the hell nintendo at least give us the option to change who is the main person. Was loving the game but now I can’t even play it."
aixyu,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"The game itself is pretty nice. But its one-island per switch system is just stupid. I let my roommate get his animal crossing account first because he seemed really excited for the game. However, now my switch is tied down to his account, and I can't play on my own island. Quite a big issue for me because I will be graduating soon and will have to take my switch. Then will all his progress become mine? It is quite disgusting how Nintendo is making people who want more islands to purchase another switch. Quite greedy and I hope they fix this issue soon as I have two copies on my switch, but won't start my second copy as you can't create your own game."
Hyael,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"A BIG 0, like many other users for the multisave problem. I bought the game for my sister, hoping i could play with her, but I just can't bring myself to just play literally half of the game (And force her to play half of it, even if it was a gift), which I bought 60$ because of a feature it should have.

For anyone that was going to review positively this game, even if you are not affected by this problem, I ask of you to be considerate for the other part of the players that can't fully enjoy the game and lower your score."

czearing,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"If you plan on having multiple users playing this game, DONT BUY IT. For whatever reason the original creator of the island is only given access to progressing in the game. Every other user that plays is purely cosmetic and has no purpose in playing as they cannot progress. This ridiculous feature needs to be patched in a future update as it literally ruins the game for everyone except the registered users."

Jibber9811,"Mar 29, 2020",9,"More fun than I had anticipated. Haven't played an Animal Crossing since the GC and DS. I appreciate all the changes they've made to allow to a better flowing game.

If you're a fan of the series, I highly recommend it."
Traveldude189,"Mar 29, 2020",0,The game literally has no long term objectives local multiplayer is horrible especially since you cant purchase a second switch anywhere. The fact that most of the game is acquiring clothing and furniture for a house i dont ever care to expand and i have to wait months and months in real to get new bugs or fish is just insane. Ive never traded in a game before or sold it but this one definitely takes the cake.
yongkit,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"I have to quit playing because my family is ruining my experience. I'm the superfan who went out of my way to buy the limited edition console and preorder the game, launch it at midnight to start my island. In all the previous entries, excluding New Leaf, I shared towns with my family members over the decades of my upbringing. I understand why there's only one island per switch. Truly, I get it. For purposes of game manipulation, etc. Plus it keep the player's attachment to the island, since you can't make a new one without having to sacrifice the progress you've already made. They've done this in all the other entries! So it makes sense, of course. However, this is not the Animal Crossings that have come before. It offers endless customization. So how can I enjoy my island when my casual gamer family members are constantly ruining my island? With tires all over the land, hoarding the star fragments, buying all the items, giving animals random items to put in their homes, their own homes are ugly, their coordination is unbelievably bad, items everywhere, trash everywhere. I'm the only one working during this global pandemic, as well as a full time student. I want to spend an hour or two a day taking care of my island but when I get there, everything's already done or so horribly ruined that I can't bare to play. I can't believe I bought this and I bought a console just to play this. It's honestly damaging my relationship with my family and causing me to have even more negative feeling during this hard time. I'm so upset with Nintendo and they need to patch the game to fix it."
Bwheat204,"Mar 29, 2020",4,Really enjoyed playing the game until I found out about all the restrictions for 2nd players. It does not bother me that the representative gets to choose placement of things but we should all be able to contribute and progress the story/town and receive the special items the representative gets.
Kwar,"Mar 29, 2020",10,I understand what a lot of people are saying regarding the inability to make more than one Island on a console. But for me I'm the only one using my console and there is no doubt that this game is a 10 for me. It's absolutely gorgeous. There's so many things to do. And it's so relaxing. The interesting thing is that Nintendo said many moons ago that this game was only going to have one Island per console. This news is not new.

neon_island,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"They purposely create problems only to try and sell you solutions later!
You cannot backup your save files in any capacity that doesn't involve giving Nintendo MORE money than the roughly $260-$360 you spent in total just getting the game!
They lock your save file TO THE SWITCH! This means you can only have ONE island PER CONSOLE! As if that isnt bad enough, if your Switch breaks you arpotential hours you spent playing will just be GONE unless you pay an additional $20 a year for cloud saving. Which who knows how long the lifespan of that could be in 4 years..."
JohnWick269,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"Great game with one crippling flaw that makes it near unplayable. One island per switch is either an inexplicable oversight or a shameless cash grab. The first person to set up the island is the only player that can progress the story and do anything significant to the island making it a pedestrian and boring experience for any other player playing on the same switch. Please Nintendo, either allow for co-proprietary rights between players on the same island or allow for one island per individual player. My wife started our island and I feel like an NPC when I’m playing because I can’t build houses, progress the story mode, or many other fundamental features of the game that make it what it is. The $60 price point is only worth it for the original creator of the island, while any other players on the same switch are not allowed access to $60 worth of features."
fraser5267373,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"Bridge building mechanic is complete trash and unusable until terraforming is unlocked. Please fix this nintendo, I’m shocked that you released a game so broken.

Make the bridges less finicky so that they’re actually usable."
Regillix,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"Issues with additional players on the switch being restricted from much of the progression in the game really spoils the experience in this game.  I sure hope they add patches to fix this.  Until than, this game is definitely a pass."

LordOMO,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"This game doesn't deserve its high review score as it is unplayable for anyone with more than one user per system.
The game doesn not, I repeat, DOES NOT allow for individual save states. And it doesn't allow for Cloud saves or exporting save states to other consoles.
This means that, as it happened in my case, you may forever be a mere visitor in your own Island.
A Family member started playing the game before me and is therefor by default the main account. Everyone else, including me, is just a simple resident with a lot of handicaps compared to the main account.
This is a game about developing your own town on a deserted island yet everyone except the main account practically has NO SAY IN HOW THE ISLAND SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.
Therefor the game is unplayable and absolutely deserves zero points.
This might have been a fun game IF I HAD THE CHANCE TO ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THE GAME.
Go to hell Nintendo. I'm so sad and angry and disappointed. There isn't even a way to export a save file so I can't even throw everyone else off the island and start over."
EchtSchwarmi,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"If you are the only player or the first player to boot up the game, you will enjoy a polished lonely island experience with crafting and cute characters.

Tyler797,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"1. No transferring islands and characters to another Switch.
2. Co-op is a joke and not fun.
3. No option to have multiple islands per Switch.
4. Only the first account to move into the island will have the full experience. While the rest of people that move into the island can’t do anything to contribute to the progress the island. And will have to wait for the lead islander to do everything.
5. What’s with the removal of the gyroids?

I got this game to share and build a island together with my girlfriend, but I can’t without buying a second Switch. This game is great fun (alone), but these greedy intentional practices need to stop."
Avasond,"Mar 29, 2020",4,Really a great game but I can't give ita positive rating until multiplayer is fixed. My boyfriend would ruin my island!
frafgogg,"Mar 29, 2020",4,"Look alright, I really hope someone at Nintendo is reading these and taking notes because one island per console isn't what destroys the experience of the game for me, no, it's the fact that player two is shackled down to player one's progress. As soon as started playing the game I realized this was a huge problem. I heard on Reddit that the second player's progress was only limited to the FIRST WEEK of gameplay and low and behold its been 8 days and I'm disappointed I still can't build bridges or inclines or, y'know, progress the story in any way shape or form. This is absolutely disgusting from a 60 dollar triple A title. I'm either forced to sit and wait for my sister to progress and make big decisions without my input, or log on to her account and progress the game and make big decisions without her input. I'm really sad about it to be honest and I hope this whole situation gets fixed somewhere although it probably won't."
davrich,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"My wife and I were soooo looking forward to playing this game, and when she started I thought it was great. But when I went to start my own game and realized I couldn't have my own island, also that my functions were limited on her island, the game was absolutely ruined for me. I cannot justify buying another switch just to play this game"
Deorka,"Mar 29, 2020",4,"It is sad to realize that a lot is done for money, to sell switch again and again.

Even if the game present some new features (in 2020 wow...) you can't enjoy the full experience;

In one hand because the ""story-line"" or the building progression can evolve only with the ""island's owner"" (the first player) and so all the others need to wait...

In the second hand because when you play as a couch coop player (i don't know for the online multiplayer) you are restricted, you cannot open your inventory and cannot use crafting, well, you can ""switch"" to be leader and recover these things but this is boring...

And I don't talk about the lack of more interactions with object

So in the end, even if you accept the fact that there will be just one island in the console you have to face 2 major problems that constantly remind you that Nintendo WANT money

It really affect the multiplayer experience so for me the new features are cool but the restriction **** too much
And it is sad to see that a lot of ""critic reviews"" are willfully blind"
Amaranthh,"Mar 29, 2020",0,Local multiplayer and one island per console just shows how greedy Nintendo has become.
amanimini,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"I'm an Animal Crossing superfan, and because of that alone I'm enjoying this game a lot. HOWEVER, my score is simply because I don't think this game should be rewarded for how much it fails to deliver. The one island per console thing was bad enough, but then on top of that, your subsequent user accounts have a limited experience in the game too. Only one person gets to have the full Animal Crossing experience and that's awful for a family game. It goes far beyond that as well, though. So many of the features, items, and even signature characters from previous games have been completely taken away in this. There's some reviews on this page that list most of these things that were taken out, but the point is, this game feels unfinished and rushed. The good news is: Nintendo can definitely fix this with updates, DLC, and general fixes. The bad news is... I'm not so sure they'll actually do it. I can see them adding in *some* of the missing features, but I'll have to wait and see if they'll actually make this feel like a finished game and fix the issue of multiple people wanting their own island. I wouldn't even mind paying for the game again to have another island. For now, though, it feels incomplete and a bit unsatisfying for a huge Animal Crossing fan."
Rossilaz,"Mar 29, 2020",10,"The best Animal Crossing has ever been. It's truly a massive upgrade from the past entries in the series, and adds a whole lot of new content. It may have a slow start, but eventually it picks up and shows where it really shines.

I understand the issue that the people who are Review-Bombing this game have, which is that you can only have one save game per system. Personally, I play this alone so i'm fine with it. Animal Crossing has never been a multiplayer experience, anyway. Sure, it's had online multiplayer in the older entries, but the game is mainly single player. It's also never been possible to have more then one town without buying new cartridges before, so i don't see the issue."
jennaleigh0,"Mar 29, 2020",4,"Multiplayer ****. It really makes it hard to enjoy the game when you bought it to play with your partner and the second player is so limited it is boring. It makes sense for children sharing the game with one being too young to make decisions but feels ridiculous and a waste of money for adults to play. And don't get me started on the one island per console problem (eye-roll).

**** Valley makes Nintendo look lazy and money-hungry for putting this out and marketing it as multiplayer. The animation is cute though and I really hope Nintendo beefs up multiplayer."
whoaskedhim,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"I share a Switch with my fiancée and we bought this game knowing about the co-op and single-island-per-console restrictions, but we were naive about just how much these restrictions would affect gameplay. In every possible way, Nintendo has designed this game to be a single-player experience. Just sharing the same island sounded bearable, but it turns out that EVERYTHING in this game has to be shared, zero-sum style. All the daily spawning resources? Only one player can take advantage of them per day. All the first-time awards for donating or developing the island? Only one player get the rewards. If one player happens to play the game more often than any other sharing the same console, there will be very little gameplay left to enjoy for the others. Nintendo has done this purposefully, betting that the pain inflicted on the players would be enough to justify buying more hardware and game copies. In our case, it has just soured us on their brand. Shame."
maniacalmermaid,"Mar 29, 2020",9,"This game is absolutely incredible! As a long-time fan of animal crossing, I have played every game since the GameCube. It is incredible to see how far the series has come! The graphics themselves have truly made the game franchise and villagers come to life! No detail left unnoticed, from the way the rain drops on the water to the way the wind sways in the trees. This game is truly a beautiful escape during such an unfortunate time in history. Even my husband who hasn’t been interested in previous games is hooked to this one. The crafting is addictive, and “Nook miles” objectives keep you playing for hours on end. This game is truly a masterpiece and I can tell there was a LOT of time spent on this game by the developers! Even the dialogue is simply fantastic. I haven’t seen such awesome dialog since the GameCube says. To all of those upset about the “one island per switch”, that is how every game has been except for the GameCube (one town per memory card). I don’t think it warrants a negative review whatsoever because it’s not a feature that has been taken away recently from the series. If that’s the case, where are the negative reviews for new leaf, city folk, and wild world?? My only small beef with the game (and why it’s 9/10) is that it is missing a large handful characters from previous games. Reese, Cyrus, Cappin’, Rover, Pelly, Porter, etc. are no where to be seen. If you are a long time fan of the series, you will definitely feel their lack of presence. There are new characters enrolled to fill the spots of some characters yet to make an appearance. However, hopefully with future updates they will return for an event or possibly dlc!"

Elmeromero,"Mar 29, 2020",8,"I haven’t played animal crossing since the game cube and all I remember was shaking trees, getting stung by bees and making my 10 year old dream house. The formula has changed surprisingly little but I have put in over 30 hours in just a week so you could say I’m addicted. I love the crafting and fishing. When I boot up the game I never have a plan but end up playing for hours. It **** that you can’t have more than one island per console but my wife is fine to play a little here and there while I take main control so it doesn’t affect us as much but I do feel sorry for those players who want to have two islands on one console. I’ve really liked this game and would recommend it to anyone with a switch. For me, breath of the wild and Mario Odyssey are a perfect 10, smash is a 9, then I’d put Mario kart, Mario maker and Animal Crossing new horizon as an 8. Just as a point of reference, ya know?"
Foundation982,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"I recently purchased this game and got pretty farby myself. My wife Wanted to play as well and start and island together. So I started my game over let her start the island.

After hours of playing I could not figure out why on my account I could not build the museum how I did previously. My wife plays but not as much as I do, had I know. i’d be limited I would have set my character up first. Regardless she’s annoyed that we both have to start over again after several hours of gameplay and after restarting she has no interest in the game and we’re both extremely annoyed that we can’t build an island together. Rather its one player building it and another person is just along for the ride.

Pretty lame, after all of this starting over multiple times its getting difficult to find enjoyment in the game."
Mik540,"Mar 29, 2020",2,"I saw all the great reviews for this game so bought it for my wife and me to enjoy. I really enjoyed getting into this game but it all fell apart when my wife logged in to have a go. She tells me we have to share an island which I thought must be wrong! It's a modern 21st century game so multiple  ave files are surely standard. **** meant that I couldn't collect resources she had collected to progress my game.
I completed a mission on my next go and she then couldn't enjoy the mission in her own time. This now feels like chore to enjoy the game.
As such I have deleted my data so she can enjoy the game at her own pace. Unfortunately I can't return this game for a refund, which would be my ideal solution, as it was a digital download.
Fingers crossed for a patch to fix this poor decision"
vestafan88,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"I want to preface this by saying that I have few issues with the game itself. There are some unnecessarily repetitive mechanics that I think should be addressed, but nothing hugely out of character with the AC universe.

But, the inability to have more than one island per save OR to back up your save to the cloud is baffling. This is an immediate issue for households playing together, and a huge issue going forward knowing how fragile Switch systems are. I purchased a new Switch Lite specifically for this game! A week in, and my joycons are broken, despite absolutely babying the console. If I purchase another console, I've lost 40+ hours of gameplay. Repairs are a no-go at this moment. I am sure there are so many others in this situation, and it's ridiculous. I don't have an unlimited budget to throw at Nintendo.

I feel like the negative reviews are necessary for Nintendo to actually take notice and respond."
Jlab1974,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"Selling this game for $60 and limiting to 1 island per console is outright robbery! How can you claim this game as a social experience when only one person has the full power? Who designed this game, a Dictator? My family has owned our Switch since launch and it’s become a major part of our family time. This game has ruined that. My kids have resorted to undermining each other. They sneak off with the switch and hoard all the resources. This results in screaming, crying, and fighting. How dare you restrict this game in this way! I have never seen such blatant greed. If there are any lawyers out there interested in taking up a class action lawsuit please do! Or maybe just maybe the developers can just update the game to allow creating one island per profile so everyone can experience in full what the game has to offer."
Hazmatbrigade,"Mar 29, 2020",9,"The  game is beautiful, and arguably thus far the most relaxing title in the series thus  far. Most negative user reviews are complaining about something that has been true since the days of the Gamecube release (though technically, the GC game was limited by needing another physical memory card, not another console). The game allows for only 1 town/village/island per console. This facilitates sharing an island with your family, but removes the ability for each person to be in charge of their own island. This *can* be a deal breaker for some people."
MGSplayer1,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"The game is lovely. It is adorable when it can be, and frustrating when it has to be (I'm looking at you, fishes). Some game improvements make the experience much better than the games before it and some fixes need to be made like crafting items in stacks and buying multiple items at once in some sort of catalogue type of system like in Dragons Dogma.

However, there is one major issue that will result in a protest rating of 1 until it gets resolved and that is the 1-island-per-switch rule. The irony that a family console with a game about family is tearing families apart because of the restriction is baffling. The greed that Nintendo has shown recently is making it so that their image is heavily tarnished. You have YouTubers calling it out, you have review sites calling it out, you have gamers on Metacritic calling it out. There is no winning out of this and if they would like to see the rating of the game that is deserving of an 8 or higher they need to address the issue and either release a patch that makes it so separate accounts can have different islands, or succumb to the fall of the rating of the game they worked hard on.

Make your choice, Nintendo. There is only one way you can win this and ignoring it will ensure that you lose."
ChaiPea,"Mar 29, 2020",3,"This is my first time playing an Animal Crossing game. I watched some streams and videos of it, and got excited and intrigued enough that I wanted to try it out. I let my husband start it out first while I did some other things, only to realize that there is only one island allowed per Switch console. I could deal with that- we could have fun organizing an island together- but I can't progress the game or make any decisions about building on the island. It defeats the purpose of why I wanted the game to begin with. I'd even consider buying another copy of the game if I could get my own island, but that's not an option either.

I'm really disappointed, and I guess I'm just not going to play it until my husband gets tired of it. I don't think I'll buy another Animal Crossing game at this point."

Now comes the funny part since my wife had so much fun in the game she played much more than me untill we noticed that only the represantive can do the main things so long story short we had to delete the savegame and start over with my wife as represantive since she plays more than me."

rookfire,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"The good is as most people say: the graphics and audio are amazing, some things are more convenient. I agree with all of it so I'm just going to focus on the bad.

The bad:
- There is WAY too little content for a $70 game. Half of the characters seem to have been axed (Brewster, Katrina, the dream suite, Leif, Gracie, the aplacas...). I kept thinking, 'Is this it? Is this all there is to the game?' when I realized that the last character to unlock was KK Slider.
- Needing the Nintendo Switch Online paid subscription to: 1) online play, 2) use QR codes. This is just really unfair.
- The increased number of tools. There are way too many tools. I'm of the opinion that a good game has one or two key dynamics and builds around that. But there are so many tools in ACNH that it becomes cumbersome when playing.
- DIY CRAFTING OF TOOLS. I effing hate this. Every tool breaks, even golden tools. Then what is the benefit of getting a golden tool? In ACNL, each tool upgrade gave a benefit that made sense in the game. The gold bug net has an increased radius so you can catch rare bugs that startle when you get too close, the golden watering can waters more flowers... There isn't even a way to tell if the tool is close to breaking.
- The constant grinding for materials. Because tools break, half my playtime is spent gathering materials. This has a few problems: 1) distracts from gameplay, 2) materials are almost as important as bells coz you need them to craft a variety of things, 3) at least 5-6 spaces in my inventory are wasted on holding materials, negating the increased inventory size
- The mileage programme. Like above, it distracts from the game coz in essence you have a bunch of meaningless and repetitive side-quests to do just so you can grind for quite a meager amount of miles (e.g. selling 10 seashells for about 200 miles). Also hate that the island ticket is paid for by mileage
- I really hate the new island mechanic. There are no tours, which makes it boring. When there is multiplayer, there's nothing to do. The islands also no longer reliably spawn sharks and rare bugs.
- Very difficult to grind for bells now. In New Leaf, a reliable way of getting money was through the money rock/the ore rock and the island, or the Bell Boom town ordinance (where are the ordinances, by the way?). The money rock gives less money now, there is no ore rock, the island no longer spawns rare stuff. Most items also have inflated prices. Flower seeds used to be 80 bells, now it's 240 bells.
- Paying bells to send letters. Seriously? Why on earth did someone think this was a good idea? Animal Crossing is about a sense of community that you create in the new island/town you move to. The letter system really gave a sense that you were writing to your villagers and they'd write back and send presents. Also, the villagers don't write back.
- THE VILLAGERS. They have way blander personalities. They no longer ask you to change their catchphrase, ask you to run silly errands and run up to you and pester you for something in your inventory. Their dialogue options are incredibly repetitive, where each villager seems to repeat the same 2-3 lines. Even the cute little animations are very repetitive.
- Having only 1 island per console. The local co-op system also is **** [link omitted per rules]
- Why isn't there an icon on my map for other players who are here?
- The merchants. Why is Kicks a wandering merchant instead of having an unlockable shop? Why is the furniture selection at T&T so small, and why can it only be upgraded once? Why isn't there the option to VIEW the wallpaper and flooring I want to buy, in the shop itself, before I buy it?
- Only being able to order 5 things from the catalogue. Why the ****

TLDR: the game is very beautiful and instagrammable, with some convenient upgrades, but it is mainly incredibly lacking in content, it is repetitive and restrictive, resulting in quite a frustrating gameplay experience. I am still playing because I love decorating and customizing, but it is incredibly unsatisfying."

JeibuKul,"Mar 29, 2020",6,"I think it is a good game, having played some of the other animal crossings, I think people who play solo just don't realize how bad the multiple player is. You can't buy a second game to have your own island, you can't use a separate game card to have your own island, you can only buy another switch and another game. My family has one switch, three people, no problems with any other game, but the thing is if one person completes something neither of the other two get to experience it at all. You can NOT get the full game experience if multiple people share a switch. It is a horrible design flaw. The switch is a home console, not a single person game device. I do not think the developers thought this through enough and need to fix it."
Rhode,"Mar 29, 2020",1,"I NEVER play games, I just have alot of other hobbies. My bf convinced me to buy it together since we could play together. Turns out since im the 2nd player that theres a whole lot of stuff I can't do as a 2nd player which makes it way less exciting to play.
I hope they will fix it, because the game overall seems fun and I did put in half of the money! I think thats the case for a lot of people who bought this together."
Sparkyc10,"Mar 29, 2020",2,"I bought this game exclusively for the local multiplayer so I could play with my fiancée and I couldn't have been more disappointed. There's clearly a decent game in there but it's completely ruined by a clumsy local multiplayer system that involves one player being the 'leader' and the other player being utterly worthless. The game allows you to switch leader on the fly but the whole thing just becomes a confusing mess. ""Who is the leader? Oh, you are. Let's switch so I can pick up this item. Okay. Now let's switch back so can open my inventory and give you this other item. Okay, you've picked it up. No, wait, you weren't the leader. That item's now been sent to the chest by Tom Nook for no apparent reason. Right, well we'll have to waste time heading back over there in a minute. But first I want to do some stuff at my house. I'll need to be leader for that and you'll need to sit and wait for a few minutes doing nothing. You know what, just forget it actually... This isn't fun.""

The worst part is that this is clearly all in place as a ploy to get you to buy a second Switch and two copies of the game. The whole thing stinks of greed and I've lost a ton of respect for Nintendo as a result of this.

If you're playing on your own and you're into these kind of games then there's probably a good time to be had. If your main reason for buying the game is to play locally with a friend or partner then don't waste your money."
michauko,"Mar 29, 2020",5,"UPDATE BELOW.
Ok. The game seems fine. But if you are a family, several kids, multiple accounts on ONE switch. JUST DONT BUY IT. Every player but the main player is stuck after 30 minutes. You can't get the ability to create the basic axe. Why ?

1st of all, you can only create one island on one switch. Ok, why not ,the most active one should be the mayor. It's so sad but let day they have a reason for this (actually this is just a stupid restriction)
Then you realize you can't create a basic tool because the menu to do it (a dialog with Tom nook) just doesn't exist for non-main players..... Whaaaat ?
Ok, you think ""ok the main player has to unlock this so others can use it."" . Ahah. NO! You CANT.

Either it's a bug (so basic ?) Either it's a ""feature"", a deliberate choice. Then the game is unusable and the marketing strategy is "" like this game ? Buy each kid a switch, each kid a game and shut up"". Errrrrrr
Amazing.
Don't buy it. Or prepare for a fight at home.

Oh ,I almost forgot. The local multiplayer mode: useless, the 2nd player is just a pet following the other, farming for him, more slowly (stupid animation each time you pick up a piece of wood...). No split screen, no interest at all.

I'll wait a bit to see if a patch comes out soon. Or then I'll throw this piece of nook away.
'hope it helps

UPDATE : it seems after 2 or 3 specific actions from the main player, a new key character comes in and all players can finally get all the tools and trigger key improvements even if they're not the main player. Still, one common island or many should be a choice one switch player profile should be able to make"

alranican,"Mar 29, 2020",4,"I love this game so much. Been a long time fan of the series, but unfortunately my brother made the island so I'm not allowed to enjoy over half the game's content, and even more until he progresses. Even with this restriction, I can still find enjoyment in it, but it's so hard to justify the decisions to not allow secondary players to progress the island or make their own.
The co-op is a perfect way to visualize how terrible this system is. The first player, the leader, is the only person allowed to interact with anything in the game. The secondary players don't even have access to their inventory. The fact that multiplayer is such an obvious afterthought on a home console Animal Crossing is ridiculous.

I'd go as far to say it's one of my favorite games on the Switch since i""m so nostalgic for this series and just how much content there is. But, since I've been playing this with my whole family. We all realized we can't do anything until my Mom signs in to do whatever she needs to do. This just includes talking to Tom Nook to progress the game. Something that I CAN'T DO. And, the local multiplayer is wildly disappointing as well, It's even more limiting than no co-op lol. If they just added splitscreen that'd do wonders for the co-op experience. This is ridiculous Nintendo, I was happy with the game until it was all soiled just by some basic mechanics in it. This game would be saved if they just gave it a quick patch where you can give representative permissions, or change the island representative. I really want to enjoy this game since I've been waiting so long for it. I really hope this gets changed quick and resolved so me and my family can enjoy the game properly. Nintendo, please fix this so everyone with one switch and multiple people can actually enjoy this game for what it is."
markio,"Mar 28, 2020",5,"This is a great game - for the first person on a switch playing it. For everyone else, like my little niece who has the second account on her brothers’ switch, it’s an exercise in second class citizenship.

The fact that a little girl can’t have the same experience in a game as her bigger brother makes me pretty disappointed in this game. What kind of message is this sending?"

and you can play the game together as Family if your playing Co-Op... so if you can't play Co-Op TOGETHER then it's not even ""playing together as family"" then go buy your own Switch please...

Helpfulreview,"Mar 28, 2020",6,"This is a good game to play Single Player.  Quality gameplay, unique characters, not overly complicated.  Just an enjoyable game.  For anyone who has played the original Animal Crossing on the gamecube you will probably be the most upset.  Because you probably played with family members at the time, and enjoyed the minor multiplayer setup it had back then. This version has somehow managed to ruin even that minimal multiplayer functionality from back **** trade off I suppose is that they enabled an okay form of online play.  But when it comes to Animal Crossing the most enjoyable way to play was with others locally who could setup shop in the same town.They would be able to progress the town if you weren't there, interact with the town folk, the folk then mention them in dialogue the next time you play.  And you really felt like you were living in the same town/area.  You'd be excited to see the what changes they made next or upset that they beat you to it.  But hey, that's life.  Well now that 2nd, 3rd, 4th player cant progress the story, or help new residents move in.  Some DIY creations are kept from them.  And it downright **** to be that person.  Multiplayer is a huge part of this game which is why I'm giving it a 6 star.  Last quick bit on their online play: it is okay.  At least each person will get their own screen there. But it's not optimized and obviously hasn't gone through any QA testing.

Animal Crossing is one of my favorite games so this is why I'm taking the time to write this review.  Ultimately my personal thought is they royally messed up this game by not putting really any more than an ounce of thought into the multiplayer aspect.  But again the series is great, the concept is great.  Ultimately they added some interesting content to the game now.  I'm excited to see what they add in future updates!  Edit:  P.S. Sadly the local multiplayer issues are enough to where I had to tell my brother to return the game.  As he was hoping he'd be able to play it with his wife.  And once I told him about the issues he was in complete agreeance.  It's just not worth buying the game for that.  Worth pointing that out, because this isnt just some little mistake. They do need to fix it."
southoz,"Mar 28, 2020",3,Not being the primary player I am not able to do anything but fish and catch bugs.

Blocking progression based on the first person who played the game is terrible game design and the game has been a disappointing waste of time playing.
VivaLaPanda,"Mar 28, 2020",4,"A theoretically great game, held back by Nintendo's frankly astounding inability to design multiplayer functionality given its. 2020. Setting aside how completely useless shared-console multiplayer is, the online multiplayer feels more like it's teasing you about how good the game *could* have been if Nintendo had competent network engineers. To join someone's island, you must be friends on Switch, a process which for some reason still uses friend codes instead of usernames like literally any other platform on the internet. Then, you must click through around 30 seconds of dialogue to visit a player. You have to go through this pointless dialogue *every time*. But wait! To visit someone they have to ""open their gates"", which means going to an ingame location, and clicking through another 30 seconds of pointless dialogue. If you sleep, the gates will close and you have to do it all over again. Because of this, visiting another player effectively *always* requires communication through a 3rd party platform to coordinate your visit (no direct messages via your Switch account, sorry.)
Once you manage to exchange texts, ensure the other person has opened their gate, and go to join them, you are met with an almost minute long unskippable cutscene. This plays *EVERY TIME* you visit a friend. It locks you, and all players on the island you're joining. Once you get there, the island's owner will discover that they are now unable to place/move any of their furniture. Why? Because Nintendo has spent a solid 2 decades pretending that the internet doesn't exist, and so has no engineers on staff that can make online functionality.

The single player experience is great, but it's not worth $60. It's a fun game, but just go play **** Valley, it has more polish and plays much smoother than this half assed game. It's totally unjustifiable to have a game with multiplayer this bad in 2020."

People were complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per console, but honestly I don’t care. Me sharing the island with my sister actually made us become closer. I also haven’t used any online features yet because I don’t have any friends with the game.

Single player is where the game truest shines. With adorable characters and gameplay that makes chores fun. I can’t not recommend this people who enjoy just sitting back and relaxing. This game isn’t meant for people who like constant action as your meant to sit back, relax and enjoy the little things"

JackJack1107,"Mar 28, 2020",9,"This is a wonderful game. Not only does it allow the player more freedom than ever, the ability to customize your island to the full extent is so enjoyable and keeps you playing for hours each day. While time skipping is an option, it simply takes the fun out of it and it is more enjoyable to experience the game day by day and see your hard work come to fruition in the passing time. My only complaint is the lack of cloud saves, and contrary to popular belief, the lack of multiple islands doesn’t bother me, because the mechanic that hinders player twos progress was in New Leaf too, so it is simply a lack of further development and not a step back."
McKat,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons- Don’t buy it

My husband got me this game bcs he was trying to introduce me to the world of video gaming. I have to say- if all games are like this, count me out. Way to go Nintendo on destroying an otherwise great game!

How did they ruin it?

1- If you’re a multiplayer household, you can only create 1 island total & whoever has the misfortune of starting the game 2nd becomes a 2nd rate citizen on the 1st player’s island. That means they can’t do any quests, can’t make any decisions, don’t get the same kinds of rewards or as many... And you’re limited in the progress you can make on the island to what the 1st player does  So short-sighted!

Heck, 1/2 the time the “hot item” you’re supposed to sell is something the 2nd player doesn’t even have the recipe for. To fix this? You have to buy a whole other Switch game console. Not just a second copy of the game, which would be ridiculous enough in 2020. A whole 2nd console.

So painfully and obviously GREEDY!!!

Don’t buy it! 2- They purposefully didn’t warn anybody abt any of this anywhere on the game description, instead lauding it as the ultimate social experience. Fun for families, friends, couples... Bullcrap!!

Bcs when you’re playing with someone else, the 2nd player can’t collect anything. It all goes into the collection box. And if the 1st player looks at their storage kit or takes their tool ring out, it knocks out whatever action the 2nd player is trying to do.

3- Talk to them in the only way that will actually speak to them. Clearly the only way that actually matters to them.

Until Nintendo decides that they actually give a crap about their consumers (I’m not even asking that they care more about their consumers than their bottom line bcs at this point it’s clear that’s not going to happen), do not support them by giving them the money they’re clearly after with this disgusting decision they’ve made.

However, I am giving it 1 star bcs other than how limited the game feels, it is an enjoyable game and an enjoyable world. Even so, I probably won’t be playing it for too much longer if Nintendo doesn’t fix this. I just can’t see myself enjoying these kinds of limitations for very long. And I’ll continue telling people to not buy it- even when they’re not asking me."
Enchurito,"Mar 28, 2020",2,"It's insane to expect us to buy two switches just to actually play multiplayer, especially when you could fully play it all the way back on the GameCube.

The follower is just that and as such doesn't get to do much of anything fun. I also quickly realized that just being the second player to arrive on the island means you don't get to make any decisions. The primary player gets all of the good recipes and gets to advance the plot. Others do not. I had to even have her make me my own crafting station, as I did not get the recipe. The game is still fun for me, but it is a huge let down in what I'm able to do. It makes me feel like an npc that gets to idle around as the player does things."

bungsten,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"The decent but short story and many of the game's new features are locked behind Nintendo's absurd one safe file per switch rule. If you want to play this game with your family, friends, or anybody who plays on the same console as you, do NOT buy this game. If you are not the first person to play the game on a console, you become a glorified NPC that can't do anything to progress the story. Nintendo is being aggressively greedy at the expense of their players, it is absolutely ridiculous that Nintendo, a company with some of the most skilled, talented, and smart people in the video game industry made such a horrible design decision for no reason other than corporate greed.

Though if you plan to play this game alone, it is a very good animal crossing game reminiscent of the original gamecube game with many new features and an amazing story centered around building a deserted island with nothing but a few tents into a thriving, developed community. My only complaint about the story is that I think it should be (and can be) longer. The postgame, like all animal crossing games, has tons to offer as I expected, but there are a few omissions from the other games that make the postgame feel like it's missing something. There is no coffee shop, no fortune teller, no theater no barbershop, and only two shops. While the new island customization options and some other smaller features do provide some new postgame content, I don't think they add quite enough to make up for the omissions and I can't see myself playing this game for years like I did in city folk and new leaf.

Even with the decent gameplay and story, I can't justify giving this game any points at all because of its glaring design flaw in the one save per switch rule."

Desperately hoping for a patch to this issue but I would bet 100 bucks nothing will happen because why would they fix a problem that means consumers have to buy more products?"
jumbo1205,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"The multiplayer design decisions are completely insane. How do you put such little thought into the fact that the Switch is a home console with multiple users. This would be such a nice game to enjoy with family / significant others, but the gameplay is utterly broken for local multiplayer.

Allow multiple islands per switch. Allow secondary players to make progress on their own. Figure out a way to re-balance island resources for multiple players. This is absolutely infuriating.

Nintendo literally brands the Switch as a family home console. All of their ads show multiple users on one console. HOW DO YOU MISS THIS!"
Gnue,"Mar 28, 2020",5,"The game is mostly fun, although it runs into the standard animal crossing hurdle of having to wait days for everything. This would all be forgivable and even acceptable if you were able to have more than one island per game. With more than one active user the game grinds to an annoying halt. With the constant need to switch between accounts to share quest details. Yes, for some reason a second user has no ability to see details of the latest mission set by Tom Nook. More than that, some quests follow an all or nothing approach. So if you collect 15 iron and your wife, sibling or roommate has 15, you can't share in the glory. One of you has to drop them to the other to proceed. It's a silly limiting system and unexpected from a game that has allowed for multiple towns in the past."
WesWack,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"I was going to buy this game until I realized it is only one island per console, literally the most greedy atrocious thing I’ve seen since the stuff EA has pulled in the past few years, I will not be purchasing this thing until they fix multiplayer and fix this piece of crap 1 island per switch rule."
Syddie,"Mar 28, 2020",3,"I looked forward for almost a year to this game and I’m honestly disappointed. There are a couple reasons beside the awful switch-share deal:
1) the museum. I can’t get information about the animals/bugs/Dino’s, unless I talk to blathers with one in my hand. It ruins it because I want to know about dinosaurs and how am I supposed to just get another fossil from the exact one?
2) the music. I lived the music up until the new center was built up from a tent to the **** music is loud and I not calm, like I want it to be while I play, and there’s no way to turn it off of even down. 3) villagers requests/missions. They barely give me any, if at all. I miss them
Overall, this game let me down. I feel like I wasted my money buying it. Please, if anything fix the music."
Bandwidthbandit,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"The most soothing, relaxing game ever turns to garbage as soon as you try to cooperatively play with friends and family"
Warwolt,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"There's absolutely no excuse to not allowing for more than one island per console! It's a lovely game, but Nintendo's monkey paw strikes again."
SFJohnnyG,"Mar 28, 2020",5,"Don't believe the hype and don't drink the Kool-aid. While this game is graphicallly beautiful and the Animal Crossing style of gameplay has been taken to new (and better) levels. Nintendo made decisions around multi-player and family sharing that make this game broken.
For me personally, the multiplayer shortcomings aren't too significant. I like walking around with my son and discovering new things and showing off our accomplishments. I am not a big online person so I have not tried that part of the game, but I do understand people's frustration at not being able to combine online and local multi-player to enhance the experience.
I am more bothered by the way families (or Switch co-owners) are required to experience this game. The concept of needing a unique game and unique Switch to have separate islands is a blatant cash grab by Nintendo. This would not be an issue were the single island shared equally. There is, however, as system where the first person to create a character in the game becomes the ""island representative"", which means they are responsible for decisions such as where new houses will be built. The location of  buildings is not a huge problem as you can spend five minutes sitting together and agreeing on these things. What is a big deal is that secondary players are EXTREMELY limited in how they can contribute to these endeavors. Basically, you can send or give materials to the primary player, but this means that when a secondary player is enjoying the game, progress is halted unless they take out two controllers. My son wants to enjoy the game in a way that is characteristic of secondary player play style, but he is the primary player. This has led to a few arguments already as I ask him to focus on an island progression task but he just wants to collect bugs. This would be tolerable if you could switch the primary player or there was some alert that this might happen, but there is absolutely no in-game indication of the significance of being the primary player.
Bottom line, we are four days in and have made lots of progress, but we are thinking of starting over to save our family relationship. This game could have been amazing and allowed me to relax and have fun with my kid, but Nintendo broke it.
Also, no online backup. Seriously, Nintendo, I am losing my faith in you as a company."
Parag0N,"Mar 28, 2020",10,Don’t listen to the whining pu-c’s who didn’t read up on the multiplayer before buying the game. It’s not Nintendo’s fault they are dumb. The core experience of this game is fun as can be. If you don’t cheat it this game can last years and there is no “end” to it. If you never played any animal crossing games this is the best one to start with. Very easy to learn and tons to do if you enjoy it.
Dexile,"Mar 28, 2020",0,My brother played the game first so now the game is essentially unplayable for me.
LeeBa,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"The game had such hype behind it only to be quite possibly the most disappointing  of the franchise it feels so unfinished its unreal Only 2 shops

No island to meet new people and friends Tools break what is extremely  irritating Slowest paced game we have ever had House prices are absolute insanity the last room costing 2.5 million!
Also cant expand rooms for literally no reason

Amiibo are way to much **** taking 5 days each total to have them move in and walk around and even then the spot can get taken meaning you could be putting in the work for nothing

Diving is completely missing on the animal crossing game based on a island Furniture  has been completely cut what shouldn't really be a thing keeping in mind how delayed this game was from new leaf and even had its date pushed back"
oreganoCure,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"As someone who joined into the series well after new leaf initially released, I can say that this game has far exceeded my expectations. The amount of people giving it zeroes is frankly ridiculous. Sure, it has some flaws- local multiplayer is limited, and one island per switch isn't ideal. Still, as someone who's been sharing the game with three younger siblings since day one, it hasn't actually been an issue for me. It's what we did in New Leaf, and it's working well here too. If this kind of game is one you enjoy- something slow paced and peaceful- you wouldn't find a better experience anywhere else."
Gonefishin81,"Mar 28, 2020",9,"I love this game, I've had a blast playing since I got it on release. Every minute is enjoyable, from running around collecting fruit to helping your neighbors when they're sick. The game looks excellent, having cute characters while the water effects, shadows, etc. look incredible.  The only thing that keeps it away from being a 10/10 is the fact that froggy chair isn't in the game, but other than that, it's fantastic."
Renmir,"Mar 28, 2020",4,"Pros:
-Great early/mid game
-It's exciting to keep catch new creatures
-Gardening is fun early game
-Conversations with animals are fun early/mid game
-Crafting system is amazing
-Multi-player is fun early game

Cons:
-Conversations are repetitious after a while
-Getting a villager to leave is almost impossible without cheating. Please add a feature of some sort where you can choose an option in ""Red Text"" three days in a row to get a villager to leave. People are going to time travel anyways.
-Playing multiplayer with friends should not take so long each time to have someone come into your island. It's disrupting. The individual player should see the traveling screen, and then just pop a notification when it's been loaded into their friend's island.
-You can only play one profile per Switch. Same console multiplayer isn't fun. Split-screen or individual menus would have been better, as well as not having only one person who can make decisions. It's a family console - Resident Representative should be a shared title, so they can all move things the way they want, or even have their own islands and use Call Resident to play them on the same island but keep menu functions.
-No way to rotate camera for pictures, except to angle up. You can do it inside, why not outside?
-Shopping gets boring after a while. Could the furniture selection change maybe twice daily? 7am and 7pm would be good I think. Or make a multiplayer selling option, bring back Reese and Cyrus to sell things to other players for you for a price you set (no more than a certain percentage over their regular price)
-More visitors to campsite, more frequently. Let them teach players new patterns specific to that character. If each character had more specialty items it would be great.
-Pocket camp lets you invite people to hang out, so why can't you here? Maybe be able to ask a villager to come hang out, they leave after 3 hours and are unavailable for x number of hours/days. This way people could rotate and see the characters more, and get unique things for them"

Raggedy,"Mar 28, 2020",9,This game has been great so far. I think the multiplayer and all the island hopping is super fun. I’ve spent so many hours already looking for rare fish and bugs. Honestly once you start playing you can’t really stop. I can’t wait to see my museum all filled.

seraphilic,"Mar 28, 2020",0,**** greedy game design ruined my opinion of Nintendo and Animal Crossing. Needs more than one island per switch or AT LEAST an option to move characters and change primary. They patched a hack but left in game ruining bugs. A very fun game overall but not reccommended for families.

(oh yeah and the game is looking amazing and I still didn't have frame rate issues)"
Bobasaur,"Mar 28, 2020",2,Completely unacceptable to restrict the multiplayer to one island per switch and only allow the main resident to progress the game. How can Nintendo market itself as the “family” gaming console and make a decision that is such a slap in the face to families? Do you know frustrating it is for parents with multiple kids? I could MAYBE excuse the money grab if you had to purchase additional islands as an add on but this is just a disgusting attempt to sell more switch lites. So angry and disappointed.
fieldwork,"Mar 28, 2020",4,"I had so much fun for the first few days, until I realised that I can never progress this island solely because of the chance of who went first in my household.  My partner isn't interested in this game and won't progress the story. So unless I restart and erase all my progress, or play two games at once, I'm doomed to a lifetime of fishing and bug catching.  Extremely.disappointing."
hurricanelaurk,"Mar 28, 2020",2,"I absolutely love Animal Crossing and have played every single game prior to this one. I was super excited to play this one. .... Except now I'm Player 2, and can't do anything in the game. My wife was excited and made her character first, but she's a casual player and I tend to play every day. She doesn't want to restart the island and we're in no position to buy another Switch and another copy of the game, so why limit us like this? I play Animal Crossing for the relaxing experience and am now left feeling frustrated beyond belief. I honestly feel like I'm just an NPC in her game. If Covid-19 hadn't have put us all on lockdown, I'd be returning this game. Please fix this, Nintendo!"
rivoz,"Mar 28, 2020",5,I bought this to play with my daughter. Unfortunately Nintendo messed up with playing 2 on 1 console. I can't go through the main story like the first player. I'm restricted to wait for that and basically need to buy another switch and another copy of the game. That's useless. Otherwise the game is good though...
MisterMajestic,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"I haven’t played an Animal Crossing game in the past, but with the self-quarantine going on I figured buying this game to enjoy with my siblings would be a great way to pass the time. We planned on playing on our own worlds and had heard that there was a way to visit each other’s local islands. However, we were met with a restriction on our fun that drastically contrasts a game in this style. There is only  ONE island per CONSOLE. Yes, that’s right, you can only make ONE island on each Nintendo Switch. It doesn’t matter if you switch accounts. The higher ups over at Nintendo have decided that with this $60 purchase you are granted ONE little island. But that’s not even the best part! You see, you can in fact join islands locally! Huzzah! But... you can’t progress, you can’t check your inventory, you can’t even walk too far away from the person who made the island. Thanks Nintendo! And so, that leaves my siblings and I in the queue for a refund, and a feeling of disappointment. Surely that can’t be what the developers had wanted right? Well, that’s what they created. This limitation can be interpreted in one of two ways: At worst, a greed-fueled effort led by Nintendo corporate executives to get consumers to buy more than one Switch, so that you can have more than one island, or at best, a way to bring players together locally so that they can learn what a leader and a follower is, and where player 2 fits into that equation. Goodbye Animal Crossing, my siblings and I wish we had the chance to enjoy your content, but you had other plans."
cp531994,"Mar 28, 2020",4,"The game at its heart is fun, while also looking the best this series has ever been. Unfortunately this game doesn't offer anything new. Multiplayer is a sad excuse, if you visit an island of a friend and want to help build forget it. This game limits you interactions. Then there is 1 island per console. Saves are tied to that console. So if you damage or lose your switch your progress is gone. These factors way into this rating for a game that has the potential to be an 8/10."
sdallahii,"Mar 28, 2020",3,"Unplayable if you happen to be sharing the Switch with a family member who just wanted to try it out and got bored after first day, whereas I played the game for DAYS before realizing that this situation is making it impossible to progress in the game."
Kwek,"Mar 28, 2020",9,"As somebody who actually plays the game with 2 players on one console instead of just complaining about it. I actually like this feature, it gives us a lot more interaction with each other. After reading some of the reviews I've seen a lot of misinformation about the 1 island rule. My point is don't trust these 1 or 0 ratings who haven't even given the game a chance or even touched the game."

ZeldaWars,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"I really have been enjoying the game so far, but the reason for such a low score is one simple reason. The baffling decision to make it so there’s only 1 island per Switch console, because of this incompetence, my girlfriend can’t make any progress in the game and now has to wait to see if Nintendo will decide to fix this (which shouldn’t have been an issue in the first place)"
Draconequis,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"My sister and I share a single switch. We bought it together because we live together and we have enjoyed our games so far. Enjoying separate save files for all of the games so far on one system. We shared breath of the wild (which has a much larger map and more detailed graphics).  And now when we went to play we learn there is only one island per console.  Which means if you want to play animal crossing your own way you have to buy an entire switch. This problem cant even be fixed with switching  sd cards because the game saves directly to the switch. Does this mean that if I did buy a new switch I wouldnt be able to transfer my game save file over as well? I was planning to get a v2 eventually for the extended battery life.

Now I was willing to maybe overlook that, however this game was clearly built for one player. The first player who boots up the system gets to be the island representative. This means that all of the tool advancements, craftable recipes, and any building locations are all decided by player one. This basically makes player two a glorified npc. Not only this but I learned that you cant send fish or bugs to a friend. Which is so dumb because I purposefully chose the opposite region so I could give my friends cool things they dont have yet.

I had also hoped to have a great white shark in my room but the display for a shark is now a tiny pool with high walls and you can scarcely see the creature inside. I dont know why they decided to change the model to something that looks so awful.

I am severely disappointed in nintendo for what they've done.

Dont get me wrong the game is fun, but dont expect to play it with anyone."
Subayee,"Mar 28, 2020",9,Don’t understand why this game is being blasted for only one island per console it’s been this was through every single AC game ever. This game is a giant step up from the previous titles because of the gameplay and the graphics
robrcf,"Mar 28, 2020",0,Minus 9 points for 1 island per switch. You have to share all resources on your island with everyone in your house who plays which causes a lot of unnecessary stress. There is no excuse to have this restriction.
cheekynandoseu,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"Sorely disappointed with the choice to make it one island only per console. Not only this, but to give essentially all of the power to the first user? It's a completely greed-ridden business tactic if you ask me. What I cannot justify is that this decision was made for a game released on a home console, one promoted and marketed to be played and shared with your family and friends. I've never played an animal crossing game in my life, I was so looking forward to it seeing as I had purchased the special edition console for my partner, and I was met with nothing but dissappointment, as all I can essentially do is place decorations and steal resources. As a first time Nintendo buyer, this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth already."
KixWasHere,"Mar 28, 2020",8,"I like alot of the new additions to the game such as ladders, pole vault, etc. But the way they treat (Player 2) is horrible and not haveing a cloud save save file is a major step in the wrong direction. Not to mention haveing to pay a subscription to play online. But its still a good game, i just hope they can fix it later on"
AHDrcool,"Mar 28, 2020",2,"I’ll update this score if they allow multiple people on the same console to have equal responsibilities. I am giving it a low score because of the same issues that other reviewers  have mentioned (lack of multiple islands per console, lack of co-op controls, restrictions of “player 2” abilities.) these are unnecessary gameplay issues that could be fixed. Despite the potential of this game, I want to see change. Nintendo please listen to the users this time, I would love to have a better at home experience with this game with my partner."
HaliPuppeh,"Mar 28, 2020",4,"While the game is good from what I've seen and looks like fun, only being allowed one island per console is a deal breaker for me. All players should be able to have the same experience, but this isn't possible because only the first player has any creative control over the island.

AC is finally on a console that allows multiple user profiles, but those don't make a darn bit of difference with this game. Nice cash grab, Nintendo. We won't buy another Animal Crossing game."
Kanoshem,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Most reviews here that are low, are review bombs due to the fact that the game locks the Switch to one island per system. As well as the current lack of cloud saving. These are unjust and angry reviews that do not understand what the game is meant to be! Animal Crossing New Horizons is the latest entry in the Animal Crossing series, it is incredible, hosting many improvements, including a new random Island system whereby you can travel to a randomly generated island to gather resources, fish, and catch bugs. Not only this but nook Miles is a new system which allows constant progression for doing anything in the game (paying mortgage, fishing, talking to villagers, etc.). The restriction of one island per system is intended to make the game feel personal. As your island and all its progressive, is only on one system. It's truly the best animal crossing game to date and a must buy."
Sir_Wolfgang,"Mar 28, 2020",2,"Nice game, but what should this be with only one island an account! My wife and I, we love the former games, playing together in different villages, but now? But this is really disappointing. I hope, the will change it it asop."
MOleszek,"Mar 28, 2020",0,This game is cute and family friendly at the first glance. However if you have more than one person who wants to play this game it immedately goes from cute little farming game to frustrating hellscape.
STOPcryingdude,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"This game is fantastic. Relaxing, a lot to do and achieve, it doesn't get boring that easily!

Now what's dumb is how people cry about the fact that there's only one island per console. The game is more open than the other entries into the series. Cmon, get over yourself and deal with it for now. It isn't even a valid reason for you to rate it with 0 just because of this."
King1021,"Mar 28, 2020",0,Having only one player pretty much be in control of the island **** and is more of a single person game which was really disheartening. Stuff like this can turn fans away from playing the game again
Ah-choo,"Mar 28, 2020",0,Bought my wife the game for my switch. She’s 30 hours in. I wanted to start my own island from scratch but Nintendo expects me to spend $399 CAD more for a new switch and $80 CAD more for a game both of which I already own. This is beyond stupid and greedy from Nintendo. I’m extremely disappointed. Rated a zero cause I don’t get to play a game I already paid for on a console I already paid for.
Marayna,"Mar 28, 2020",0,the whole one island per switch console is a bunch of bs. don’t waste your money just play the ds versión at this point. would be a 10/10 game if it didn’t cause family issues with us not being able to have our own island. disappointed!
MomGamer,"Mar 28, 2020",0,It is hugely disappointing that the game only allows a single island.  My kids have been counting the days for this game to arrive (267 days of counting and waiting!!!!). One child played for a bit and the other got ready to play and then discovered they could not create their own island.  While the game play itself is fun and well designed this is a major weakness. With no warning at the outset of play that only a single island will be available.  Nintendo really needs to remedy this.
generalPattern,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"I'm sure my girlfriend would give a better review as her experience of the game has been unhindered by having the first turn at our new purchase of Animal Crossing. However, neither of us realised that we'd have to share an island, and as the initial player, her character gets the full experience of the game. However, I get to miss out on building up the island, contributing to key parts of the campaign and missing out on key information including items/recipes that prevent me from accessing whole areas of the game. She currently has to mail me a frigging ladder at the end of her turn. We have different schedules and frankly this ****. Don't bother with this version of the game if you will be sharing it with someone who does not have their own Switch. Nintendo, please explain this dumbass move."
JustinASec,"Mar 28, 2020",4,"The game is amazing, but the fact that I have to get another switch so my girlfriend can play her own island is insane and is kinda EA levels of greedy.

Zanderzen,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"Only one principal account.
I have two daughters, it is very cruel that only one can enjoy the game because of the bad practices of nintendo."
CrackPipe,"Mar 28, 2020",4,"So far, I have put more time into this game than I’d like to admit. I really like a lot of the new things that have been added, but I feel that so much of the old content that made the game feel well rounded is missing. I am at the point where I believe I have obtained every shop/ building in the game and there’s about the same amount as the GameCube game. Pros:
Fantastic graphics
Online works very well
Museum is beautiful
Fishing/bug catching is still solid
Fossils are the same Interior design system
Sending letters/presents to real life friends
Villager interactions are better
Lost items aren’t as annoying
Crafting system for building items
Nook miles system

Cons:
Only one upgrade of nook’s cranny
Very little to do other than fish, catch bugs, and collect resources A lot of beloved characters from older titles are completely gone. Only characters, other than villagers, are the nooks, Isabelle, blawthers, able sisters, and occasional merchants
No club
No garden store
No dream lounge
No kicks(he stops by town with small inventory)
No tours No post office
No shampoodle
No coffee shop
Items are very expensive for basic household things(ex:cello=100,000 bells)
One island per switch(doesn’t affect me)
Wait times for tutorial are many
Items break all the time
Crafting takes way too long depending on the item
Tedious work for resources
No tropical fruit
No hedges No swimming/diving
No ordinances
Moving buildings on island costs a lot of money and is not the easiest to get perfect Overall, I feel as if this game is just a hollow shell. For $60 I expected there to be more content then ever but it just feels barren. This is from someone who owns and has loved all the past games. Hopefully updates add a bunch of content, but $60 for an unfinished game is not acceptable."
SFODFOTOC,"Mar 28, 2020",1,If you have a Switch for only yourself then I recommend this game but if you have a Switch multiple people use? DON'T! This is really bad and quite frankly really throws me off. You can only have one island on the entire console. So good luck trying to experience all the game has to offer because others will take experiences from you and probably even accidentally steal from you. This is really bad and Nintendo needs to fix it now!!!!
Under_Ach1ever,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"I bought this game digitally for my wife and I. Started the game under my account. Wife wanted to play but cannot play her own game. She has limited abilities to play within my game space. This game doesn't let more than one person have an island on a Nintendo Switch. Not even if you have multiple accounts, with multiple Nintendo Online subs. Do not support this."
tacogardevoir,"Mar 28, 2020",8,"Sure it suffers from the inability to make more than one island along with the older animal crossing tripe, but the amount of review bombs for this game is stupidly overblown. It is an incredibly enjoyable game that just has some flaws for groups of people who all want to play. Just realize that the limits of accessing others islands for the most part is just the same as a Minecraft world or Terraria game. If the owner leave you can't play on that world again. Deal with it and enjoy the great game you do already have."
Joquerol,"Mar 28, 2020",0,Nintendo fix this.This is the worst time to be SO greedy. My wife and I were very excited to play our first Animal Crossing ever. Now we're probably just going to skip this one entirely.
Camelapollo3439,"Mar 28, 2020",3,"Well sadly I got to be the second islander, at first I was excited I got to live with my brother on the same island, but the problems started to appear soon there after... Basically there were no resources around, the other villagers are pointless, I can't even donate for building like come on man I want to help out. Nontheless it is a beautiful game, but I just can't play it basically, I can only fish and catch bugs to sell and that's it, I'm stuck in that same loop and honestly it can get boring."

Ari2711,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"My first Animal Crossing game and I'm absolutely in love with it. It's the perfect game to play in the current situation. There are tons of furniture, decorative and clothing options that all look beautiful. You can create your own designs and share them with everyone. You can even use old designs from New Leaf. The best part is the museum. Tons of fish and insects are available to be collected and donated to the museum. It's incredibly fun to meet up with friends and tour each others collections. You can even dig up fossils and donate them to be able to see huge skeletons of dinosaurs."
exycited,"Mar 28, 2020",3,"I bought this game, bc I thought it would be relaxing and fun. It probably is for the first player but not for the second player on the island.

My roommate started her playthrough first and I was excited to start mine too only to be extremely disappointed that I cannot make my own island and instead I have to be stuck on her island as a second player.
The fact that the second player cannot progress through the story like the first one makes it a sad experience - as a second player I am missing the story, some dialogue options and interactions as well as creative control over the island and so the reception of the game changes a lot for me. Also, it's not only the story, the mechanics change too - I cannot even get the axe recipe without spending the money. The first player gets it through interactions with Tom Nook. And while the cost might be similar in both cases, the experience is very different - i really dislike it.

The restriction of one island per switch is artificial and could easily be changed to one island per profile. I've already paid whole 60$ for this game - and because of the limit of one island per console it feels like the price is too high. Especially when we compare it to other Nintendo games at a similar price point like BOTW which can be played separately on different profiles.

Animal Crossing has a family-friendly rating and so you would think it would be a family-friendly game, but if you want to play with your spouse or have more than one child you would have to buy a whole new Switch for both people to enjoy the game on their own instead of having to share an island because of some artificial restrictions.
Also the fact that this cannot be remedied by buying a second game cartridge and only by buying a second Switch makes it feel like a cash grab on the side of Nintendo. I understand that the saves are stored on the console not the cartridge, but I am sure this could have been remedied in some way.

I had very high expectations of this game and was looking forward to spending time on my island paradise with cute animal friends, but instead I feel like an NPC in my own game and I have to fight over resources with my friend...
I wish I could give this game a higher score, bc it really is cute and sweet, but I don't feel like I can do that in this situation - thus the low score.

I hope Nintendo rethinks this and patches the game, but I am not very hopeful that it will happen."

bulletchan,"Mar 28, 2020",9,Nintendo never hid the fact it was one island per Switch. Please cry more. The true fans are too busy enjoying themselves to give a damn.
mediamajors,"Mar 28, 2020",0,"Is it just me or is anyone else getting tired of Nintendo's game restrictions??
I bought this game for my girlfriend with every intention of creating and sharing a island together but she arrived at the island first and now I feel like my island experience has been watered down. I'm unable to have my own save file and I'm unable to progress the game in any meaningful way. I'm basically a worker bee. Thanks for creating a wonderful innocent game and then drowning it with monetary restrictions Nintendo. I suppose you expect me to go buy another switch... Oh wait you can't find them because Nintendo doesn't understand what is expected of them"
irzaliando,"Mar 28, 2020",8,"Although the 1 Switch 1 save file is terribly frustrating, this game is still really amazing. It's simply the best Animal Crossing game to date."
Sammyjwt,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"This game is AMAZING! The review bombing on this website is truly toxic. Yes it's not optimal to play with multiple players on one switch, but this was already mentioned before release. It's not a reason to give it a 0/10. I have been playing daily since March 18th and I can say that this is one of the most fun and relaxing games I've played in a long time. There is so much to do, but all in your own pace. Want to play 20 mins a day? Go ahead! Or binge it the entire evening farming materials and crafting furniture for your cozy little house? It's up to you! Normally I'm into action games and shooters but so far I'm really enjoying this game and I can't wait to see what April has in store for us. 10/10"
Mishawak,"Mar 28, 2020",4,"Have been in the animal crossing fandom since the gamecube release. Me and my boyfriend bought a switch two years ago for the sole purpose of having a console to play on should they release a new animal crossing. When it was finally announced we were thrilled, mostly thrilled for multiplayer as we had always had to play at separate times in the past. This is not a multiplayer game. Only the leader gets access to normal features of the game, and you have to frequently switch out to get anything accomplished. You can’t fish at the same time because not enough fish spawn when there are two players, so you must take turns and decide who will catch what. Not only that, but I later learned that because my boyfriend was the first player to create an account, he would be the only one to get complete access to all gameplay. This means for any exciting developments, I had to wait for him to get on and get them done for me. As someone who plays more often, this is not too great for me. I love the game and the new features they have included, but it seems like they designed this game so you would absolutely have to purchase a second console and second copy just to get the full experience you were intended. I’m very sad as me and my boyfriend essentially have to fight over who will be the leader and it creates the opposite of a smooth playing experience. Really hoping that Nintendo decides to add some changes in the future. Even a split screen play would be better than what they have decided to implement. Great game, if you’re the only one in your household playing."
Gamer_Rich,"Mar 28, 2020",2,"Game is nice as a whole, really like the upgraded museum. With that being said however there was no reason why friend island could not have transferred over from new leaf to new horizons except for lazy ness."
Tibstradamus,"Mar 28, 2020",0,I have never left a game review but I made an account just to leave one for this game. Only having one island per switch is dumb but I can deal with it. Not being able to progress as the secondary player is ridiculous. Greedy Nintendo at it again. I'm sure there's people stupid enough to buy a second switch AND game just to be able to fully play with another person.
HarrisonBaggins,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"My review is based on the fact that I just happened to create my account after a 1st player. A 1st player's review may be totally different. As a 2nd player, you are required to sort of be a 2nd class citizen of the island. It's almost like you are living the life of one of the NPC villagers. You're unable to fully experience the whole ""start an island from the ground up"" thing the game was touting. Nope. Only 1st player can do that. You are hindered until they decided (and only they decide) how the game advances in any meaningful way. This is ridiculous game design."
thierfeu,"Mar 28, 2020",1,"The game is nice, smooth, fun, everything I love into a video game.  so my mark is 10/10

but... there is a terrible point that is the fact that only one island can be created per CONSOLE !
unacceptable, and regarding this decision the game desserves a -9 points markdown.

so it's 1/10"
Cpal4554,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Amazing game. So much fun stuff to do. Very well made, both for tv and handheld use. Easily worth the money. Considering how much fun is to be had, it makes sense they put in some restrictions. Not worth complaining about, you’ll still get hundreds of hours out of it, each!"
Arct1c76,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Graphics look amazing from the jump from New Leaf to new horizons. The one island per switch does kinda ****, but that's not really a huge concern for me  because I have fun sharing an island with my family, also if it can be fixed with an update then I dont think it should be counted against, that's just my opinion."
CallMeFreak,"Mar 28, 2020",2,"I felt the need to give my husband his half of the money back when we realized that he would be a glorified visitor. I started the game first because he drove and I started playing it on the way home after getting it.
Even if we wanted to get another Switch and another copy of the game, we can't. (Plus that's another $360 down the drain, or $260 if we want drifting issues we can't get fixed out the box.) By the time we can we'll both have moved on to something else.
I enjoy the game a lot more than he does, that's for sure. I'm glad that there's BL3 DLC that he can enjoy instead.

I'm sorry I want to spend my $60 the way I want to."
rihards,"Mar 28, 2020",0,1 save! rly? I hate this nintendou game. animal crossing is forcing me to buy additional switch to play with my FAMILY!!!!!!!!
Yawgmoth81,"Mar 28, 2020",9,"I very rarely give a game a 10/10, because there's almost always room for improvement. So that 's why I gave a 9/10. I was waiting for this game since the switch came out, after hearing and reading about the game while it was in development I made the descission to buy it, even with all the criticism out there... I was not dissapointed. It's a shame that there's only one island per switch, but it's another reason to buy a switch for my children so we can visit eachothers islands. It's not a reason to give this game a very bad review, because if the only thing that turns your 0 into a 9 or 10 is the one island per system thing maybe you shouldn't have bought it, because that was a feature everyone knew from the beginning... Do your research before you buy people... Otherwise just enjoy the game as is. I know I am. ;-)"
ThatSnailIsFast,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Y'all are being ridiculous. This game is phenomenal and it doesn't deserve to be review bombed because you can only have one island per system. I get it, kids won't enjoy the feature, but review bombing ignores how otherwise extraordinary this game is."

Ray1999,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"I've played Nintendo since the NES console days and I can honestly say that this is one of the best games released to date. Do not believe the haters, I'm sure they are all addicted to the game like everyone else and playing it every day but they think its amusing to bring a games score down like the Warcraft fiasco (which deserved a negative rating). Nintendo have always been 10+ years behind everyone else when it comes to online functionality so I did not expect multiplayer to work seamlessly and the fact I cant save to the cloud is annoying because i cant transfer my save files to my switch lite. Other than that just play the game, get lost in it and try to switch off from the coronovirus fears"
Thh90,"Mar 28, 2020",3,"I hate the fact that only 1 island per console as I believe most of the players would rather have the freedom to develop their island and have their own collections of stuffs by their own. If it is because of local co-op function, l would rather not have it, even though I have multiple family members sharing the console"

You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable."

Bmunoz23,"Mar 27, 2020",0,Only one island per console. The only way to get another is to buy another console I don’t mind buying another copy of the game but another console is too much. I’m leaving such a negative score in the hopes nintendo has a change of heart.

budweiserbuck,"Mar 27, 2020",4,"I love this game, but like all the other reviews I don't like the ""1 island per switch"", my brother was super excited for this game and it's terrible to see him upset, that just broke my connection with the game. I get some people are going to say, ""Why don't you just share?"" Well, I'm now learning that the first visitor, Me, has all the power, from naming the island, to even getting DIY recipes. Nintendo please fix this! I don't want to see my brother upset and have to get a new switch! Switches are kinda pricey for our family, plus getting a new copy would just break the bank."

Artsyskid,"Mar 27, 2020",10,I loved this game and it was very fun. The only problem was the 1 island per switch restrictions and I would give and 8 but some are giving this game a zero just for one flaw alone.
RoyDonk,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"This game epitomizes Nintendo’s anti consumerism. The ways this game goes about save files and local multiplayer is archaic and ridiculous. Nintendo purposely limits any additional player in ways that force people into purchasing multiple switches if they would like to enjoy the game with another person. As an additional player you are limited to being basically useless. Nintendo has also limited the player to a single Island save file per switch, with no cloud saves or file transfer. If you own two switches, Too bad. If you share a console and want to have separate islands. Too bad. If you want to enjoy the game with a family member, partner, or friend on a single console. Too bad. There is not a single technical limitation to create the major flaws of this game. The issue is Nintendo’s greed and desire to take advantage of their blindly loyal fanbase. Nintendo is the EA of the first party and should be treated as such. Don’t let Nintendo spit in your face. Don’t buy New Horizons."
SuperKrampus,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"Best game that I have EVER played! So much thought and care went into turning this into a genuinely immersive experience. Personally, the 1 island per switch problem didn’t affect me as I have my own personal switch and my brother who also plays has HIS own. The characters are  way more lifelike than in Animal Crossing New Leaf and I feel like my island is truly mine. You can place furniture inside OR outside as well as building shops, bridges, ramps and even a giant robot! With the shops you can find carefully designed furniture and clothing! Most of the furniture you buy can even be customized into multiple styles, truly making it feel like yours! You can also craft your own furniture such as chairs, tables and beds! It makes it feel like you have a part in your island life. With the clothing  store you can buy hats, shirts, pants and more! Unfortunately this game has been review BOMBED by people who in the end won’t make change! This is the best Switch game and I highly recommend. This game is a 10/10, not 5.7."
Lunalata,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"If you have your own personal switch that you play without the need to share, this game could easily be a 10 for you. However, as someone who shares a switch with their family, this game is extremely disappointing and limiting considering the fact that only one person can play the game to its full potential. I am appalled at the idea of forcing all owners of the switch onto one island where only one player has full control over progression while others fight over the limited daily resources. How unbelievably stupid was that decision? I know many will argue that this is how Animal Crossing games have always been. So? That doesn't make the decision good. For instance, Breath of the Wild was an instant hit in my household. This could not be the case if everyone was locked into the same save. Instead, everyone had their own save and could make their own decisions. Scratch that with Animal Crossing. My younger sister was eager the play after me, but couldn't find anything to do after 5 minutes. For a second player, this game deserves a 0/10. This stands true until every individual profile has the option to tend to their own individual island. It just ruins the experience. I hope these negative user reviews open Nintendo's eyes to this frustrating issue. Especially since the Nintendo Switch is advertised as a console to be shared..."
Slimestelax,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"to be honest, this is really a good game for a single person since I don't have anyone in my family to play it is really a nice experience"
Arials22,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Had lots of fun with it for first 2 days. But it's a super slow game after that. Got to the point where i enter game, pay off loan and quit for the day. Don't know if its gonna pick up after but i don't fell like it."
CatPCgames,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"I absolutely loved New Leaf, and being able to experience an animal crossing game again, this time in HD is amazing to me. The game looks, sounds, and plays amazing. The addition of crafting recipes gives something for Collectors to, you know, collect. Many novelty items are great for Recliners to kick back and relax. Stylists now have the ability to choose exactly where their villagers move in and can change their location later, as well as being able to terraform.
However, the fact that you can only have one island per system and the absence of many fan favorite items, bring my score down from a 10/10 to a 9/10."
EpicCookie112,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is an amazing game and the perfect addition to my Switch library. Don't let the people review bombing this game, the game is amazing."
Acecount,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"I had to create an account just to rate this game and hopefully leave a review people would read. This is easily the best entry in the animal crossing series! Incredibly customizable and just breathtaking. The negative reviews touch on pretty much only one singular thing; the lack of multiple islands on a single console. I understand this. It **** that you cannot have more than one island on a console, however, leaving a zero review because of this factor is not genuine. A ton of people dislike one factor and rate it a zero. It isn’t fair. I urge anyone reading this to look up footage of the game rather than reading these very weird reviews. It’s a fantastic game, just know going into it that there is only one Island per console, which was explained in a Nintendo Direct prior to the release of the game, and covered by many gaming news companies."
Lamp2109,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Apart from what the other users have to say about this game being frustrating as a second player, Animal Crossing: New Horizons evokes a very real anxiety during this time of isolation. With only one island and limited resources, this game is more reflective of quarantine than island life. In a time when you have no control, playing New Horizons as the second player is amplified by the limited choices and control of “your” island."

MinedGames,"Mar 27, 2020",8,"I am giving this game a 8/10, although the game would be a 9/10 for me personally. As you all already know by now the one island per console limitation is VERY stupid. In order to progress in the game you need to person who owns the island to do it, making the other people playing very limited. The game itself is amazing, but the one island per console limitation makes this game not near as great as if you are playing solo. Personally i would rate it this way if you are playing solo: 9/10, and if you are playing with multiple people the experience is not near as great, and i would personally say the game is a 6/10 while playing with multiple people. This could have been pretty easily avoided if Nintendo just allowed people to have more than one island per console. Overall the game is a must buy if you plan on playing solo, but if you are playing with multiple people the game is not near as great."
Tyryx,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"The game is completely ruined for the second player. With the inability for multiple islands you would think Nintendo would have made all players on the island equal. No. Only the original character can actually participate in the majority of the game. Only they can build things and upgrade shops and progress the game. All other characters are treated as second class citizens. This is completely ridiculous. As someone who shares a switch, and has been waiting for this game for seven years, I am unable to play it because I can’t access what was advertised due to these arbitrary limitations that are outdated and unnecessary."
SilliestPutty,"Mar 27, 2020",0,I wouldn't have purchased this game if I had known there was only 1 Island per console.
Cbabybear,"Mar 27, 2020",9,First time back to animal crossing since wild world! Although I can think of a few things that could increase the quality of life I think it’s amazing and over the last 7 days since launch I have spent most of each day on my island.
ItsChestnut,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"Besides the fact that this game is really good, there's something I need to talk about. Don't trust any reviews for this game. It's honestly pathetic how this review bombing is turning out. If you take a look at hundreds of 0 reviews you'll find their logic extremely flawed. And most of all, I noticed a common pattern between these reviewers. It always starts out with ""My wife/kid/friend wanted to play the game too, but you can only have one island per switch! I thought this game was good until I realized this! KEYWORD: GOOD. Look, I'm sure there's plenty of legitimate reasons why someone would want to rate this game a 0/10 but this is just petty. Most of these people were enjoying the game OR think the game is good, and yet they give the game a whopping ZERO because their wife can't play! Nintendo CLEARLY stated the game would only have one island per switch, and these people are acting so surprised that their wives/friends/kids can't have a different island.  One feature (and not a big one at that, multiplayer isn't essential to the game) shouldn't affect the entire score of the game. These people would at least give it a 2 or a 3 if they were taking this seriously. I'm not trying to act like a fanboy here but this is just getting out of hand. If you don't believe me just look at all of these reviews. This is why nobody respects the gaming community. I'm giving this game a 10/10 because I'm trying to combat all of these unfair reviews. I respect honest reviews, even if they were giving the game a 0/10."
BartLink,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"El mejor Animal Crossing q se ha hecho a la larga,si Nintendo le mete más actualizaciones sería un juego de 10"
BFM,"Mar 27, 2020",6,"Playing this game for one week now (without time-cheating), I still have fun, and appreciate the new tasks and changes that I see every day.

But I am unsure how long this will last.
I' already very disinterested in what the characters have to say.
The job of collecting resources (fish, wood, fruit, bugs) in order to grow the town or get new stuff feels more and more like a joyless grind.

Especially crafting / buying objects is senseless.
You can't use ANYTHING except a few simple music instruments.
Bicycles, lawn mowers, Scooters, toys .... nothing is interactive, everything is just to look at.

The only thing in this game that you can do besides gathering resources and  placing furniture is ...
sitting down on things.

I wish I could tell you how the multiplayer is, but I have no idea.
Nintendo doesn't let me play this game online.
I have a huge list of friends that own and play this game.
But there is no way to connect with them.

It seems like I would need to know how to contact those people IN REAL LIFE and then give
them a special generated code to invite them to my island.
Just let me invite people from my friend list PLEASE.

Graphics, animation, sound design and atmosphere are all fine.
But tasks like growing plants, fishing or mining minerals feel very shallow and unrewarding in comparison to **** Valley.
Animal Crossing could learn a lot from that game."
AlDente8,"Mar 27, 2020",0,I just want to share an island equally with my significant other. What's the point in playing now?
AzilTheRatonga,"Mar 27, 2020",5,"So, I'm not going to review bomb the game like everyone else is. I actually do like this game and see it as a pretty okay game, not the best, not the worst. It's got wonderful fun and interesting villagers, and the game's great for when you just want to sit back and relax while the whole world burns from all the crazy **** going on but... here are my main issues with the game:

-Island limitation, being restricted to one island per console is kind of a **** move in my opinion especially when I cannot do anything other than upgrade my house because I let my boyfriend make his character/island first. the Nintendo Switch is expensive as all hell, no one's going to buy a second Switch just because of that unless they're rich.

-Controls. The controls are just.. awful, and apparently it's always been like this according to my boyfriend. I feel like with this being a new game, you guys could have fixed the controls so it's not a pain in the ass to whack a rock with a shovel, dig things up, capture bugs or chop down trees. You have no excuse to keep the controls the same as previous titles.

-Story progression limitation, as mentioned with Island limitation, you, as the secondary player, cannot do **** meaning only the first character can do the story while you just sit there doing nothing other than upgrading your own **** you end up having to wait until the the first player does things to do stuff. It really ruins the experience for everyone involved."
lazer59882,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"this game is incredibly boring and repetitive. Apparently the entire first day is just fishing and catching bugs. There is no reason to come back for a second day because the first day will **** so hard. Positive reviews are of this game or from people who hate video games and/or suffer from crippling anxiety and need the escape from their every day life. For anyone who actually likes video games, and enjoys their life, stay away. This will bore you to tears while you were waiting for the next horrific, repetitive, menial task for it to give you"
Hoenn,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"I will only fix my score once Nintendo:

Allows us to move the Resident Services building, get rid of the campsite, craft in bulk, and have additional islands on the same console.

Otherwise I'd give the game an 8."
ThisGameTrash,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"trash game made by greedy company, what else is there to say. will never get because of one island per console"
SunDonut,"Mar 27, 2020",0,you can only have one island per switch witch ruins everything if you have a family. Nintendo is a greedy pile of crap for doing this. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
sameerhameedy,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"This game is ALMOST perfect. If you love games that relax you then this is the game for you. If you have multiple people using your switch however, look at other games. The inability to create multiple islands on one switch makes it so that there has to be a  ""primary user"" is the first person who plays. Which doesn't sound like an issue but the game does not accommodate for the person who plays as player 2+. If player one gathers all the resources of the day there is nothing left for player two to collect and hence nothing for them to do. Player one can upgrade their house, upgrade and create all the shops, and customize the landscape and transform the deserted island into a city, what can player 2 do? Nothing except upgrade your house. An obvious attempt from nintendo to get people to buy more switches. In the past you could switch out you save card, you cannot mess with your saves in this game. You cant even send your data to the cloud to switch off saves because nintendo doesn't allow cloud saves. Which also means if u lose/break your switch the hundreds of hours you put into the game will be lost and you have to start all over. If nintendo wants to make everyone live on the same island then there HAS to be equal accommodation for EVERYONE on the island, but there isn't."
Chuckchuck,"Mar 27, 2020",9,Me and my wife have not spent so much time playing games together well next to each other as we both work on our own islands occasionally flying to each other's islands to deliver unique items or bells to help each other advance faster while getting to design our own islands. We plan on having profiles on each switch but just haven't gotten around to it as there is just so much to do!! Definitely need your own switch to play. This is the best animal crossing game to date or it would be it it had say a couple of n64 games running on a in game emulator.
uxzehjwiwxtruei,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Two players sharing a Switch is a nightmare. Only one island per switch is allowed, and on top of that, the second person to create their character has basically no autonomy in the game's quests and storyline.

Some folks can't afford a Switch for everyone in the house. If the console has multiplayer capabilities, so should the game. Nintendo knows how to do this, it's plain ol greed thats stopping them."
idontcareaboutu,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Remove the one island per console restriction! It completely ruins the experience for separate profiles on a shared Switch. This is a home console that gets shared, not JUST a handheld.

POS game"
fillecerise,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Appalling money-grab from Nintendo in that only one island can be made PER SWITCH. This means if you want to fully experience the game, you must buy another switch console. This is ridiculous and I have never played a game that does not allow for more than one save file on the same console. Nintendo must fix this, as it is transparent that this design choice was greed-driven."
jay-bee,"Mar 27, 2020",0,I hope that Nintendo eventually adds multi-island support. The game is fun until you start to run into roadblocks that ruin the fun for you if you're not the first person to start the game. The fact that you can't play the game in full unless you are the primary player is insane.
Timingplanet,"Mar 27, 2020",10,Great game. People need to quit being children and review bombing it. Its completely ridiculous to review bomb something over a 1 island per profile limit it doesnt mean they wont add more....
Isaure,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Animal Crossing is a nice game if you're the only one using the switch...Like many others here I can't enjoy the game to the fullest since I'm sharing the Island and I wasn't the first to start the story. I already have problems and I just started: can't give donations, can't get an axe, can't help with the progress of the Island, etc. It just feels like I have no purpose at all other then helping the first user :( Really hope Nintendo will be able to change this issue"
Weekndxo,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"It's a real shame that nintendo locked 1 island per switch, this is unacceptable and really disappointing. They cant even think of the fact that tons of people out there like having their own worlds their own way. Horrible companies."
haihatu,"Mar 27, 2020",4,"The game is outstanding, nice calming gameplay and a very relaxing story BUT I just cannot progress because I'm not the main player, I have a younger sister and she's the main player and can progress the story. I just can't in general. I would love to make it a 9 but this is just a huge deal breaker to me."

Kaliden,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"By far the most anticipated game for the year that I was waiting for. Could not wait to experiance it with my daughter. Good thing I let her start first. She is loving it. As for me, there is zero reason for me to play at all. Never mind I am the one that paid for it all. One island and one player for progression period is less antiquated as it is an obvious greed grab to try to sell another console for each household. That is not going to happen. I pumped up Nintendo like crazy to everyone I know this year and now I feel betrayed. I won't make that mistake anymore. Going back to Stadia and Xbox."
GeorgeC97,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"I bought this game for my partner and I as we were both fans of the game when we were younger and fancied some nostalgia to get us through lockdown. Being the gentleman that I am I let her go first, however, I didn’t realise this would have lasting consequences from what I can only see as the full game experience. As a player 2 profile (even though I bought the **** game) I cannot progress, at all. All of the island progress features, only the first profile who opens the game is able to make any sort of progress. For me, it has ruined the whole experience. Nintendo have literally **** so many people here and I am one of them. **** me did this game not go through any rigorous testing, I mean, any sane person would surely shoot this design down. Awful awful stuff. Updated needed ASPA to correct this cluster****. Nintendo deserve all these awful reviews for ruining the experience for many fans, including myself. I can understand why ratings from critics were high (lone experience) but for most of us working class folk, one switch per household is all we can afford. Plus £50 for the game itself, which I bought, and now am completely restricted to gaining the full experience.

****"
Becausejohn,"Mar 27, 2020",0,Extremely disappointing for a family household. My partner is the only person who can do any of the interesting factors of the game. This ruins the experience for anyone else.
Mchand9818,"Mar 27, 2020",2,One island per console pretty much ruins it. At the very least there should be an option to allow players on the same console to have equal power when it comes to decision making within the island.
Friendzie,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"All of the positive reviews are from people who had the game to themselves. For a family it's just not fun that only one person can have the full game experience. There's really no good reason for it. The original Gamecube version in 2001 only required you have additional memory cards, not multiple Gamecubes. Now in 2020 we need multiple Switch consoles to do the same thing? Massive step backwards. Also, this game is nearly identical to every other version in every meaningful way. The quality of life improvements they added would be the equivalent of a free patch for any other major release, but in Animal Crossing you pay full price for a new game. Listen, I love the Switch and I love Nintendo, but it's a miss for me. If you never played an Animal Crossing game, and you want a very chill relaxed game to play, and you are the only gamer in your house, maybe you could give it a shot.  Or if you are just hopelessly addicted to Animal Crossing I suppose you might still think this is great. For everyone else: avoid it."
TwntyrACFan,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"You can only make one town per console? Even though I purchased 3 seperate copies of the game?

Thank God I read the paragraph-long disclaimer on the back of the box before opening the shrink wrap."
delphi2,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"While this is a lovely game to play while in isolation, it is absolutely terrible if you have even just two people per household who want to play it. Not everyone can afford to have multiple switches per household. Nintendo dropped the ball in regards to multiplayer use on a single switch. My brother and I went 50/50 on buying this game and because he made his character first, I have been reduced to a secondary character that cannot assist in major island development, even though I spend more time playing than him. It’s quite frustrating. I would love to give this game a wonderful review but I simply cannot."
Birbie,"Mar 27, 2020",5,"I haven’t had animal crossing new horizons yet but from all the videos, gameplays, reviews and all I really love how it is. I really want to get it already haha, it’s worth it."
LordMantis,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"One island per console is a ridiculous and very disappointing design decision. In a household of four people, only one will have a full experience with Animal Crossing, unless the three remaining people buy their own Switch consoles just for this game alone.

Having not played an Animal Crossing before, learning about this during my wait for the courier essentially killed all my hype."
GavinBrialy,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"The game isn't playable if you have more than one family member who wants to play, so I guess choose your favorite family member? Only 1 island allowed, unless developers update that restriction."

Grumpelstilzkin,"Mar 27, 2020",0,My Daughters and I enjoyed playing the game until we discovered that there can be only one island saved per console and one person controlling it.  That's deal buster as 3 of us share one console and it's a ridiculous limitation.  If Nintendo patches this I'll change the scoring to 8.
Razz3020,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Love the game its so cute! HOWEVER. We are a family of 4 and were very disappointed to find out we can each have our own save file....only one person can have an ""island"" and advance the story. My two kids were very disappointed to find this out. Read online that you cant even buy multiple copies of the game to fix this ):"
xgeorgiiax,"Mar 27, 2020",2,"This game feels so incomplete, it doesn’t even match the content new leaf had several years ago?? Why :( There’s barely anything new? You’re just adding from new leaf at a slow process.

It becomes boring repeating the same routine every day and it drags.. I miss the mini games we could do in new leaf being on that island and collecting medals. I also miss doing favours for villagers. I’m quite disappointed as I’ve waited years for this game, it’s too slow.

The crafting system is just dull, smashing rocks and cutting trees over and over spoils the fun and becomes more like unwanted chores. You have to carry the gatherings in your pocket to craft them which takes up too much room and it doesn’t link with your storage which is silly.

There’s not enough content for adventure. Moving buildings is also expensive and a long process, also upgrading them takes a day. Where is the fun?"
LeoNeo,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Dear Nintendo, my kids and I was waiting the game more than a year, and what for? Separate islands and separate saves for each USER - this is so basic and obvious requirement, I just can't understand, why you did it this way???"
GoldFishy,"Mar 27, 2020",3,"Great game, its super chill and addictive good job nintendo. The multiplayer is where it gets complicated. Players can only own 1 island per switch. So the console isnt a family system anymore. It becomes a 400$ personal console. They made it so other accounts on one switch can play on the same island but that player cant do much apart from fsrming the resources which is ridiculous. This feature may as well not exist. I really hope nintendo can get the family focused view they once had. Because this really **** for every household that bought the game thinking they were going to be able to compare islands...

Cheap shot nintendo. Really"
johnpmorales,"Mar 27, 2020",0,I have requested a refund for my digital purchase of this title after discovering that the game is locked to one save file per console. Every other title we own for the Switch allows a save file for each account; there was nothing to indicate such a limitation would be in place. Ridiculous.
OliverRedd,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"Honestly made an account just so i can express my deep frustration of the ONE ISLAND per console debacle. Me and My wife were both extraordinarily excited build our own Islands, after she played for a couple days i decided it was time and was extremely let down when i realized i couldn't have my own Animal Crossing experience. Please for the Love of all that is gaming FIX THIS."
Giangi,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"Firstly, I would like to say that this game absolutely worth the wait. It is clear that the development team put in a lot of effort and care into each detail, interaction and activity, and is what makes this game so charming to look at and play. Secondly, whilst I understand that Nintendo are being a bit greedy with money, these review bombs are utter rubbish as they complain about something that has been a part of Animal Crossing from day one: the fact that one copy of the game comes with one town or island in this case. They even addressed this in the direct. People enjoy complaining to gain attention it seems. And lastly, this game may have its faults and short comings (as no game is perfect), but it has a good sense of longevity. It's a game you can play for years to come.

My score: 9.8/10"
StunnerPony,"Mar 27, 2020",4,"Well, my brother and I just found out that he can't create his own island on Animal Crossing or actually do much of anything since he's considered to be Player 2 and needs me to do everything before he can :T

This **** and just feels like Nintendo trying to force us to buy not only a second copy of the game, but also a SECOND Switch since there can only be one save file per Switch."
Coreyd,"Mar 27, 2020",0,Great if you're the only person playing on your system. Every additional player is a glorified NPC who misses out on the entire progression of the game. Can't even buy multiple game copies for one switch to mitigate the issue. Some serious BS crippling what is otherwise a phenomenal game.
craftmultiple,"Mar 27, 2020",5,"I don't really care about the one island per switch thing, it doesn't affect me. But the simple fact I cannot craft multiple items at once is enough for a five. Spending the better part of about two minutes to craft a decent amount of fishing bait because it is one at a time is insane. For the love of god Nintendo, please allow me to craft all my fishing bait at once."
copper1454,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"I was excited about this game until I found out the 1 island per console limitation. Really need to fix this. I watched my girlfriend play for hours and was excited to start my own island and adventure, then find out that I'm stuck on hers. Not fun for houses with multiple players, and should be an easy fix regarding save files setup."
ViiDough,"Mar 27, 2020",2,"I really enjoy animal crossing, this game is great, if you are the first player to play the game on the console, I see no reason why they would make it so that every user on the console has to share an island and that only the first user to play it can enjoy the full experience of the game. It ruins the game for me as I let my brother play the game first, I play the game more and I am unable to do everything he is able to do. this is what happened to me, I was going to pay half for animal crossing and my brother was supposed to pay for the other half, but we played the game for a while and found out that the second player is extremely limited to what they can do compared to whoever played the game on the console first- not just when you're playing together, but when you're playing alone, just because you weren't the first to play the game on the console- it's a huge letdown. I really like the game, but I can barely do anything, even when I'm playing alone just because I wasn't the first to play the game on the console, and It's like that on purpose, so I doubt they'll fix it. I'll have to buy a whole new console and copy of the game just to get the full experience, while my brother gets to play it normally.
I'd rather not even play it at all."
cosmiagrl81,"Mar 27, 2020",2,"Incredibly pissed - I just wasted my money and now Nintendo is gonna have to hear me **** about it. This game only enables ONE save file per switch. I bought this game for my brother, sister, and I and now only one of us can experience the full gameplay since the founder is the sole person to make decisions that impact the island. I have countless switch games that enable multiple save files and are the same price if not cheaper. This is incredibly overpriced and poorly designed. Although this game does deserve many of its raving reviews, if you share a switch with other people it is a waste of money. Looks like I just bought my sister a sixty dollar game. Great. I hope you repent for your sins Nintendo and stop shoving money up your buttocks."
Juloan,"Mar 27, 2020",4,"Great, except for the fact that you can only have one island per system, which almost completely ruins the experience for people who share a switch"
Rilee222,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"The one island policy is disrespectful from a company who is built upon making family content. This isn't a huge problem for me, I live with my gf. However the fact that only one of us can make progress is terrible and whoever we decide gets to do so will feel terrible. This is blatant greed from Nintendo's part. It's like they arent even trying to hide it. I was so excited now I'm just sad.I made an account just to post this, and I will come back and give it a better score if fixed."
MonkeyGamer18,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"it’s a great way to pass the time of being at the house all day! You get to make your own little Island and make new friends along the way. It has great music to listen to and many things to complete like the museum where you need to collect all the bugs, fossils, and fish you can to help complete it. Sure it might take a day for some items or villagers to arrive, but it is worth it at the end where you see your completed island."
Nookbook,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"Extremely disappointed in Nintendos decision to only allow 1 island per console. Its just a greedy money grabbing tactic that completely ruined the""family friendly"" aspect of the game. I was so looking forward to this release but now I am totally turned off. I don't usually leave reviews, but Nintendo needs to see that they can't keep exploiting their customers. I sincerely hope they release a patch for this because as of now, I'm no longer particularly interested in supporting their company until they do. Which is unlikely."
RanjoSmith,"Mar 27, 2020",0,The game is completely broken for me since there's only one island and I have to wait for the island rep to progress. Nintendo really screwed this one up.
calebgray,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Excellent game outside of the *enormous* issue that is the limitation to a single island per console. This is not only infuriating and completely unprecedented, but also an entirely unnecessary constraint. Furthermore, the progress on said island is hugely dependent on the individual that created it, and the others on the island are severely limited based on what the original creator has and hasn't yet done. Cannot give this game the good score it deserves in light of this issue - Nintendo needs to fix this immediately. On the bright side, EA finally has a competitor for greediest video game company of the year!"
Berryy01,"Mar 27, 2020",2,"I was wainting this game since last year  but now im really disappointed. I play with my brother and i cant experience the game as he does. Cause i cant do a s.. in the island. Its frustrating cause my brother take all the resources and do the fun things while the only thing i can do is fishing or catch bugs...

Besides  that I think this new animal crossing is incredibly better than the other animal so im sad :("
Ulisesg,"Mar 27, 2020",3,I don't understand why is it one island per console. Also implement better activities for Co op even if you have 2 consoles there's not that much to do.
KhalilaAnn,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Amazing game for player 1, every other player gets the absolute shaft. They miss out on a ton of content because you can only have 1 island per switch, and whoever logs on first gets to make all of the decisions. Player 2 through 8 are basically glorified NPCs. Yeah, you can build a house and sell things.. But that's about it.  You're locked out of advancing the story, you can't build things for new residents, you don't get all of the achievements, it goes on like this. Absolute garbage that you can't get around this by using different profiles. In other versions all you needed was a second memory card. Now if you don't want to pay for an engines system, you don't get to experience the full game."
GroovySugarCane,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Only one island per console??? My mum and I used to play Animal Crossing new leaf when I was a kid both having our seperate worlds where we could do what we want. But now my mum is delegated to a secondary role because I'm player 1. That so unfair! We both want to play our own worlds! Why is it so hard to make seperate islands for each account????? Nintendo did this purposefully. I hope their greedy cash-snatching arses are happy and content with their choice to do this. DO THEY NOT KNOW that most familes can't afford to buy another expensive switch????? Far out, they sit in their ivory towers not knowing what it's like to be a normal goddamn family trying to make ends meet. Such a simple design choice to make when making animal crossing NH, yet this simple decision causes so much goddamn suffering. Gonna go REFUND this stupid game, I don't want to be part of this PARASITIC CORPORATE BEHAVIOUR"
midialastarla,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"It's extremely unfortunate that play is restricted like this. If I could have my own island, separate from my sibling's, I'd be fine if it couldn't access the internet or whatever. I don't need to visit anyone else's island! I just want my own place to play, honestly. Such a bummer!"
Cavan29,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"Do Not Allow Young Children to Play First!  I made the mistake of buying this game for myself but allowing my 6 year old to start the game.  He started the island (with a misspelled non-punctuated name) and got everything going.  No major issues there!  I’m now player 2 but I’m held by the short and curlies by my sons progress.  He played a few hours the first day but that’s all his attention can take.  I’ve been playing for three days and I still don’t have a shovel because he hasn’t progressed yet.  This is a major issue.

Honestly, the game is cute and a lot of fun.  I just hate that I’m unable to do anything because all progress is locked to the first player.  I don’t mind sharing an island, I think that’s kind of fun that we can share decorating and supplies but I’m the bigger gamer and I would play this game more if I could do anything other than fish and catch bugs.  So, I can’t give it a good grade."
BatMansTights,"Mar 27, 2020",9,People are giving this a 0 out of 10 because of one missing feature and honestly I would have gave this a 10 out of 10 if local multiplayer was better. This is by far the best animal crossing game
DrNextgen,"Mar 27, 2020",0,One Island for one console. It’s a disgrace for a game and a company who want to provide a multisocial gaming experience.
MateuszM,"Mar 27, 2020",0,0 Points are way to Good. My girlfriend was so happy to play that Game. We don‘t want to buy a second Switch so it is impossible to play this Game for us:-S if they doesn‘t fix it we will sell this usless Game. Sorry Nintendo thats the worst decision you had made ever.
Awsomnerd,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"I love animal crossing games, and so II bought this for me and my girlfriend.

realitycheck27,"Mar 27, 2020",3,"Would not recommend for multiplayer! I want to love this game but as a second player I haven't been able to really participate and haven't even gotten all the basic DIY recipes the main player gets (like a bed and things later on, not the tools which I finally figured out you could buy). Probably an amazing game if you're only one player but not having your own island OR recipes just makes being a second player very unfulfilling."
ArmstrongH,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Wow, what an overrated POS game. I have played ALL the Animal Crossing games. People are treating this AC like it's something brand new and ""fresh"" when it's again, literally the same game they've been making since the N64 version and then the ported Gamecube version.
In fact, this game is WORSE than the previous iterations - there's no Gyroids, for example! - and you can't have a second player come on to your island and be treated the same exact way as you would. What were they thinking?

I just don't understand why everyone's treating this game like it's something amazing - where were you people when AC came out on Gamecube? Oh not even born yet? How about DS? How about 3DS? Wii? For all the cool things this game has (mostly small improvements to UI and custom designs), it's a HUGE step backward. I'm done with the AC franchise for good.

Stop making the same game and saying it's different, Nintendo!!!"
Salgas,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Not a Family Games, One Island for all, it's a shame for Nintendo.

pinkquake,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"I am extremely angry on how nintendo decided to deal with multiplayer. Honestly, I would probably rate this at least 4 stars... IF I COULD ACTUALLY PLAY. My sister bought the family's nintendo switch, so she always gets first pick on what to play and who gets to play. She also bought our copy of New horizons. I was very excited to play, as I had New Leaf but got it when i was young and wasn't really trying to progress. When she got back, she had played for about the rest of the day. I asked if I could play, and she told me that you can only have 1 ISLAND PER SWITCH. That is so dumb to me and I don't see any other point of Nintendo doing that other then to lure you into buying a new switch console. I still played with her though, and the leader thing is also so dumb. If you're not gonna let everyone have their own experience, at least let us all talk to people and actually be able to go around. I am definitely not buying a $300 console just to play animal crossing, so i really hope they change this. It's obvious that they are doug it for greed, and I would HAPPILY buy another $60 game to have my own island. But that wound work either. So good job Nintendo, I CANT be the only one who is enraged by this. I'm not going to buy into your greed and get another console. Hopefully this helps anyone looking to buy the game that was advertised as a ""family"" game,  and i hope you rethink and try not to give greedy nintendo money for this terrible idea :)"
Charlii,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"I have loved every minute of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The graphics of the game are beautiful, and the attention to detail is amazing. The possibilities for decorating your island are literally endless, and the pro design feature helps your character feel like... you. Decorating your home and your island makes it really feel like you’re building a community from the ground up, and that’s an amazing feeling to have when you’re playing a game like this. New Horizons’ gameplay is ****, and you can sink hours into the game without even realizing it. The islanders are all unique, and having all of these different personalities is part of what makes this game so immersive. Even the crafting feature, which I wasn’t so excited for before release, is such a great feature to the game. The museum looks beautiful, especially the fish exhibit. The Nook Miles system is also a great addition to the franchise as an exciting new way to get new islanders to come to your island. Overall, the single-player experience is a must-play for anyone who owns a switch. Now, on to the multiplayer. I have to say, some people who have been reviewing this game aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. You can’t be mad when you realize that there’s only one island per switch after it was advertised to you. The online multiplayer was amazing from my experience, as you can get your friends to come see your island, and you can go see theirs. This adds to the feeling of community you get from spending countless hours on this game. I’d easily give this game a 10/10."
Anamary,"Mar 27, 2020",3,Nos lo compremos mi pareja y yo y nos decepcionamos al ver que no podemos crear una isla cada uno ni que el segundo personaje pueda hacer misiones.
Riverblare,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"I can’t believe that I can’t have my own island. My roommate gets to do all these fun things, progress the island, access tons more diy recipes, make important decisions, and all I get to do is collect bugs and plant flowers. When I tried being collaborative with my roommate, all I could do was hand over materials I harvested like a slave so she could make cool things. I get so angry watching her play it. Games shouldn’t be made like this. I shouldn’t have to get my own console. This game is utterly crap. Worst decision ever."
Janderson3435,"Mar 27, 2020",2,Game itself great but I share the switch so feel like a **** npc because I’m not the island rep and therefore can’t change the island at all
Neyland,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"AN:NH is a great game with little quality of life issues for example not being able to craft multiple items and some items can not be stored, but these are just small issues that while annoying they don't ruin what is possibly one of the best games to come out in a long time. So dont let one save per console influence your whole review, yes its annoying but its dosen't mean the game is a zero"
Ohio_Gamer90,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"The greed of Nintendo , you can only make 1 island per console. This is absolutely ridiculous and no reason for it... well for Nintendo the reason is to sell more games and consoles. It would have been nice for everyone in the house to have their own separate island but we will not be buying more consoles and games. Get your s*** together Nintendo and stop being worse than EA.... that is quite a feat to attain. Congrats"
dstevens1008,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"Great game besides the fact the first player gets all the progression and basically all of the useful choices, while everyone else basically just gets told go buy another switch to get that experience even after buying a 60 dollar game , and if that's your defense piss off you clearly didn't pay for yours yourself. Like that makes evensense, oh the 60 dollar game screws anyone that didn't start up the game first ehh whatever quit crying spend another 260 on a new switch.... you sound dumb end of story."
UvaroviteKing,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"So I payed around 300 for a brand new Switch console, 37 bucks or something for an annual online family plan, 64 bucks for the game, 75 bucks or something for a second controller, and you're telling me my wife and I can't access the same progression and island control features. That's about the greediest thing I've seen in a while. That's ridiculous Nintendo. Thank you. It's a shame because this game is beautiful, relaxing, and cute. But the limitations to the second player are completely experience killing."
GantzJar,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Nintendo, this is greedy! The only reason to limit one island per console is to force your gamers to buy more switch console. Please listen to your gamers. I'm a long time fan of the series and is really disappointed to see this happening on switch console. The purpose of having different gaming account on your console is for your gamers to enjoy their gamers independently."
veox,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"The game is wonderfully simple and nuanced with plenty to do and discover. It gives players a reason to put down the game at times, but you keep coming back.

Unfortunately I got this game to play with my partner for 1 console co-op play. There really is no true way to play this way as was advertised. The second player is essentially an NPC. The UI and controls for single console multi-player are embarrassing for such a renowned title. I would give this game a 10 if they simply hadn't even included the feature at all; it's highly misleading. For it to work so well with online and multiple console multi-player, it seems like a regrettable attempt to force console purchasing. I would love input from the studio on why they failed to deliver a coherent single-console co-op. The UI and controls while in single console multi-player come across as if it was an afterthought  It is both hard to use and cumbersome. The inventory or tool selection isn't even available for player 2. Is it really that hard to apply the same feature to all players? Seems like poor code architecture to me. Not to mention the second player can't participate in the game contents in any meaningful way. Player 2 gets a very lazy stream of ""check with player 1"" messages instead of having NPCs treat player 2 as a player rather than a tag along NPC. Overall, for my circumstances, this game has failed in the most important ways which is why I cannot recommend it for users like me."
YungSambal,"Mar 27, 2020",3,"Me and my little sister were so excited to play the new animal crossing. It's our first animal crossing game, so we couldn't wait to play it. When the game arrived I let her play first, but when I started to play on my Switch account I realized that there were some things off. It appears that you can only have 1 island per Console. That's absolutely ridiculous. There is a reason to have multiple Switch accounts and merging the accounts into 1 game is just wrong. It forces us to buy a new Nintendo Switch so that we both can enjoy the FULL experience. She can play the game normally, but I cannot do certain things like: pick an island, naming the island, build bridges, make houses for visitors, can't have DIY recipies and a lot of other things. I basically can only contribute to my sister's island. It's so annoying and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. My excitement went from 100 to 0 real quick. I wasn't really following the news before the release, but apparently they mentioned it in a Three Houses demo live stream. I didn't watched the livestream so I didn't know. All the websites where they sell the game also didn't mention it and the website where I bought the game also said nothing about a 1 island per Console thing. Even the trailers didn't mention it. I'm just so mad about this, I've spend 60 euros and I can't even play the full game. I really want to love this game. It looks Hella fun, but as someone who started the game secondly: it feels more like a slave game. I really hope that they update this whole situation. Let the player choose if they want to share the island or build their own island."

This is what is like to be second player in this game. The save file restriction for each island per console is just too much.

redamper,"Mar 27, 2020",5,"It's a great game but it **** to be player 2. I bought the game and my girlfriend created her character first, so no I can't build a museum, can't build a store and so on. Also, if she had already collected most of the resources and watered all flowers, all I can do is go fishing, catching bugs or travel on another island. Everything is very cute on the island, but it leaves no content for me."

joewp,"Mar 27, 2020",3,"giving this such a low review does not feel right, but i personally feel that it is only fair.
i feel that nintendo hasn't put much thought into the fact that the switch is a console which has multiple profiles, also siblings tend not to want to share saves which will lead to arguments. to make all of this worse even though up to 8 players can play on one island only one of those 8 ( the first player to begin the game) can actually do anything of significance. It would seem little less harsh if the game was linked to a cartridge or digital copy even so then this seems very anti-consumer. I cant see what would be so bad about adding seperate user game saves"

jhm98,"Mar 27, 2020",10,Probably the best game of the year and the best switch title so far. The negative reviews are obviously jealous haters who can't accept that the Animal Crossing franchise keeps giving high quality games and get even more successful. I can grant that I will be playing this game for a long time!
elFlexor,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"It's undoubtedly the most stunningly beautiful game in the series, drawing you in from the first second you play and offering a perfect getaway during these trying times. Everything feels a bit more polished and improved from the last entry, even though there are can be slightly frustrating inconsistencies (such as the tool belt not storing your tools while the dressing wand does store the clothes) - but those are few and far between.
The atmosphere is simply soothing, causing you to linger and stay for longer than anticipated even if you just quickly want to get some chores done.

Unfortunately, the way online / multiplayer features are handled feels lacking and old-fashioned, but that's what we've come to expect from Nintendo by now - always 10 years behind the latest tech. Nevertheless, I personally feel that the island quickly becomes a very personal space that is best enjoyed alone, with only some irregular visits from others - so I don't put much weight on the online features.

Also addressing the critisisms being voiced in the review-bombs at the moment:
The one island per console limit has been known for a long time ahead of this release and people acting surprized and entitled just didn't do their research. Also goes to show how playing together on one island is really not the main aspect of the game, making the bad multiplayer features I mentioned even less significant.
Having to share one island per console is nothing new for the series, the 3DS had it too. It used to be more easily possible to bypass it as it technically possible to have one island per memory card / game cartridge."
joshyleon,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"One of the biggest oversights, imho, is that you cant go to Nook Miles islands together. Instead when I visit my wife's island I just mill about occasionally helping gather wood and water her plants, which just diminishes her ability to play her island. I dont even give gifts in person anymore since unlocking the postcards to friends feature so theres really no reason to visit.
Meanwhile if we could all visit an island together, we could at least have fun in a little gathering instance; running around trying to find the best / cool stuff and meeting new villagers together."
MattGough,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"The worst game for families due to the priority of one player. The player who names the island is the main player and the others are so limited in their gameplay. Trying to force people to buy another switch. Limitations of second player include:

- Not being able to complete a lot of the quests.

- Not being able to buy or craft tools unless the first player has unlocked them before hand.

- Not being able to move buildings.

- The First player getting all DIY recipes collected by the second player or themselves. Whereas the second player only gets the ones they have collected. - Limited creatures available to catch. In my experience the second player is a lot less likely to get wasps from trees etc. These are probably not all of the limitations for the second player but they are the ones that I have stumbled upon.

It is a great game for the first player but I wouldn’t buy if you are wanting to play with others. This just seems like an excuse to make people go out and buy another switch which I believe to be outrageous."
Nohri,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"A great game worth playing if you have the slightest interest that succeeds at everything it wants to do, but this isn't for everyone so you may not enjoy it if this type of game isn't for you. My only complaint is the limiting of one island per switch which is really bad as it causes conflicting creative ideas and competing for resources, so if you share a switch with others who want to play this game, then that's a big issue, and I can't fully judge how big of a deal this is"

klin,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"One island per console is a ""design decision"" that is, at best, in poor taste, and at worst, straight-up predatory behavior.

Ascathar,"Mar 27, 2020",6,"I made a metacritic account specifically for this review. This is not a review-bomb, this score actively reflects the amount of joyment I got out of this game keeping in mind the following things:

1: The 60 dollar price tag
2: The Islands limitations
3: The gameplay itself

The game itself looks beautiful, and the core gameplay loop is a lot of fun. This gameplay loop is relatively unaltered for a second player who has to reside on the same island as the first. However, any meaningful progress, and thus reasons to boot up the game at all, has been stripped away for a second (or more) player.
Being player 2(+) means you can not make progress towards the museum (and thus catching different bugs and fish is moot), it means you can not interact with villagers in the same way (and thus always have to resort to buying every item from the store, instead of being able to find the recipes through the story), and generally means you are living the life of an NPC on player 1s island.

Being player 1, on the other hand, provides a well-polished and extremely rich game, fully worthy of a score around 9/10. It's a unique life simulator, where everything you accomplishes gives you no small amount of joy.

In other words, this game is a gem, where one meaningful design flaw ruins the experience for hundreds of thousands of players (which I doubt is an exaggeration).

I am contributing my own review in the hopes of any sort of change coming to this current setup.

I am fully aware that having multiple islands per Switch is unrealistic, and would also detract from the premise of the game, but I do feel it should be possible for active players to have the same sense of wonder and explorations. Make npc's give player 2(+) the same items, allow player 2(+) to submit their captures to the museum, and allow them to contribute to the building of other items. I understand that the general lay-out of a town can be determined by one person, but that doesn't mean every fun element of the game has to be stripped away.

Thank you for coming to my Ted-Talk."
Sazero,"Mar 27, 2020",5,"I thing the game is pretty good if you're the only one playing it, but i was a second player, and as a second player i give this game a 5. My sister wanted the game and she was the first one to play it, and after i started playing too, as soon as i discovered that i couldn't create a new island for myself i knew this was going the same way as new leaf.

Except this time it's worse and buying another copy of the game isn't gonna solve the problem, you have instead to buy a new switch, and I'm not really willing to spend €200 for a Nintendo Switch Lite just for animal crossing. At this point, i'd be happy even if they added multiple islands as a €30 dlc, even if i know that would upset many people, because that's something i can actually afford.

I don't even really get why this is supposed to be a good marketing strategy, since most people are just gonna be like me and can't afford another console, the only people i could see buying multiple consoles are people like famous streamers or youtubers.

Having only one island per switch would have been fine if all the players could do the same thing, but only the first player can progress, and since my sister plays a lot less than me i just feel like i can't do anything and my experience is extremely limited, and due to this i just can't really fully enjoy the game, knowing all the time that your experience is this limited for me is just annoying,

This review is based on my experience as a second player and i get that you may have a different opinion if you were the first player. If i was the first player too i would probably have the same opinion as you.

So long story short, it's not a bad game, but if you're the second player your experience is severely limited and you can't fully enjoy the game.

I don't want to sound like just another review bomber who goes like ""game bad, Nintendo < EA"", I hope i do not sound like one. Hope this sounds more like actual criticism. This is the actual first review I wrote, because i felt like i needed to share how and why i'm not completely enjoying the game."

CaptainKos,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Shameless greed to force people into buying multiple switches for the full experience. I thought animal crossing was a game you were allowed to share without being punished for it. I can't play the game without deleting my partners island to progress. When the island rep is in quarantine unable to play, you're unable to progress, unless you want to delete their island, which would be an easy decision, if you were a monster."
mswrx,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"The game is good. I bought it for my and my daughters. The moment I found out that only one of my daughters who happened to arrive first in Atlantis can get the receipt for the flimsy axe and do many other things, that neither me or my other daughter could do, I couldn't believe it. Then I have to find out that this is a feature - not a bug. This is simply unacceptable. All others not arriving first are just sitting in the back seat and can work as slaves. At least the receipts then should be shared. What is point for the other to have their own house if they can't produce anything and are dependent on tools they also can't create?"
Happy_Specs,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"See, reviewing ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" is quite hard because you're essentially reviewing two games. The first game is ""Animal Crossing: Representative's New Horizons"", the other is ""Animal Crossing: Build a house"".

The thing is, is that if you're the representative then this game is great. You get to contribute to the island and do a lot of events, progress through the game, and just relax and have fun in general. It's a crying shame that Nintendo didn't see this extreme design flaw, because otherwise I would've given this game a 10.

Normally on the Nintendo switch, you can play one game on multiple profiles, letting families and such other groups have an equal amount of fun in a singleplayer game on a single switch. Now, Nintendo had the 'great' idea to make it so you can only have one island per console. Animal Crossing treats the switch as a huge save file. Now this would be fine, if all profiles/users of the switch could contribute to the island. Well no, only the representative has any control of the island, which means any other player can literally do nothing in the game at all. This is so extreme that I had to look at tutorials to see how I could get the recipe for the axe, which turned out to be that I had to pay for it. To get the vaulting pole? I had to go onto my sisters account and give bugs to Tom Nook just so I could progress. This issue is so extreme in fact, that most of the time you'll have to pay bells to get tools, either that or wait for the representative to do something specific. Now you can probably see why this would **** for a family or a friend or couple, but this gets worse. There is near nothing a second player can do in this game other than develop their house, that's it. This game turns from a relaxing game where you can have fun and develop your island, to a house maker simulator. This oversight really nukes the enjoyment of the game.

Overall, I hope Nintendo can fix this big issue and restore my enjoyment in the game, for now though this has killed any will in me to continue playing. For now, I have to give this game a 1 due to my personal experience."
Ignir,"Mar 27, 2020",4,"The individual mode is perfect, a traditional animal crossing with more options and things to do.

But the multiplayer, and the alternative accounts in the same console, are ridiculous, I don't know how this things doesn't impact on the final ""professional"" reviewers score.
I've been playing in the same console with my girlfriend, I've created the first character, and she doesn't have missions... she has to wait  for my next steps... and in the local multiplayer game, the second character can't do anything, is ridiculous.

stana149,"Mar 27, 2020",1,"I'm so torn on this game. For a single player, the game is fine. It's exactly what you would expect from an animal crossing game. If, however, you share a console or what to play multiplayer with a friend, you might as well give this game a hard pass. Nintendo has once again proven to be 20 years behind on modern online features, and has implemented what I can only describe as hardware based DRM. The first player to boot up the game will automatically become the ""primary"" player, meaning that the game cannot and will not allow any other player from progressing the game. Each individual user profile CANNOT make their own game to play and they will all share the island.  Yes, each switch can only have ONE island. It's not so bad if you are playing together but as two separate people playing at different times, anybody other than the first player is little more than a glorified visitor. When the first player progresses and unlocks furniture that can only be unlocked through progressing the game (save for complete rng gifts) the other players get the shaft and don't get the recipes. They have no way of acquiring many pieces of furniture. Other players can't have conversations with villagers, take progression requests from Tom Nook, or even deliver materials for a request that the primary player has already gotten. They cannot teraform, build bridges, pick out plots for houses, they can't even use emotes because a villager has to tell you about them before you can use them, but villagers won't talk to the other players.

With the amount of things the other players CAN'T do there might as well not even be multiplayer.

And this is all before mentioning the excruciatingly slow and tedious menus. You have to go through 3 prompts just to open your island up to friends. The menus function as if they were designed for a 3 year old to be sure they know what they are doing. Every. Single. Time. You catch a fish it has to zoom in, play an animation, and tell you that you caught a fish and say some dumb fish pun.

Oh and any time somebody comes to your island, for some reason the game has to take you to a 30 second loading screen. Incredibly tedious if you have more than one friend. Why can't I continue playing while they load in?

All in all the game Is held back tremendously by all the completely ridiculous and unnecessary restrictions, but that's good ol Nintendo for you. Any other company would be thrashed for the amount of ridiculous limitations Nintendo has put in animal crossing."
EddieOak,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"Looking at the GAME (leaving the 1 island per console thing out of it), it is possibly one of the best games to come out on switch and a must have. It has so much to do and lots of addicting activities that have you coming back for more. Just be sure to look at some tips, you”ll end up discover something new everyday!"
Lord_Nep,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"The game looked amazing when I first heard about it. I've always loved Animal Crossing games. But this one not so much. I hate it because the first one to start up the game becomes the ""Resident Representative"" and gets to choose the island, name it, build houses for the residents, do tasks which lead to the construction of a museum and the construction of a shop, and other various tasks. Everyone who starts the game after the ""Resident Representative"" is put into the same island and is unable to do any similar tasks. As someone who isn't the Resident Representative I have to say it makes it hard to stay interested. My brother who is the Representative, always gets tasks to do while the only interesting thing I can do is pay off a loan or maybe build furniture. I have to deal with whatever he chooses to do because I have no other choice. It doesn't give me as much freedom as I expected. The game is supposed to be about how you build your own island and not about favouring someone over others. It forces the others to live on an island which is controlled by someone else. Basically, the game ignores what it is supposed to be about.

I'm really disappointed in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The developers have made a great game but it has a major flaw which makes the game hard for me to enjoy. $80 spent just to be let down. Thanks Nintendo. You could've done better."

Even if, it is for keeping the SIMILAR tradition like the old games, this “one island per console” decision is still very inconsiderate under many situations."
Mefis,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"This game in itself is excellent. HOWEVER it has a big flaw that ruins everything, the way the game despises secondary players. Secondary players are practically in-game visitors, spectators who can hunt insects and fish, collect fossils and buy items, and nothing else. For the progress of the island, secondary players need the main player, the first player who played and created the island. Sharing the island is great, it is in keeping with the spirit of the saga, what is outrageous is that the game does not allow secondary players to do anything. The secondary players cannot, for example, create new constructions, such as bridges or the store, they cannot donate materials for the construction of these projects ... In addition they also do not have access to a significant amount of item recipes ... They cannot participate in the missions of the game ... That is NOT FUN. This game should be appropriate to share with your family or your partner, with your loved ones, but clearly Nintendo does not want that. Nintendo wants you to buy a new Switch to play the full version of the game ... Attention! Not a new copy of the game, but a damn new console! Nintendo your console is great, but it is a family console not individual. For the love of God patch it. Nintendo, you have ruined the gaming experience."
Butler1989,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"Hi,

The game itself is ok. However limiting to one island per console is crazy! My partner played before me now I basically can't do anything she has to do everything. To get DIY recipes the second player had to buy them but only after the first player has got them during game play.

Essentially Nintendo expect you to have a second switch for all users to fully enjoy this game which is nuts. You pay alot of money for these games you at least expect everyone to be able to use them properly on one console!

I really hope Nintendo address this in an update!"

Jad13,"Mar 26, 2020",5,This game is locked behind the first person who plays the game and so others who start have to wait for that person for progression throughout the island. This game would be so much better if Nintendo let all players contribute equally to the games progression.
adirose37,"Mar 26, 2020",2,"Please please please fix the two player system. I was having so much fun playing this with my partner while we're in quarantine, but today he unlocked the housing construction project and as the second player there is literally no way for me to access the 18 new DIY recipes. I am left out of everything in my own life, and now I'm left out of a stupid game too."
Dannya60,"Mar 26, 2020",0,Nintendo has ruined this game with their greed. If you share a console with anyone do not buy this game as only one player is allowed to enjoy the game PER CONSOLE. Even if you buy a second copy it will still only let you play one save per switch. Not only that but the second player only counts as a visitor and can’t contribute anything to the island besides gathering supplies. Ridiculous decision by Nintendo.
jakechs,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"My wife and I love the game but we only have one switch and therefore one island and totally different schedules. It would be OK if we could have multiple islands on different memory cards or buy the game multiple times to have multiple islands or something but because only one of us can be the resident representative it's made it incredibly frustrating.

The local co-op is really a bad experience, and it's so frustrating because we both love the game so much and this really makes it difficult when we can only have one island :(. Really really sad :("
anomalycomplex,"Mar 26, 2020",3,"I'm sure this is a great game for my daughter, who is the resident representative. She was the most excited, so we let her play first. I spent several hours trying to figure out what the point of the game was, only to discover that since I'm not the resident, there's not a point. Didn't realize in buying this game for our family that only one of us would have a real game experience. Very disappointed."

SeveralCircles,"Mar 26, 2020",9,"Amazing game that is just too close to perfection.

There are not a lot of negatives, so let's start with them.

First off, you already know where this is going. If you didn't start the island, if you want to contribute to the island, you are going to need to get used to cooperation with the island leader. That kind of ****. I don't have a problem with it as I play with my family, but I'd imagine siblings having issues with this. Do keep this in mind before buying if this is important.

The other issue I have with this game is the first week or so. It's sloooow. Even for an animal crossing game. It was kind of tempting to time travel at a few points. If you pick up the game, stick it out until the upgraded resident services building is built. It does pick up from there.

As far as negatives go, that's all I got. Now here are a few things I love about the game.

First of all, the game has a ton to do. From decorating your island to designing shirts, hats, and dresses, you'll never run out of things to do. That, along with unlockable features and buildings all along the way, you'll find yourself popping in every day, and getting **** into it and next thing you know it's dinner time.

Also, the online exists. Its like new leaf's online. Not great, but eh, it works.

All in all, I'd 100% reccomend picking up the game. Ignore the butthurt review bombers who read an article on Kokatu and suddenly hate the game over something that hardly applies to them. If Nintendo fixed the way the island sharing works to allow non-leader residents to contribute more, this game would break the review scale."
Purple_Avenger,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"Was looking forward to playing this but when i joined i was the second on the island and so missed out on the full intro and welcome onto the island as well as access to tools and other features. which makes the game unplayable and a completley soured experiance for anyone sharing a console.

From a single player perspective the game is charming and the gameplay is what you can expect if you have played an animal crossing game before (peaceful and fun) Though the first week you can feel like you are waiting around for the infrastructure  of the island to be built before you can let loose with your creativity. If you are a single player it is worth a buy if you like animal crossing games. As a second/Third/Fourth player I cant recomend this game to play if you were intending on sharing an island.

It feels like an odd choice to make it this way as the trailers and promotional material did not state from what i saw that the second players would miss out on so much of the features it was always mentioning what great multiplayer it would have. Just seems very un-nintendo. I can only hope that they change the way the game is saved so that each profile has their own save/island i would even maybe be a little less salty if it was cartridge locked so me and my partner could each have our own AC cartridge on the same switch but if we wanted our own islands now we would need to buy another switch making this seem like nintendo knew what they were doing hoping people would buy a second switch."
vinylcbm,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"This game is just addicting, it’s hard to put down when you start, it may be one town per console, but it’s been like that since the GameCube version, this game deserves way more credit, graphics are amazing, crafting is fun, etc"
Seina,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"I’ve never played Animal Crossing before, sooo my bad, I should have researched the game first (didn’t think I had to, ya know?). So yeah, I spent hours figuring out why I can’t do **** this led me to look online to find some tutorials or tips, but learned that the first person to play the game is the only one to make major decisions or progress the game (I was the second player, obviously). Seriously?! That’s utterly garbage. I’ve never been so disappointed in a game before that I’d make an account on metacritic just to post this review. Again, my bad, I should have looked into the game and read the reviews first before wasting my money.

It’s a cute game and the one island/primary player might work for some couples/families, but if you are completely new to Animal Crossing then know what you are getting into before buying."
Oatman,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"This game is awful, boring, and dull. You can only have one island per console. I want my money back."
Aesir420,"Mar 26, 2020",8,"By far, this is the most inventive version of animal crossing. As someone who's been playing since 2002, and by proxy grew up with this franchise, I love the amount of customization that you get with this iteration and it blows new leaf out of the water for this reason. There are problems, but most are not nearly as pronounced as some make them out to be. DIY being the main gimmick puts the control directly into your hands, so you get to build the island in the most literal way possible. Certain construction projects still require you to wait a day before getting to use it, but that's nothing a little time travel can't fix. Time travel, though I personally don't like it, circumvents most problems that come with how this franchise's progression works, and while some people just want to max out their town as soon as possible, animal crossing has only ever worked when there's something important to do. When you complete everything, what else is there? So, if not for this flaw that all animal crossing games suffer from, it'd be a 9/10. Only having one island per switch is annoying, yeah, but at the same time, is it really a reason to give a rating that should be reserved for games like Sonic the hedgehog (2006), or crappy movie based games like shark tales? At worst this game is a 5/10, at best it's an 8/10. Clearly, Nintendo should've made islands pertain to the profiles and not the system, but this game is such a perfect sequel to the previous games. New horizons was made for a certain kind of experience, a one player experience, in which you could do almost anything yourself. I haven't shared a system in years as these games and systems became more personalized and tailored to this kind of experience, which puts my score into perspective, but that doesn't mean I excuse it's flaws. I certainly feel for those who can't afford a second console and I want better for those who are stuck in that shared purgatory, but video games in general have come to a point where everyone has to have their own system, something that was very prevalent with handheld systems like the DS that only ever allowed one profile. Wireless connectivity has taken over and it's no longer the days where you would simply have your own memory card and put it into slot B, then plug in your second controller. So few games do this anymore where you can just grab a second controller and play split screen or do anything of the sort. I can't say whether it's good or bad that games are like this now, but for my personal experience with this game, I give an 8/10."
reviewsofanger,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"Let begin with we're in the freaking year 2020. There has been games like little big planet, **** valley, ect. great examples of sandbox games and ux/ui that is intuitive, but yet this game has no inovation and has features that can be programed by a monkey. Their formula has stayed the same since 2002 its 2020 for christ sake. This is just another low quality franchise like pokemon just churning game low quality games for a fat paycheck. WTF are they rendering or executing that they could not implement a standard of 2020. if this isn't the issue then devs speak up.

I dove into the game after my wife had her introduction to it. I spend 3 days playing the game just slowing grinding material, however I start to wonder, how do I progress in the game?!

So after avoiding trying to spill anything in the game by searching it up. I find out the game is severely restricted for any secondary inhabitant of the island.

This business practice is disgusting. lost all my faith and business."

FelisMoon,"Mar 26, 2020",2,"I wanted to like this game so much... but it has severe issues, enough to make it unplayable, to make a full review of the issues without spoiling even a thing.  Well, here is the first issue. You can only have one save game, one save slot, one island  in the entire console. You are forced to share the island with the other users  playing in your console. You change something in there, amd it will change for everyone on that console as well.  A bit crappy, because there is a lot of people that preffer to put dedication or enjoy to play alone or just preffer to not have their kids messing with the island and the things youve done but it can be tolerable. Except its not. Because the game implements a system where the first player or user that plays the game, is a ""leader"" that consists of granting progression lock to all other users. What do i mean? It means that if the leader player hasnt played trough some part of the game, no one else can ...  it hears like a joke, like, havent you thought the leader player could just abandon the game and force everyone to get stuck? Or just not play as often and delay the hell out of the other users? This game seems promising, but so many stuff limit you for no reason whatsover really, who thought it would be neccesary to force everyone to share one single save game, and at the same time lock the progress to all users except the one who first booted up the game? Yeah, because its not the user who bought the game but the one who plays it first. And yes, you guessed it, there is no way to change this ""leader player"" unless you delete all save game data and let the game as new and unplayed. Too many issues to be enjoyed just by a fatal saving system that nobody likes or understands why it was made that way."
KrolMyruh,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"A phenomenal game by Nintendo. It looks amazing and is one of the most relaxing games on the market. Everything you do is just so enjoyable.

Which is really sad because Nintendo have seriously f***Ed up the multiplayer and save system. If you want the full animal crossing experience, you need to be the island representative. If you're not the island representative then tough luck, you're gonna get a pretty bad animal crossing experience since only the representative can progress the story and gain new features. It honestly ****. Also one island per switch is a concept which should be opt in or out and having one island per switch just makes the representative problem even worse.

This honestly just feels like Nintendo being greedy. Only one person per switch can have the full animal crossing experience and if you want to have it as well, buy another switch and if you want to play together.... Buy another copy of the game which is a massive investment and one made out of pure greed.

Seriously, not a 0 out of 10 game but these issues are just too much and Nintendo needs to hear this loud and clear."

biancadace,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"Honestly this game got ruined for me. Today is my sister and I’s birthday, so naturally I let her play the game first since that was her present. None of the promotional material out there warned me about the extreme limitations any player that isn’t the first player to make the island has. It’s honestly so frustrating that we spent 60$ on a game that I can’t even play to the fullest unless I purchase a new switch console.

Another thing that just absolutely frustrates me is that there is only one island per switch, making it impossible for me to enjoy the game just as fully as my sister. I’m honestly considering never touching the game again due to these really trivial and frustrating game design choices. Nintendo should patch the game to make it better if they don’t want their sales to plummet immensely in the next week."
gogglebrains,"Mar 26, 2020",4,"After a week, I honestly regret playing this game at all. I put up with the slow early pacing, the clumsy core gameplay elements (effectively untouched since the Gamecube days), and the tedious and dull crafting system, because the level of creative potential that New Horizons promised was incredibly tantalizing. But like some sort of Sisyphean hell, true creative freedom is agonizingly restricted by the poorly thought-out mechanics, leaving me feeling miserable for having wasted my time in the first place.

New Horizons' most prominent additions are hamstrung by half-baked, outdated, inconvenient, and unintuitive design decisions, making them far too frustrating or shallow to be worthwhile.

The new terraforming tools, for example, give an unparalleled ability to treat the island as your personal canvas. However, by the time you unlock them, your town will be populated by around 15 buildings such as stores and homes, many of which you'll likely want to move once you gain the ability to freely create rivers and paths. In **** Valley (a $15 indie game developed primarily by a single person), the interface for moving farm buildings is incredibly simple and convenient: pick up a building, and pop it down where you want it; boom, done. In New Horizons, moving a building to an altogether new location involves paying a substantial sum of money ($50,000 bells) and waiting overnight. It's even worse If you wish to only move a building slightly, as you have no choice but to first move it somewhere else, then move it back where you want it (requiring $100,000 bells and two days; and you can only move one building a day). I play with time traveling, yet having to wait day after day after day to move multiple buildings around is still incredibly obnoxious even for me; I'm sorry for anyone who's actually trying to play this game in real-time.

Another botched new feature is the crafting system. Tools break incredibly quickly, and crafting more is an obnoxiously slow process. Resource gathering is shallow and awkward, amounting to little more than brainlessly smacking rocks and trees. For some ungodly reason, a crafting bench placed in your house cannot use resources you've stored in your home's sole Storage menu, meaning you have to pointlessly retrieve and later re-store multiple types of materials every single time you go to craft. In summary, the crafting system is incredibly half-baked, pointlessly time-wasting, and the minor benefit of being able to craft some simple furniture is capsized by the disastrously tedious tool replacement loop.

New Horizons allows you to switch between a front-view camera angle (as seen in New Leaf) and a more top-down angle (similar to the Gamecube version). This is a huge improvement over previous entries in this series.... and yet still comically half-baked by the standards of the broader industry. Why can't Animal Crossing just have the same camera controls that have been standard in third-person 3D games for 20 years?"

The game is still solid but if you’re not the island representative then there’s really not much to do because you can’t progress through the story/quest. Not to mention, even if you buy the game cartridge you are still not able to make a different island with other profiles on the switch so it basically limits you to that one shared island. Nintendo is wrong for this!"
amanda1to2,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"The 1 island per console concept ruined the game for me.

8bheotapus,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"Ideally this would be like the GameCube version, where every player could have their own island, but that's not horrible by itself.

I already own 2 switch consoles and two copies of the game but that still leaves me 4 short.  It is unreal that in this day in age you console lock something like this.  Maybe if all profiles on one console could at least have the powers of the Island Representative it would work.  Anything other than this terrible excuse for co-op.  That is why it is a 1/10 for me.

Jomarlazo57,"Mar 26, 2020",0,The fact that there can only be one island per switch. I let my little sister play the game before me cause she was excited and when I began to play I wasn't able to progress the game. It's unacceptable.
lostinmarbles,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"I bought this game expecting that my girlfriend and I could play together and enjoy our island together. Since we spend a lot of time apart at work or taking care of different chores, this felt like it could be a nice way to have a shared activity, if asynchronous, and chat about it later on. I was wrong.

Not only do you get limited to a single island per switch (which is a bummer, absolutely unacceptable in 2020, but I knew that going in), but the game is only for the first person to create the island. That's right: if you're the second person to jump in, you can't do anything. You essentially walk around aimlessly. What an absolutely garbage system.

So I bought a game that only one of us can enjoy. If you thought this could be a fun time for more than one person, this game is not for you. It certainly was not for me."

MorningStarn,"Mar 26, 2020",8,"I've been a huge fan of the Animal Crossing franchise ever since the original on the Gamecube and after playing this game for the past week almost non-stop, I think I can say that it's definitely the best in the franchise thus far without a doubt.  The game gives the player so much freedom and choice on the fly from changing the look of your character to choosing the layout of your island down to the ground and water beneath your feet.  Never before have I felt so free in an Animal Crossing game.

For how much I love the game, there are of course some downsides that many other users also are reporting.  The biggest of which that everyone and their dog is talking about is the 1-island-per-switch thing.  Now to be fair, this isn't unusual for the franchise, it has almost always been a 1 town per console game ever since the original on the Gamecube,  other than my sister who plays this game on occasion, I'm the only one playing so I'm not really affected too much.  Normally I would forgive this though since it's nothing new, I would forgive it if it weren't for the other issue that everyone is talking about being the limited Co-op.  This is a relatively new issue that started in New Leaf, where being the second player **** because all the cool things that allowed you to customize and play to your heart's content was exclusive to the first player, so it made being anything other than the first player essentially boring and pointless.  I would've expected Nintendo to be smarter this time around and remove that pesky quirk, there's no reason you can't have more than one mayor or an assistant mayor/Island representative that is capable of doing everything that the first player can do except maybe delete the island, but I guess that didn't cross their minds for whatever reason?  Again like I said, I basically am the only one who plays this game so I'm not really blowing a fuse over this but for anyone with siblings or loved ones who also play this game a lot, I can see how it's so frustrating.  In this situation, the problem is not so much that Nintendo is ""Behind the times"" (they are but still) the problem is more like Nintendo taking 3 steps back when it comes to Co-Op this time around.

Other than that, I think the positives still out-weight the negatives by a longshot.  The freedom to customize and change almost everything about your island is a huge positive.  All of the new additions are certainly welcome and the amount of quality of life changes regarding the menuing, the inventory system, the ABD and shopping, etc. make me wonder why I put up with the problems in New Leaf for so long.  The graphics are pure eye-candy, places like the museum are simply beautiful on the Switch to look at.  Playing with friends online is also a pleasant experience, although I do wish it was possible to play on other people's islands outside of your friends list for anyone who allowed that option.  Overall, it's a pretty great game for anyone who's new to the series despite its flaws, it is a must-have for anyone with a Switch IMO"
misselisa,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"Absolutely incredible game that not only makes me feel a little less lonely, but also allow me to have genuine interactions, going back and forth between islands and helping each other out, with my best friend, who is two continents over, in these scary times.

Yogi77,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"This game is great, I’d give it a 9/10.  Gave it a 10 for the nonsensical people ever thinking this was a true multiplayer experience.  It’s literally the only complaint about the game and people are giving it zero’s.  One ridiculous comment I saw “Switch is a family-friendly console, this is not a family-friendly game.  Instant zero.” The game doesn’t even let you name your character something obscene.  You can report COMPUTER NPCs for being semi-inappropriate.  How is it not family-friendly? Have y’all never played the game before? It’s a SINGLE-PLAYER LIFE SIM.  It always has been and it always will be.  The fact you can go visit others’ islands in itself is a huge victory. I’m really enjoying this game.  The crafting is great, the tiered crafting is pretty cool too.  The museum looks amazing compared to past games and I want to catch EVERYTHING! Nook miles are an interesting add, weird, but nothing too essential has been sold there thus far, and what has I’ve been easily able to get the miles for. Heck, I had over 10,000 miles within a few hours and I was playing leisurely (as it’s meant to be played).

I forgot the thing runs in real time, so it forces you to take breaks unless gathering and crafting and selling are your cup o’ tea.  Other games call in the meantime.  Great experience thus far about 15-20 hours (play time) in. Again, if you bought this and expected it to be a full multiplayer experience, you clearly didn’t know enough about the game and shouldn’t have bought it.  Your fault. End of story.  I recommend everyone check this amazing game out.  Hundreds of hours of entertainment."

omgwtfkitteh,"Mar 26, 2020",0,The one island per console has caused me to hate the game. I have no control over my girlfriend's island. What she says goes and I rarely to never get to pick villagers because she wants the perfect island. It has ruined my fun and I don't even want to play the damn game now. It's not review bombing if this is literally the way I feel. 'But they said it was one island in an article' Good for them. I don't read articles constantly.
Jutton1991,"Mar 26, 2020",2,"I can't believe the hype of this game. I have never been so bored of repetitive stone hitting, tree chopping, fishing and bug catching. Also the fact you can only have one island is beyond a joke, Nintendo should be ashamed to release this at full price. You should also not need Nintendo online to visit friends islands. This game was made for social interaction, something it tries it's hardest to steer you away from. One other thing is the washed up character on the shores who keeps coming back and making you collect his communicator parts. I have had to do this 7 times in a week. Why on earth could they not think of any other tasks. Everything is mundane and dull and I would seriously avoid. No idea how this got a 91. What a joke."
William8,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"Only reviewing this now because I have not stopped playing this game. I will be playing this for YEARS.

Not full of action like Astral Chain or Bayonetta but wow, it's just always brings a smile to my face to wake up every morning, explore my island, catch bugs, fish, gather, talk to villagers, visit friends online, etc. So much fun and perfect for quarantine time.

Dinosauce,"Mar 26, 2020",2,"Giving this a 2 until something is changed about some major aspects of the game. I love animal crossing, and bought New Horizons with the intention of playing it, and getting my fiancé into the game since she's never played. Soon after we discovered that she can't have her own island, make progress, or contribute to goals whatsoever since I launched the game first. She was excited to play the game, but now she's just sad and disappointed that she can't An option when starting the game on her profile should have come up. ""Would you like to play your own save on your own island, or would you like to be a glorified visitor?"" The other complaint that I have is that the online functionality requires you and everyone on your island to stop what you're doing and spend the next minute watching the person arrive or leave. You can't do anything while its going on and you have to watch it. Totally slows down and puts a massive break in the flow every time. Other than that I've mostly enjoyed the game. Just wish the multiplayer made more sense, and the multiple user profiles were individual."
Fainspirit,"Mar 26, 2020",8,"The game itself is very relaxing and fun to play, and has load of customization. if you plan to play solo, I highly recommend it.

My complaints arise when it comes to multiple people playing. I think that the decision to have one island per console, to build the community with those you play with would be understandable... IF other players had the same influence as the main player.

It is understandable to not want certain people to be able to modify the island, but it isn't an option to choose, extra players past the first are automatically restricted in what they can do. It seems like it should be simple to give the main player the choice of allowing others the same management privileges as they have.

In addition, recipes obtained through the storyline have no reason to NOT be mailed to the other players. It's silly and needs to be changed. Crafting is shown as a big focus, and losing a LOT of customization options for absolutely no good reason is ridiculous."

IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY THAT PLAYS NINTENDO SWITCH THEN DON'T BUY ANIMAL CROSSING!

We reserved the game hoping for a good experience but no, people should have a choice!
One of us won't be able to play the game and for obvious reasons none of us would feel well deleting our save in order for the other to play!
The game is cool, though not being able to live in your individual world ( and that's not the last of it, ) makes it impossible for others to play.
So one of us will not be able to play the game, and NO! WE WONT BUY ANOTHER SWITCH!

It's also of worth to mention that for me its a 0/10 cause i can't simply play it..."
Rallye_Man340,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"The obvious very big thorn here is the very poor application of limiting more than one player on one Switch from playing the full game. I bought this for my wife and I to play and as the second player, I cannot advance the game and am limited to minute tasks that make no difference toward game progress. Nintendo really kicked themselves here. I have always had very high confidence and trust in Nintendo until this point. If this is the stuff they’re going to pull, I will be very very hesitant on purchasing any future titles, which is sad. This could be a great game, but for a family wanting to play, the limitations bombed this score for me. What a disappointment."

Yeray101,"Mar 26, 2020",3,"Game is relaxing and quite fun sometimes, but that ""one island restriction"" is just killing the fun of the game for me. I share my Switch with my 9-year-old sister and we both want to have different islands, different progression, different furniture but we simply can't because of Nintendo. We even had to restart the game completely because I let her start the game first (I am 24 years old, I could play some other thing in the meanwhile) but then we realized that only she could really make the game advance and complete missions while I just could watch, so she agreed to restart the game so I could be the major with her help, but this shouldn't be the way.

She wanted to have her island so she could play whenever she wanted and I wanted to have mine too for the same reason. Now both have to share resources and we have to agree where and when to build important buildings such as the museum when what we wanted really was to have one island each other then visit the other one's island when we wanted to see what we were doing. I think that allowing to have different saves on a single console is not that difficult in 2020 so... c'mon Nintendo, don't be as always and let the players choose how they want to play instead of you enforcing things like this because I paid 60 freaking euros for the game and I want to play the way I want."
ElPsyCongroo,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"I was really looking forward to this game.

However, there is one terrible and well documented caveat: ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH.

The year is 2020 AD, and Nintendo who claims to be the most family-friendly console in existence has made a terrible decision fueled by their corporate greed. I wanted my wife to play this game too--but she can't because she'll be a glorified second class citizen of my personally created island and will be unable to make her own full progress and island creations unless we purchase another switch exclusively for her to play, plus another copy of the game.

I continue to question how people are not as bothered by this as they should be. The level of greed in this company has officially reached EA levels. Imagine, being a parent and having 3 kids who share one switch--guess what? They're screwed because kids aren't known for being agreeable; messing with another kid's landscape, or building in places where another kid may not want structures, the list goes on and on.

Nintendo fanboys will defend this decision (that was made in the interests of their corporate overlords; not for them, or you, or me) as ""normal"" in the animal crossing universe or as an overreaction by those affected by it. Guys, these are legitimate concerns and perfectly good reasons to be angry! I cannot think of another game that requires me to purchase another console if I want to share it with my household; because that's the reason console profiles are a thing since last gen consoles.

It is highly unlikely Nintendo will remedy this ridiculous situation. However, it is 100% fair for people to express their disdain by using this platform to voice their reasons for giving the game a 0. Our complaints are just as legitimate as the ""critic reviews"" who gave this game a 10 (despite the obvious limitation at hand which seems suspect, maybe those reviews are paid, who knows?), as well as voting with their wallets--for some however, it is impossible to vote with their wallets if they've already purchased the game and have no recourse for a refund (which is pretty much everyone).

That's okay, Nintendo is crying/laughing about this on their way to the bank and they know they can get away with this because you will gladly take Nintendo's virtual spit in the face and thank them for it."
Poochingus,"Mar 26, 2020",5,"It is hard to give this game a lukewarm score, but that is what ended up happening with this game.

From a gameplay standpoint, it is very surely animal crossing. It includes most of the features from past games, some which were lost including some bugs and fish. This is all nice. It is as expected.

The good:
-better graphics with dynamic lighting based on weather
-customization of your Island allows for making the exact town you want
-putting furniture outside for the first time
-nook miles gives daily and long term motivation to do many varied things in the game and allow for faster progress and reduce boredom
-You now progress more than just your house and the store, which gives a better sense of growth
-museum is way more pretty
-custom items are an amazing addition, custom hats, shirts, pants, skirts, face art(think adding facial hair) , and even ground tiles can be added.

The Bad:
-Made multiplayer very poorly
-multiple people in the same town cannot help add to growing the town, and can get soft locked by recipes that aren't given to them
-Island tied to your console, not the game save on the cart or even your nintendo account/profile
-you cannot transfer you Island(save data) to another console
-Nintendo refuses to provide cloud saves for no good reason(claiming to prevent cheating and manipulation, even though time travel is still possible and used heavily).
-Not enough new content. The game needed a new villager type or two. Needed way more new bugs, fish and fossils to keep me trawling the waters and carefully treading between trees. At that, different tree types would have been nice too.
-crafting only 1 item at a time. It gets tedious and annoying to craft tons of items in a sitting. No idea why I can't craft 20 fish bait at once instead of one at a time, watching the animations over and over. That isn't gameplay, that isn't fun, that isn't relaxing.
-Would have liked to see other static town NPCs make a return, especially bather's kin with the observatory and the cafe. The police dogs are also sorely missed.

This had the chance to be the quintessential animal crossing, but it failed on all fronts and just became another iteration, a fun one, but nothing special. It isn't a Smash Ultimate, but if you want a relaxing game or just a return to the series, it is adequate. Just don't expect to enjoy any multiplayer, this is a very single player game, and be sure you have the switch console you want to have forever, don't settle for a console you don't want, because upgrading either means a new console, or losing ALL your game progress."
hrrrnnng,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"Pretty good game, having a lot of fun personally, but I can't in good faith give a good review considering the hard limitations in this game, and some of the tediousness.

It's extremely annoying that there's only One island per switch. And to top it all off, only the first player can actually even do anything on said island. I love this game, so much I wish I could make a second island to make it completely different from my own! And besides my issues, there's a Ton of people out there who's switches are in households. Households with more than one person. Imagine a family with twins, or siblings, who get this game. Only one of them can play. And yeah, sorry but not everyone can **** afford two or more consoles.

And to my second point: the tediousness. I don't generally mind games being grind-y. I playing monster hunter for god's sake. But having to craft each fish bait individually **** **** ASS. I appreciate them at least giving a fast forward on the crafting cut-scene, but having to go through it + all 5 menus just to craft one item at a time is FLAT GARBAGE. Not to mention it's just  time consuming in all the wrong ways. Want to make a good fishing rod? Well guess what bud, you don't have a recipe for 5 sticks and 1 iron, YOU HAVE to go through the cut-scene twice because for some dumb **** reason nothing is streamlined.

It'd be such a better experience if you could A: Bulk Craft items like fish bait, and B: Have not just 'upgrade' recipes but also streamlined recipes where I could just make a fishing rod straight up with 5 sticks and 1 iron, the same amount it costs already, without the hassle.

Anyways yeah don't buy this game if you have more than one AC fan in your house, or get prepared to buy new islands for $200 minimum LOL"

Yes you can share 1 island, but that’s very difficult for children and while I would be willing to buy multiple copies of the game to have multiple islands it’s ridiculous to limit it to 1 per console.

NinjaBiker,"Mar 26, 2020",6,"Should have disclosed multiplayer limitations broadly. Having one player lead is bad, but not being upfront about it was the real issue. A few days in our primary player quit playing. I was stuck. I had to delete the island and start over in order to “fix it.” There is no way to change primaries apart from starting over which is dumb. We moved all our stuff to another island (we already had two copies) before blowing away 3 people’s savegames. Wish journalists would ding the game for this. Again, it was a design choice just like the one island per Switch. I don’t like it."
Vandyy,"Mar 26, 2020",4,Due to the one island limit and that the first player is the only one who can advance the story. Because of this it has made being a second player a second class villager. On top of that what was a storyline that you can do eventually a job as you are holding back your other players abilities. Making being the first player a job not fun.
Ukcjd,"Mar 26, 2020",4,Good game but the one island per console is a joke. Was really looking forward to sharing this game but can no longer do it as there's the one island. The second person has no power to do anything as well which doesn't make sense either.
Tonygrimlock,"Mar 26, 2020",0,My 11 year old daughter was the first to play.  Little did I realize that she would therefore be the owner of the island.  She got to name it and no one can change anything about it.  Nor can anyone else in the household have the same gameplay experience because you can only have one island per switch console.  I’m was really looking forward to playing.  Now I’m disappointed and upset that I wasted the money buying this game.
Wmsoberanis,"Mar 26, 2020",5,"I’m a huge fan of AC. This game is no exception. That being said, my biggest fault with this game is that I’m the 2nd player. I can not do anything unless player 1 progresses in the game or I just fork out $300 for another switch and I’m sorry but I’m not buying a 2nd switch just to be able to progress in the game. Not happening! I believe if they allow individual players to have their own island, this would solve most negative reviews. You could allow all players to make choices, but then you run the risk of players unable to enjoy the full experience of the game as players would start arguing when someone places something in an area they didn’t want it to go. I get that this would open up the possibility for people to cheat and create multiple accounts and have multiple islands, which seems to be the likeliest of reasons when I searched why this wasn’t a feature already. The only issue with that is, people always find ways to cheat and if they do than that hinders their experience and it’s their choice so why alter our experience to keep them from doing something they are probably already doing anyway? Please fix this issue, I’d really like to enjoy all this game has to offer as I did so in the past with all your other games!!!!"

Logan43000,"Mar 26, 2020",3,"I love the look of this game and wish I were leaving a better review.

Ray99,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"I'm not sure if this is pure Nintendo-style incompetence or unethical, malicious, money-hungry nastiness.  I prefer the latter because I can't imagine Nintendo is this inept  Here are the main issues which this otherwise great game which drag it down to the depths of cynical, corporate garbage.

1.  One island per switch?  What?  Completely and utterly destroys any hopes of playing with others.  If you're in a household with multiple people who want to play this GAME, think TWICE before buying.  This will create problems and essentially force you to both buy a second switch (or more) if you want to have the experience.  What are parents supposed to do with multiple kids who want to play?  Nintendo's plan all along was to have multiple switches per household, and they are trying to implement it in the most disgusting way, with artificially installed limitations.  There is NO technical limitation there can't be more than than one island per switch.

2 - Is there a way around it through coop?  NO.  Local coop is bare bones, pathetic, and an embarassment.  You have zero agency as the second partner, basically just following along like an idiot.  You cannot progress in any meaningful way.  So no, this is not an option for multiple people to enjoy this game.

3 - Online multiplayer.  Don't get me started.  I've never seen such a poorly implemented online from Nintendo.  This is WORSE THAN SMASH.  And that's saying a lot.  Firstly, you have to go to the airport, wade through seas of text, including the bird actually ""connecting to the internet.""  Is this dial up?  Then when you finally get to of a friend's island, and someone else wants to join, you will have to sit through a green message popping up forcing you to quit your menu, a FIVE STAGE flight screen for the plane to arrive (God knows why this is necessary, what is it loading??), a save screen, and a cutscene of the person walking in the airport.  This happens EVERY TIME someone joints the island, and breaks up anything you're doing multiple times.  Absolute lunacy.  Again, not sure if this is incompetence or purposeful - Nintendo is known to hate online.  This is their way of saying - Online is unplayable, don't do it, just buy more switches and play locally.  Also, why are there no mini-games to play with friends like New Leaf?  There is nothing to do with multiplayer online and things get boring fast.  Would minigames have been so difficult to implement?

4- No cloud saves at launch.  Apparently something is being ""worked on"".  Why not at launch?  Is it so hard?  Are they so concerned about cheating?  People are time travelling like crazy as we speak.  They could have easily imposed some limitation like one cloud save per day.  This is just mean, honestly.  Pure meanness.  Creates unnecessary added stress about losing your save.  Apparently a download will be allowed once, but who knows if this is true.  Why??!

These are just some of many issues.  What is Nintendo thinking?  They've been working on this since 2012!!!

Don't expect a patch.  Like Mario Part, Smash, etc. there has never been a patch that improves the fundamental problems of the game.

Single player is good but I have to give 0/10 for this because it can't be comprehended other than through a lens of cynical exploitation."
dbrandts,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"This game is an excellent social simulator.

For all of you complaining about the single-console multiplayer experience, I have some rhetorical questions below.

For the complaints about one villager making all the story driven decisions:  If you play this game as a family, does everyone in the family make all the real-life decisions or is it just the adults?  Does everyone pay for the bills, mortgage, decide where the kids go to school?  This game is a social simulator.

For those complaining that you have to wait for the main villager to progress so you can enjoy the island as the second player:  Do you not play together?  Do you all not enjoy real life together and usually make decisions together?  if you are an adult with kids, does the adult make most of the decisions or do the kids?  This game is a social simulator.

I understand the Nintendo Switch is very popular and there are many more new players to the Animal Crossing franchise.  These complaints are mostly from new players to the series because previous installments of Animal Crossing are similar, i.e., New Leaf.  If you played New Leaf and have complained on this site, not sure what you were thinking, and I can't help you.

In conclusion, If you want an adventure game where you share one console but have separate experiences, I recommend The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.  Because that's what you all are complaining about, Animal crossing is not Breath of the Wild.  All together now, this is a SOCIAL SIMULATOR!"
Gabe4Gaming,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"As a long time animal crossing fan, going all the way back to the Gamecube game, I've been having a lot of fun with this game. There are a lot of quality of life changes and the customization is amazing, the best it's ever been.

But my opinion with this game would be drastically different if I had someone to share the game with, and I can't overlook this fault even if I don't have to deal with it. Forcing each player to be a part of the first players town and then giving said players less abilities than the first is nothing but downright atrocious. This is made even worse when the very first entry didn't have this issue, allowing players to make towns based on the memory card used. Why was this drastic change made to the latest CONSOLE animal crossing when there was no issue to begin with? Is nintendo really that afraid that some people might try to cheat their completely cooperative $80 game? Who cares. Fix this issue, and I'd easily give this game an 8 or 9"
Icodia,"Mar 26, 2020",3,"Do not buy this game if more than one person wants to play on the same Nintendo Switch. The first person (1P) to start the game is the only person who can advance and actually play the story. Anyone else playing is a limited resident, they can’t even help out with the main story objectives. If you’re not the 1P, you won’t get as much access to getting Nook Miles, opportunities, or DIYs and you lack a lot of experience/fun that the 1P gets. Having to share a island is kinda fun, but when other people can’t contribute near as much as the 1P it’s unfair. The multiplayer mode is awful too. It’s a leader/follower style so if you’re the follower, you can’t access your inventory, collect things to your inventory, or travel together. I don’t understand the point of multiplayer when the other players can’t do much.Both players should equally get to play normally on multiplayer. Also, if you happen to lose or damage your switch, your game is gone for good because there’s no backup save or ability to transfer data."

I think it’s greedy for a company to take this approach considering some families only have one switch and perhaps multiple children or individuals who would like to play the game. The solution shouldn’t be for each member of the family to have to buy a separate Switch and Animal Crossing game. If this game were to be updated to include one island per account then I would change my rating to 5 stars. I really hope something is done about this soon."
Clampo502,"Mar 26, 2020",1,While the game is beautiful  and the game play is well designed I cannot over look Nintendo's greed. The fact that there is only one island  per switch is disappointing. it wouldn't be so bad if every player  after the first was not restricted  from doing in game story content. With out these story missions  the 2and player misses out on most DIY recipes  and cannot contribute  to building  the town. Seeing as this is the entire  point of the game its frustrating  that I bought this for my wife. And she cant enjoy the game because  of the limitations.  This was very frustrating  and demotivating  to her and almost  made her not wanting to play.  This shameless  attempt  by Nintendo  Nintendo to make families by multiple  consoles  is unacceptable.  Animal  crossing is supposed  to be about build and community.  Only the first layer has that ability  Unless this is patch ed I would avoid this game unless you are a single person with out family  members  that will want to play a FAMILY GAME .  I give this a 1

DudeLove,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"I'd like to get into the meat of the game, but I can't get past the extremely stupid decision to limit one island per Switch. PER SWITCH. I haven't gotten into an Animal Crossing game since the GameCube version, which didn't have this limitation. It's typical Nintendo; for anything they do right, they have to do something wrong to balance it out.

If you plan on only playing one-player, you're probably fine. But for anyone in a household with one Switch and multiple players, you're in for a bad time."
Grimzer,"Mar 26, 2020",4,"After hearing that you can only have one island per console, as well as the co-op experience being completely neutered, I won't be picking up the game unless it ever gets fixed."
capthavic,"Mar 26, 2020",9,"Fantastic game that does everything a sequel should do, i.e. take everything great from the previous games and then add even more to it. A wonderfully chill game that anyone can enjoy at their own pace. My only complaints are the one save per switch, and you have to pay for the online service just to scan and use QR codes. Not a big deal for me personally but still disappointing. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10 in my book."
Tharanox,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"I can't stop playing the game which is the most unfortunate part about it. I purchased the game and immediately fell in love, so much so that I spent the absurd amount of money on the New Horizons switch only to find out that I can't transfer my game data to my new console. Now I am left with a brand new switch collecting dust in the closet until Nintendo decides to get it together and allow save data transfers."
Digisplicer,"Mar 26, 2020",2,"Really fun and relaxing game if you're the only one playing it on the Nintendo Switch. DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE OTHERS WHO WANT TO PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT THEIR OWN SWITCH. Anybody else besides the first person to play the game on a single console is going to have a bad time. It's a single player game disguised as a multiplayer game. Each console shares an island so if the first player does all the things, there's nothing left for the other players to do and they cannot start their own island, there is only one.

Shame on the designers or whomever decided that this was a good restriction to have. It's supposedly to curb cheating... CHEATING, in a non-competitive game. Instead it just harms the others who would like to have their own island and make their own choices.  it also makes Nintendo look greedy because the only way to get your own experience in a family is to have multiple Switch consoles and multiple copies of the game.

I hope they get the message that people are really unhappy with this and feel swindled. Fix it please Nintendo."
Mbizzle,"Mar 26, 2020",4,"I don’t even care that the same console players must stay on the same island. My daughter is the primary resident and I take over after bed time, thinking I would advance through the games stages for the both of us. After paying of home loans, banking more than 100k in bells, and finding more that 25 species in less than a week; I was stumped as to why I couldn’t get the recipe for an ax or shovel. I even banked up additional miles to buy the DIY recipe pack in the miles store, only to find out that I still need those original flimsy DIY recipes to even access them. After much frustration and research , I realized what the problem was. So now I have to what ? Go into my daughters account, get her through the stages so we BOTH have access to new things. So what is the point of having multiple players ? Who would ever think this was a good idea ? I’m sure as hell not buying another console just to have my own island in the middle **** PANDEMIC. Bad form."
Ziphoroc,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"Normally Nintendo releases games in great condition with minimal issues on release. However with New Horizons I am frustrated with how rushed the game’s multiplayer functions. It truly feels as if the game was designed for only one player in mind, with the split screen added last second. The first player to play the game being the ONLY person able to make any progress to the island makes zero sense. Until you realize that it’s one island per Switch console, making it obvious that Nintendo is doing it for the money. Being the second player to play the game absolutely ****. You can’t even pick up items off the ground and have them go to your own inventory. You have to pass leader back and forth and if you accidentally pick up something while not being the leader, you have to go retrieve it from a recycle bin. The second player cannot even open their own inventory to equip items, they have to cycle through their favorites with X, and if you pass what you want you have to cycle through them all again. It just feels completely clunky when you aren’t playing as leader. I don’t understand why they didn’t simply allow the second player to also have inventory access, even if it’s one player at a time. It also makes no sense at all why each account can’t make their own island. Even if you buy 2 copies of the game, the second copy is essentially scrap because its all tied to the console itself. Bottom line is in order to let more than one person have the full game experience, they also must purchase an additional Switch console for their self, which is extremely greedy of Nintendo to do."

ascendedfish,"Mar 26, 2020",2,"It's a good game, but the first player getting to do all the fun stuff makes it unplayable for my wife and me. Nintendo please fix your game :("
MrRenner,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"Horrible decisions for multiple players. I bought this game because it's the only thing my wife will play. I let her play first and now, as soon as she gets bored of it, the game will stop progressing.  I can't restart the island because I want her to have the ""player 1 experience"" in the only game she has ever shown interest in.  This would be fine for a 20-30 dollar title. But for a full 60 it is unacceptable.

It completely overshadows any charm this game has.  And all the people saying ""its fine"" are people that aren't affected by the issue. I feel as if I was sold an experience tthat was not advertised as what it really is.  It is a single player game.  Players 2-8 might as welll be NPCs.  Nintendo laid an egg.

blueraysunshine,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"I was so excited to get this game for me and my kids. We all have enjoyed the AC games for years now. Imagine my and my youngest child's disappointment when we realized that the game my oldest created was now the ONLY iteration of the game we can play on.

The early Nintendo games packed tons of story and gameplay on tiny cartridges, but now with gigabytes of data available Nintendo made the decision to lock an entire console to one saved game. If they don't update the game to allow multiple saves--an easy fix with today's technology--I'll stop buying from them. The used cartridge market is alive and well if we really want a Switch game. Besides, there are tons of indie computer games available. I'm tired of supporting greedy gaming giants."

Benthefry,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"It is such a shame that you don't get an island per account. I mean, we get along fine, and our first reaction was that it was a shame not to be able to fill each our museum, or to just fully control our characters when we both play at the same time.
Not having two islands unless you buy two consoles is greedy and is a big let down!"
avonkorff,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"This game is marketed as being multiplayer friendly, and an experience all can enjoy and share together. It is not designed as such. Unless you are a single person, or are the ONLY person playing on the Nintendo Switch you download/install this game on, this game is currently in a criminally unplayable state. Currently, whichever Switch user account launches Animal Crossing first, is the ONLY account that gets the full retail game experience. All subsequent accounts have to play a miserable shadow of the game the customer paid for.

This design oversight is so heinous, it's causing many people, including myself, to wonder if this is actually a ploy by Nintendo to get people to buy more Switch/Switch Lite consoles. As a life long fan of the company it would be pretty devastating to watch them go the way of EA, Zenimax, and so many other fallen titans in the industry.

Extended Review:
The whole world is on lockdown right now, and a fun, relaxing, life sim type game such as this sounded like a great way for my wife and I to enjoy some decompression time together. Not the case. I spent $60 dollars on the Nintendo store only to find that we had to share one island (not a problem) but that only ONE of the profiles on the switch was able to progress the story, and advance our island's progress.

My wife was the first to launch the game. I made my character and started building my only little house on the island a few hours after she had some time with the game. Fast forward 3 days, and now I find that I cannot help settle new villagers, I cannot be given tasks by varying NPCs, I cannot contribute/have a say to the layout of new buildings and terraforming on the island, and a result, I've paid $60 for the pleasure of farming materials to trade to my wife's account for use as she deems fit.

This is a wholly unacceptable state of the game and legitimately needs to be patched. I will be following up with my credit card provider tethered to my Nintendo Online account (bought the game on Switch store) and asking for refunds on the same basis that hundreds of thousands of Fallout 76 players got their refunds for: consumer ethics breach.

Nowhere in any advertising or marketing material was I given the impression that only one person in my household would be able to fully play the game. I'm not talking about a subjective ""enjoyment"" of the game...I am referencing the clear and simple fact that only one account per Switch has access to the entirety of the game that was sold for $60 USD. Secondary, tertiary, and all subsequent accounts will have a miserable, gated experience and have 0 agency over the ONLY island the entirety of the household is allotted.

Without a clear disclaimer being present prior to purchase, this is unethical and either needs to be patched or customers need to be refunded. Until either happens, this is a 0/10, awful, regrettable purchase for anyone not living/playing alone on their Switch."
TheeDannyB,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"If you want to share your new game with someone else in your household you have to buy another switch, and this particular moment due to horrible pandemic we are all going through a new switch can set you back upwards of £500."

There is no player 2 in this game, you don’t get to play. You’re living off someone else’s game, totally missing your mark. Losing fans, losing customers, losing the people that made this 3x larger in sales than your other games. Honestly, where do you get off I doubt people will come back next time for Animal Crossing if this isn’t fixed."
TantheTaxman,"Mar 26, 2020",2,I got this for my Brother and i. He played just long enough to save before handing it to me. I was unable to progress past where he had got in the story.

Once the hype train slows this game with show it's true colors. Don't hate it just very disappointed.

firey_illusions,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"For all I know it may be an amazing game. However, after playing it for an hour, I was bored to tears. Even new leaf wasn't as boring in the first hour and I disliked that animal crossing too. I've played every animal crossing game and have to say that this one just didn't interest me. The most important role for any media is to hook the players, and this game failed miserably in that regard."
carolynpal8,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"Me and my boyfriend got in this huge fight because we went out, bought the switch and New Horizons. Just to find out only one of us can play, TRULY PLAY. It’s so frustrating, the POPULATION ARE NOT IDIOTS. We understand that this is a PLOY TO GET US TO BUY MORE NINTENDO SWITCHES. You think that this will get you more revenue? No, in fact it will hurt your game because there won’t be as much users playing at the same time. Why does anyone want to share an Island together? The beauty of the game is being able to create whatever you want and express yourself. Also the fact that the game is in real run time ABSOLUTELY KILLS IT. Are you kidding me you’re going to make it only one island, expecting the players to share because up to 8 of them can live on the island? And incorporate the fact that it is a deserted island so there’s going to be nothing there, A LACK OF RESOURCES already? Honestly, made the decisions to change this, this is a family fun oriented game and what keeps it interesting is seeing the other peoples towns that’s what created spark. Nobody wants to play on the same town, there’s a lack of quests lack of everything. Your customers are even trying to get refunded their money because of this, it’s absolutely disgusting.


UPDATE

We tried playing the CO-OP on screen that they had an it was an ABSOLUTE FAILURE. They made one of us each be FOLLOWER AND LEADER. The FOLLOWER COULDN’T ACCESS INVENTORY, OR GO TO NOOKS & BUY STUFF IT WAS JUST THE TOOLS. SERIOUSLY NINTENDO! THE FOLLOWER COULDNT EVEN TALK TO THE RESIDENTS EITHER. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT."
Aeolianmode,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"After playing for a week, I realized I have more fun with New Leaf. New Horizons has bafflingly removed core features that were present in New Leaf, and the pacing of progression feels artificially slowed down to hide the lack content. This is coming from an AC veteran who knows what's missing and also knows what a more fun pacing for this type of game feels like. The customization is deeper and far more fleshed out, but this feels like it was at the expense of some gameplay features. While relaxing and charming, if you want the purest core AC experience, dig up a 3DS and get New Leaf.

That would be my 7 star review. But here's the kicker.  Reviewers haven't discussed this because they tend to not share their consoles with a family. As a single player I am having a good time with the game, but the inability to allow multiple users their own islands is moronic, greedy, and especially cruel to low income households.

As such I have put my score at 0 to help send a message to Nintendo. Be kind to families. Especially during a time like this, while a worldwide pandemic threatens everyone's normal life. Fix this, Nintendo, and I'll adjust my score."
Gamer1989,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"Looks cool, my husband has a great time playing, but unfortunately, they only allow 1 island save PER SWITCH. So I will never know what it's like to play how I want to. Got super excited to start and was dropped on to his already populated island. A real let down. Shame in you Nintendo, you know this is a greedy tactic."
Dtrixtreme,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"I made an account just to review this game. Because of my disappointment

I am a solo player who was entering this franchise for the first time. So the single island per console thing doesn't effect me, but in an era where other games can have as many procedural generated worlds as people can fit on their console hard drive...that makes absolutely no sense. And these islands are tiny.

My first impression of this game is that it forces you to play it how IT wants you to. I have repeatedly changed my in game clock on my switch just so I can progress the game, and when you consider that you can hit the first time gate in 40 minutes, it puts you in an awkward position where your first day of the game is just shaking tree's and catching bugs and fish while trapped in the starting area. I felt like I was playing an early access title.

What's worse is you are punished for your progression initially. You get locked out of content because the game decides you've done enough of it and then doesn't let you back into that system for 48 real world hours. At one stage you are not allowed to buy key items used in repeatable achievements because you are playing the game at the wrong REAL WORLD time. And this makes no sense when you consider the first version of the shop is available 24-7.

The control mapping is bizarre, the tool system, which is arguably the most important system in the game is bound to the D-pad instead of the back buttons, which is annoying when you consider that fast moving insects exist in this game and you have to stop moving to swap to your net. Also the phone being bound to ZL instead of + symbol makes no **** + symbol is only used to access a specific menu in the **** central buttons on a controllers are universally used for key menus in most modern games so why was this an exception?

To further add to the clunky issues with the game, the shop system puts filler dialog in everything, and only allows you to buy items in 1's or 5's, while some repeatable achievements require 3 of the item, so you either buy 5 to save time, or buy 3 increments of 1 just to save money. I don't know if future upgrades to the island make this simpler, but if that's the case, why on earth would game designs make players have to unlock intuitive design?

If not for the returns policy of the retailer I bought this at, I would already have returned it. I will continue to play my $69AUD investment to the endgame and may change my review depending on how the mid-late game is."
3nd3r02,"Mar 26, 2020",2,"Even though the game itself is great and as gorgeous and fun as any of its predecessors, I can't think of any reason why Nintendo could have thought that ruining the experience of any other player except the 1st one was a great idea. I would love to give it a much higher score but the fact that the 2nd player becomes so dependable of the 1st one and misses out so much makes this animal crossing worth much less."
clarth2,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD THAT WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME. I dont even care, and even expected there to be only one island. The only issue I see with a 1 island limitation is that it is tiny with no room to expand. The big issue is that Nintendo gives one user per switch a completely different experience than anyone else who wants to play the game. I would say the new features and aesthetics are great , but they don't even matter when you have a game that is fundamentally broken at its very core. For example, I am the second player to start the game and decided to help player 1 with getting furniture for new houses. I  didnt get any DIY recipes for the items needed, and when I went to check the boxes for what was needed to create houses, there was zero info. Tom Nook just told me to talk to player 1. What is wrong with the developers to make a decision to encourage collaboration, but  only allow 1 player to have the resources to contribute?
I love Animal Crosssing games and have played from Gamecube to DS to Wii. This game was clearly designed to push families to purchase multiple Switch Lites, and gives the middle finger for anyone that wants to fully experience a flagship game on their flagship console. There is even a great irony and an, ""F you,""  when  they actually give you a Switch console furniture piece for  you starting  your life on the island.
Congratulations Nintendo, You have successfully ruined  a beloved title. I wont review bomb and rate this at zero because everything else seems like it is **** player 1. Otherwise, I will think twice about buying a game with Nintendo's seal of approval."
NateWheeler,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"My sister bought this game not knowing that we couldn’t have separate islands. This was a problem because I was the first one in my family to play the game, and I even got pretty far. The fact that I had progressed up to the construction of the museum ended up being a problem because as my sister found out she could not register new creatures with Tom Nook and so she was stuck using a flimsy rod and net on half of the island. This mad my sister very upset seeing as she had just payed $90 to play this game and now she was stuck on 2% of it. After searching many websites I found that there was no way for her to get a new island or even tools so I made the decision to delete the file I had spent hours on so that my sister could play. Come on Nintendo stop being petty and forcing people to buy a new switch just make it so people can have multiple islands on your family console."

But I can't even contribute to building the houses for the new residents which made my interest in the game drop immensely. Feels like the first player is getting a lot more out of the game which **** in my opinion. At least make it optional so everyone can contribute and everyone gets the same furniture and all..."

I hope Nintendo decides to update the game to fix this issue by at least allowing players to switch who is the Resident Representative for an already existing island."
IslandCrossing,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"When my partner first told me about Animal Crossing, I was kind of excited. I’m from a tropical region and, while I hadn’t played it as a kid, I had played Harvest Moon, and the prospect of making my own cute farm island was a reassuring way to pass COVID-19 quarantine. The reality was not cute. My boyfriend didn’t think I wanted to play for some reason and set up the island and stripped  it of all resources. I had no idea how ACNH worked so I started a save file thinking I would either get my own island or have different resources generated for my file, or like anything a reasonable designer would think of, right?
Instead of starting with a tutorial explaining what choices would be permanent and unchangable, I got a message that just told me to put my tent down. Noticing all the trees were bare, I confusedly put my tent close to my bf’s and tried to figure out what to do.  After running around breaking my flimsy tools for two hours trying to get wood and stone that wouldn’t spawn, I looked up what was happening. Not only was there no way to respawn resources other players had hoarded, accidentally or not, as the non “representative resident” I couldn’t donate to the museum until it was complete and I could not build the store nor decide where it was placed. I also learned that expanding our houses was impossible if they were too close, which seems like vital clarifying information in a game aimed at children.

We tried playing for a few days but even though we were communicating it was not working out. We play video games very differently. I am impatient. My partner doesn’t like to put much thought into games or rush. I found out that I could time surf but my partner doesn’t want to do that since he is, apparently, “an animal crossing purist” or rather he doesn’t want the villagers to be “mad at him for cheating.”

For those who are reading and saying “so what you’re just not trying to cooperate” we really are and ACNH doesn’t really provide anything to help with that! There’s no shared inventory pool so multiple players can easily contribute to helping build up the town.
In order to send resources to other accounts on the same system you have to either mail them per item for 200 bells each (time consuming and not cheap x 12 items per day). Not exactly helpful. So after two days I had switched to hitting Nook miles achievements and using all my miles for nook tickets so I could actually like, get anywhere in the game without stripping the island of resources he needs to build the town. My partner was surprised I payed off my home loan before him. I told him I was using the Nook tickets like a revolving door to rack up achievements and resources. He said he had not used a ticket yet and had just bought hair styles. He was embarrassed to tell me this.  I realized I was making him feel bad about his playing style just by him having to watch how I play. I normal speed through games faster than he does but he never has to play the same file I do until ACNH. We had thought this would be a fun bonding activity while we were locked in but it wound up being stressful and anxiety inducing.

The feeling we had fostered around the game was not one of shared joy and reassurance, but unease and mutual resentment, I resented that I could not run the island and build the town and my boyfriend resented seeing the rushed way I was playing since it took the relaxing element of playing away from him. So yesterday, I emptied my inventory out on the ground and deleted my Animal Crossing file. We have pretty good communication and lots of other games I enjoy so while upset, I’m know my ACNH experience isn’t as bad as it could be. I know if I was a kid ,who are the ~main group~ this game was made for, who had to share this with a sibling while in quarantine I would be crying. Even if we bought a second cartridge we can only have one island per switch system.
Half the world is unemployed for at least a month, does Nintendo really expect people to buy second and third switch systems to play one game fairly?

TLDR: I rate this game 0/10 for worsening an already traumatic experience of being trapped in my house with no control over the world, and making my partner and I feel bad for just wanting to play a game differently. Bad user experience design for no easy item sharing while demanding people share an island. This was frustrating as adults with good impulse control, I cannot imagine how infuriating it is for the target audience of children and teens."
Crimsonfangss,"Mar 26, 2020",3,"Would easily be a 9 or 10... if I wasnt completely unable to progress for letting my little sister play first, meaning she is resident rep. She swears she is never asked to complete the tasks needed, or else it's unclear.  All I can do is spend nook miles to farm resources before handing the console back to her. Worse still, only the resident rep is given crafting recipes, so no ladder for me..... would like to know went diving is gone to, as we were looking forward to it."

Tuckerbox,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"I cannot believe this game will only allow 1 island per switch. Not even 1 island per game card, which even then is ridiculous. I want to play this so badly but to do so I need to buy a WHOLE other switch? Despite not agreeing with even needing another game card at least it would mean I can still enjoy this game and I would have totally done so. This greed by Nintendo is very disappointing to see as I have always been such a big fan of them. The entire premise of the console is to be for family and sharing yet they pull a stunt like this. Very disappointing Nintendo I hope they fix this soon."

Hanlond,"Mar 26, 2020",0,Gameplay is determined by the first login.  They pick the island and all other users exist on their island and have a completely frustrating game play experience.  Save your money.
Eldurjn,"Mar 26, 2020",0,I bought this game and my husband unlocked pretty much everything already. Now I wanna play but it only allows one island per person. Even if I buy another copy of the game it would not let me have another save.
evan22,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"This game is great for one player. As dozens of other reviews say, the problem starts when you have multiple people in the house. My girlfriend was just as excited to try this game as I was when we got it, so you can imagine the disappointment for both of us when we discovered how there can only be one island. As player 1, I spend most of my gameplay feeling guilty and feeling bad about making decisions that she’s not allowed to participate in or trying to balance between wanting to do everything but not wanting to take all the resources from her. As player 2, she spends the gameplay basically just being a visitor to the island, never able to make any actual changes or shape the island how she really wants. She’s also locked out of many little tasks (such as helping Gulliver). This simple mechanic that would be easy to fix in an update has truly ruined the experience for both of us. The fact that Nintendo is trying to use this as an opportunity to sell more switches is absolutely absurd and it’s honestly really disappointing. It turned what should have been a happy and fun experience for us both into a really disappointing one all in the name of corporate greed. Shame on Nintendo."
Bobyjane,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"Obviously a cash grab from Nintendo.   Anyone who played animal crossing before shouldn’t expect the same experience with this.

And to all the review bombers... Even a bad amount of research would have told you everything you're complaining about MONTHS in advance. We already knew there was only one island per console and that you'd have to play with each other or have multiple consoles.

UVsensitive,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"Bought the game digitally because EB games was closed. Playing on my old switch instead of switch lite because it can connect to TV. But since my old switch isn't my main, it has to be connected to the internet to see if I can play my own game. So I can literally only play at home.I wanted to be on my old switch so my gf can start and account and I could help her. But she doesn't get to experience any of the game. Now she has to play on my switch, while I play on hers. Once we buy 2 more physical copies so we can  play.

bruhmoment2,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"I've never been a HUGE fan of the franchise, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons quickly caught my attention with its gorgeous art style and large amount of content. Above all that, this is the most fun I've had with any switch game, and it's also the most relaxing game I've played in such a long time. The sheer amount of joy this game emits will put a big grin on your face and urge you to play more. As soon as you think there isn't anything to do, just talk to Tom Nook and he'll give you at least three different tasks. Albeit the start of the game is a little slow, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons is absolutely brilliant, the perfect escape to our current quarantine situation, and is already a GOTY contender."
LyoreC,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"I love sharing a game with family members, only to find out the first person to play the game is the only person who actually gets to experience the game fully.

I only played the game for an hour and I want that hour of my life back, thanks Nintendo."
warc9,"Mar 26, 2020",9,It's a fantastic game. Just fun to play. Nice and relaxing.  The Island is a bit small but it doesn't change the overall fun of the game. People have been giveing this game a 0 just beacuse it only gives you one island per switch and while that could be a minor annoyance it doesn't take away from the fun of this game at all.
Patacorow,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"The main game is great, a classic Animal Crossing experience with tons of new features and a great setting. It really is a lovely game.

However, problems begin to surface when you want to play with another person. I purchased this game to make the corona quarantine easier for me and my gf, but as soon as her character arrived at the island (I arrived first), we found out she was nothing more than a 'secondary' citizen.

She couldn't get new DIY recipes, participate in new projects, put things in the museum or even help with existing projects. Her progress was limited by mine, and since I don't play as much as her, she basically got a watered down version of the game.

This is obviously a conscious design decision on Nintendo's part to encourage players to purchase more Switch consoles, since you cannot have more than one island on the same one. This creates a TERRIBLE experience for anyone who is not the first player - I can only imagine how much this would **** for a whole house of people who want to play together.

This is similar in vein to how the online features are locked only to players with an online subscription. If they are not present - other local players can't play online, so the only way to work around this is to create the online subscriber's character in local multiplayer using another controller, and then just have them stand around, allowing other players to use online features. Again, a stupid, GREEDY design decision by Nintendo."
TalkNoJutsu,"Mar 26, 2020",0,This game is as wonderfully entertaining as it is broken in forcing people to buy multiple switches and copies of the game to play it to it's fullest. Nintendo are being completely trash with the way save games are being handled with this game and forcing only one Island per console.
LPDani,"Mar 26, 2020",1,"EDIT:
Some people just refuse to understand the situation so Im going to copy it directly from nintendo support:
Is there a way to create multiple islands?
You can only create one island per Nintendo Switch system, even if you use multiple games. A different system is required to create a different island.
The island save data is saved on the Nintendo Switch system, so there will only be one island (save file), even if different games are used on the same system.

If I purchase a second system, can I transfer the save file (island data) to a different console?
Animal Crossing: New Horizons does not support the ability to transfer your save file from one Nintendo Switch system to another.

Is this game compatible with Save Data Cloud?
This game does not support the Save Data Cloud functionality of Nintendo Switch Online.

When multiple players live on one island, does everyone have access to the same places and items?
There are some tasks on the island that the Resident Representative (first resident on the island) must complete before the related features will be open to other players. For example, only the Resident Representative can receive and set up Blathers’ museum tent.
It is not possible to reassign the Resident Representative role to another player. If certain places or items in the game aren’t available for island residents, have the Resident Representative progress to the point where the item or feature is available for them, then try again.

So for people who are trying to defend this by saying this was always the case with the franchise, firstly its not true, secondly its frikkin 2020, there is literally no logical reason for not letting people have multiple save files, the only reason is to make people buy new consoles.
If you intend to play alone, lucky you, but most of us don't. Think of a couple or a family with kids, don't tell me they should buy a new console for each family member just because ""the franchise was always like this"". Im sorry, but this is just BS.

Original review: Was looking forward to play this with my wife, then I came across the information that the game is limited to one save per SYSTEM, so not even buying two copies of the game is enough, I would need to buy another switch just for this game... wtf director Aya Kyogoku and Producer Hisashi Nogami ?? why dont you want me to buy your game??"
A_Mighty_Pleb,"Mar 26, 2020",5,"A huge disappointment and let down because of a bizarre decision to have one island per switch with all important progress and gameplay mechanics tied to the first account that plays it.

Context is important here as people seem to be dismissing this issue as not important. Co-op and multiplayer is not the issue, as some people might want to play the way it is implemented. The issue is that any other account on the system that plays AFTER the first person to open the game is FORCED to play a lesser experience that happens to be shackled to the multiplayer experience. It is then not an equapl, stand alone playthrough with all the features of one.

A lot of reviews are fair in their scores because they played the full game with no problems on one account. That is fine. But a lot of people have more than one account on their Switch. To say that the opinions on the game by people affected by this are unfounded is frankly ignorant and it doesn't address the core problem.

It's 2020 and we can't have multiple accounts play their own instance ****? Yes we can, Nintendo has just chosen not to here. For a game that is trying to be a calming community experience, It has only made me feel conned and frustrated and left out because of this.

As someone who is sharing the game with someone in my household, however being the second account to play, I am forced to be an observer to someone elses enjoyment of the game. If you are not the first person to play this game on your Switch you might as well not play it at all as you do not get the full experience. That is unless you buy another switch to have the privilege.

This is a frankly disgusting and pointless choice that only serves to ruin the experience for many people who buy the game and line the pockets of Nintendo. Even the person who played it first feels guilty for playing it, even though they had no control other it.

Be wary before buying this game; unless you play on your own switch, first, on your account from the outset, you will not have the full experience you expected when you bought it. I will be extremely hesitant to buy any future Nintendo games because of this.

On a positive note, the person who first started playing on their account on my Switch says it's a lovely game. Shame I can't play what they're playing."
LuckyAlfred,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"I have played the game for about 30 hours now and had a lot of fun. I see that a lot of people don't like the wait, but if you say that then why did you buy the game?

EldLiger,"Mar 26, 2020",3,"Animal Crossing has always been a charming, simple game designed to be a relaxing sandbox. New Horizons definitely checks all those boxes, even if it does very little to actually improve on the game's age old formula.

One thing I see as a big step back (or at least a completely stagnant characteristic on par with harvest moon's stubborn refusal to include same-gender relationships while indie games like **** Valley do it so well) is the island sharing mechanic. I see a lot of people complaining that anyone who complains about this just wants to be ¨boosted¨, to stop whining and enjoy the game. The only logical reasoning is that those people are so entitled that they cannot imagine the game was not made for their sole enjoyment or so socially challenged that they cannot fathom how a family might want to share a console while still having a full gameplay experience for all players.

While I will not rant on and on about how this is completely unacceptable, it does show that the developers either can't design a game that allows for separate and independent save files (a worrying prospect) or did not imagine that some people might like having their own, separate sandbox experience without either having to limit their own or other people's experience in order to do so, after multiple installments of a very family-friendly game (families usually have more than one people in them, and many will have more than one member interested in the game), which is brings me to believe that while Animal Crossing will always be able to deliver in charm, it will never grow to be better than what it is and will always be.

This might be the last Animal Crossing game I will purchase, unless I see some effort on their part on actually creating an evolving experience with each game.

TL,DR: Good and fun, buy if you have your own console, skip it if you have to share with someone else."
koort12,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"This game should be punished for ruining the multiplayer user experience in the name of increasing their console sales. This is not, and should not be acceptable to the current industry regardless of the quality of solo game.

BeanMachine,"Mar 26, 2020",4,"I really wish I could give the game a 10 but the decisions made in order to make money from this game are so greedy. It is intentionally set up to make people buy multiple consoles per household.

I initially got over the ""one island per console"" aspect, however the fact that I can't make any island decisions or lose out on DIY recipes because I didn't play first is ridiculous, there should at least be an option to change the representative of the island. Another issue is that the multiplayer aspect was heavily advertised but is really clunky and awkward. I was really excited for both of us to have friends on the island but you can't cross local and online play, meaning only one person can play while a visitor is on your island. Im just really disappointed because the game has the potential to be spectacular, and if you're a solo player with no other players in the household it is great, but rather than try to make the game as enjoyable as possible for everyone, they decided to make it less enjoyable for secondary players in the hopes people will buy multiple consoles."

Though I am honestly really glad that I can share the island with my siblings, but that being said, it should be completely optional whether you want to share the island or not. Finally, I don't really get why everyone are assuming Nintendo's intentions behind this decision; this was a thing for as long as I remember in the Wii days (Probably even GameCube?) to share the island/neighborhood with local users, and obviously Nintendo's intentions weren't for you to go buy another Wii; it was purely a game design decision that has nothing to do with forcing people to buy another console, and no one really complained about this in the past as much as now and that's why they never considered adding the ""feature"" of having multiple islands per console since they assumed that what's not broken doesn't need fixing.

Art3mis86,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"So let me start with saying that Animal Crossing New Horizons is a great game. The gameplay loop is satisfying, the music is calming, the graphics are cute and the mechanics are simple enough for anyone to grasp. If you are the sole owner of a Nintendo switch, do not share the console with others and are a fan of the genre then purchasing this game is almost a no brainer.

However there is a MAJOR ISSUE with this game and that lies within sharing the game with other profiles on one console. It's a massive shame that greed has taken hold of Nintendo here and has resulted in some extremely anti-consumer practices. Honestly, I expected more from Nintendo. Basically the first profile on the switch to play this game has the full experience (which again, is great), then the following profiles that play have a watered down version of the game, it's almost as if Nintendo are punishing those who don't own their own console. This practice is very old school and Nintendo are obviously way behind in this area. This is almost EA standard of ant-consumerism and they have bucked up their ideas in recent times. I seriously hope Nintendo sort this issue out, mostly because their greed and anti-consumerism is tarnishing and destroying the reputation of a very good game. For the reasons above I have to give this game a 0/10, such practices shouldn't be happening these days and especially from a company that is so family focused. Thanks for reading."
vincentrx,"Mar 26, 2020",0,"The game looks good.

Spankle,"Mar 26, 2020",7,"Don't listen to the salty review bombers.
The game is nice. It's relaxing and you can really get caught up in the collecting aspect of it. There are only two big issues for me:

1) They still haven't integrated an in-game time travel system yet, despite the fact that you can only play about ~30 minutes to an hour every day if you don't time travel using the Switch's system settings. This is frustrating because the developers know very well that half (if not more) of the players playing the game will time travel anyway, so refusing to make it an in-game mechanic seems like stubbornness. A lot of time is wasted when you have to save, close the game, go to system settings, change the time and re-open the game every 30 minutes just to advance to the next day.

2) As I had feared when the game was announced, the game sadly is not worth the $60 price tag, no matter how you split it. What it does do, it does perfectly, just like all the Animal Crossing games before it, but it just doesn't do enough to warrant the nearly-doubled price compared to New Leaf. There are apps on iOS that legitimately have more content than this game, and this game cost me a whole day's wages. In short, if you're a die hard Animal Crossing fan, you'll probably love this game, but then again, if you really are, then you were going to love it regardless of what I said. If you have not played Animal Crossing before and are looking into it, I would advise against getting New Horizons unless you are flush with cash. You'll get the same experience by buying one of the earlier, cheaper Animal Crossings or a comparable game like **** Valley or Harvest Moon."

Немного кривой мультиплеер (в плане удобства). В принципе из недостатков лично для меня ничего не выявил. Я получил то, что хотел. Не понимаю, почему из за отсутствия возможности создания второго острова полетело столько негативных отзывов.

Bradfordo,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"****/cBh8N9py this link sends you to a petition to get more than one island per switch. If we want to make change, we are going to have to do something about it. According  to most people who purchased the game and are not sharing it, they are getting an incredible experience akin to Fallout 3 (genre notwithstanding). The only reason I make this statement is due to the fact that if you are player 2 expecting to have as much fun as player 1, the second player on Animal Crossing: New Horizons is basically getting an experience similar to Fallout 76., which basically means there are no resources and no reason to progress through the game. The fact that this game doesn't allow more than one save file PER SWITCH tells me that Nintendo is trying to RIP people off, and I beware sick of these companies making decisions that try and sway people into spending more money so they can have the same experience as the other person in the house. Beware, even during a quarantine, only the first  account has access to do anything remotely fun on this game. If you plan on playing this game after someone else has started an account, just be weary of the fact that you are basically getting a watered down version of the game with no replay value whatsoever. I purchased this game, and now that I started an account after my girlfriend, I basically wasted 60 bucks, and honestly, I'm kinda thinking this is a sketchy attempt at getting people to purchase separate Nintendo switch consoles just so they can have the same experience as the first person's account. Nintendo, please do the right thing and allow separate saves so I can at least enjoy this game. I purchased this game for 60 bucks, but I'm getting a crappy experience because you all took away a feature that is literally in 99% of video games. I've never heard of not being able to have at least one extra save file. Change your ways or these 0 reviews are going to increase."

This building is beautiful! the fossil section is the coolest part in my own opinion, it has a very cool trail that shows how the dinosaurs evolved and what there ancestors are in current day.  Make sure you invite your buds to a museum date (and also to flex your fish you caught and they cant cause they are in a different hemisphere) and to show the beautiful and fun spaces around the fun place.

OK now here is the part where i get a little mad at Nintendo. Listen... I REALLY like this game, but it **** that my Identical Twin brother who ive played couch co-op since the Days of halo reach, cant own his own island. When i told him that he couldn't, he got excited we could live together... but the drawbacks are just too much...  now he just sits there across the room playing Doom Eternal instead of helping me bully a owl with insects for a hour or two.

Please Nintendo Let My brother have his New Horizon."
GoldenAbysses,"Mar 25, 2020",4,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautifully crafted game that stays true to it's origins... if you're the first player. I bought this game in hopes that I could share it with my sister, but those hopes have been crushed. I started the game up first, as it's sort of tradition for the older sibling to play the game first in my family, and I had no idea that I was taking away so much freedom from my sister by doing that. When I heard ""one island per console"", I assumed that the island would be the same on different save files. Both me and my sister could transform that island into whatever we wanted. But, sadly, the grim reality is that she can't do anything on my island. She can do the basic things: catching bugs and fish, shaking trees, paying off her debt etc, but she's left out of doing anything important. Any important progress, like choosing where the buildings and bridges go, is only reserved for me. She's not allowed to have the fun of collecting resources and building our island up from the bottom, and it has ruined both of our experiences. I feel guilty personally knowing my sister, who was greatly looking forward to the game, is extremely disappointed and heartbroken at this development. She can't have fun, and I can't play the game without feeling a sense of guilt. Nintendo absolutely needs to fix this. The game itself is wonderful, I've been having a great time playing it myself, but I can't rightfully advocate for this game when it's been such a huge letdown and disappointment for my sister. I don't even mind if they keep the ""one island per console"" rhetoric, as long as my sister has the same freedoms I do. If Nintendo wants us to play together, then why are they restricting everyone except for the first player? It makes absolutely no sense to keep true to the friendship and bonding aspect to the game if you're literally making that impossible by both restricting any second player onward and making couch co-op practically unplayable."
cesc_larenas,"Mar 25, 2020",3,"The game is great. Kind of repetitive but you can overcome it anyway. I really liked the game BUT, my girlfriend liked it even more and there's the problem. I usually share my account with a sibling so my girlfriend, after seeing and playing the game with my account, decided to step up and buy the game for herself, even when I already had it just to play it with her profile. Indeed, to share the island was great to her since we could be neighbors and she got familiarized with the island. But... there's just too much difference between the treatment I receive from the game and the one she gets. She just doesn't have any event for herself, they're all directed to me. So... Even if you share, you actually share nothing and that's unpresentable, specially when we actually got two copies of the same game. So... While my original score was an 8/10, I just can't forfeit the awful sharing system"
Flash14N,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Apparently I need to wait till tomorrow to continue playing unless I just want to fish and gather weeds. Why tie progress to real time? This is a fictional universe and I'm looking to get away from quarantine boredom. I would not have paid money for this game knowing it would be another Farmville. Silly bottlenecks have me playing another game and regretting lost money.
Edh586,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Bought this game mostly because my girlfriend wanted it and because it claims to have local co-op. It seemed like a perfect game for us to share and play together. I ended up getting really into it until I realized how big of a problem sharing one island is and not being able to have separate save files. This MAJOR flaw essentially makes this purchase a complete waste of money. If you are going to play by yourself, it is worth it but if you are planning to share this game with anyone in your house dont even bother. It is a complete waste of money and a terribly flawed game...unless of course you plan on buying another switch to share the game with someone."
Jamesmess,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Absolutely disappointed with this game. The gameplay is what you expect from the great Animal Crossing titles, however the multiplayer was heavily mismanaged. First resident is the only island member that can contribute to projects and design the island how they want. Every secondary character is basically submitted to being a resource slave for the first player. The game only allows one island per switch so the resources you gather daily can only be harvested by a single user each day. This severely limits the whole crafting gimmick of this game. I’d be willing to buy a second game to have another island but it doesn’t matter because the island is locked to the switch and not the game... :("
Beechs,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I bought it so my girlfriend and I could play. Well as in sure you are all aware, that's not how it worked out. I inabilty to have more than one island per console really upset us. At this point it's her game and I'll stick to my PS4."
Yigzatoth,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Game is solid, i'am giving a 10 because of the unfair review bombing. Otherwise i for me its a 9/10."
Ripfester,"Mar 25, 2020",3,"Local multiplayer is completely broken; one island per console and the first player is the only one that can actually progress the game (and gets free things that the others have to pay for). Woe betide the household that lets their young child play first, as they will not be inclined to work to keep the game moving for everybody else and you'll all be stuck in the doldrums forever."
Carlz0r,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"New Horizons is the first Animal Crossing game that has managed to keep me engaged for more than a few days, and I can see myself playing this one daily far into the future.  The mix between old and new parts of the 'formula' have finally created something that I deeply enjoy playing.  It's especially nice to have a little something pleasant to fall back on every day with the world currently going a little nuts over this whole virus situation.

I'm sorry to hear that the way of handling multiple family members on the same console is so bad.  Seriously, it sounds terrible, and I think this aspect of the game could have been done a lot better.  I docked one point off my score for you guys... but only one point, because it doesn't affect my experience.  If you're planning on being the sole owner and player of this game like I am, it's absolutely wonderful!"
Nudie,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"As a Animal Crossing veteran since gamecube days, i have to say this is the BEST Animal Crossing game made. It has charm, character and longevity, all put into one cute world. I would highly recommend you playing this game and not listening to the negative comments..."
BigNate28,"Mar 25, 2020",9,One of the best games Nintendo has published in years. Very addicting game play and charming characters. I know this will be a beloved game for years to come and not hard to say it’s an instant classic
Schuetzenhaus,"Mar 25, 2020",2,"So my wife never played Animal Crossing, I haven't played since the Gamecube version, I thought this would be great to play together.

Iearn that we both have to be on the same island despite having different accounts. I'm a little disappointed since we can't work on our own thing, but okay at least we'll be able to work together cooperatively right?

No. As the second player, I can't help contribute to quests. I couldn't help get bugs/fish to Nook, I couldn't help get materials to help build the shop, I can't help set up the new houses, I can't help build bridges, I can't help contribute anything to the game's story. I'm basically locked in progression behind her; I had to wait for her to get the axe before I could. I have to wait until she's able to build the shop until I can use it. Some of the little activities you can do for points are locked by story progression, so I'm stuck doing the same things over and over with no variety until she progresses the game. And that's so unbelievably frustrating to me since we can't have our own islands. I'm not even talking about simultaneous co-op. This is me playing as a second account.

What is even the reason behind limiting the second player? This does nothing but break the experience for me, and now my wife feels bad. It's a terrible design decision and I really hope it gets reversed at some point because it's absolute nonsense. There's absolutely no reason why a second profile shouldn't be able to get the same experience as the first. Either give me the little brother mode with limitations but offer me the option to work on my own island with full control, or if there's only 1 island let me help work on our island together without these dumb limitations. I'm just floored at how bad this is."
StellarShade,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This is an amazing game!! People have to many personal expectations. if you want to live on a deserted island this is the game for you. Its suppose to be about you alone building a relation with the island dwellers. Its fun and amazing. Don't listen to haters!! Life's a game, play it!"
wiipetsto,"Mar 25, 2020",10,I love **** progress is slow but that is normal for AC.... It is Relaxing and I found new friends
jaceheron,"Mar 25, 2020",8,As always this is a chill game. Lol to those negative comments. This must be your first ac game. Next time don't get hype without researching the game.
Bearislegendary,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Absolute **** I wouldnt buy this game ever. It is trash and anyone who buys it is trash
travisfisher,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I loved this game at first. My girlfriend turned me onto it as she had played the previous ones. I bought it for her on my switch as we live together and have been watching her play. She was having a blast so I I decided to join the fun! Upon starting a new player, I was shocked that I couldn't have my own island, but I thought that it wouldn't be an issue. So I joined her island and placed my tent, and started to gather supplies and fish. It was awesome! I played for 5 hours collecting all the fish I could and saving up money for the house. I figured I would help my girlfriend out and add to her projects to progress the island but quickly realized that my options for progression or helping progress were utterly null and void. I was disappointed but continued to play anyway until I could not go any further without my girlfriend (the main player) progressing forward. The next day my girlfriend and I were looking forward to playing local co-op, and I joined her game only to realize that my options for local co-op were also wholly lacking. Not only could I not access my inventory, but I also couldn't interact with anything. Not to mention that anything I picked up not only didn't get saved to my player, but it also didn't get saved to my girlfriends player; it just got shot to some community box in the Community Center. I was reduced to pretty much just following her around running in circles.

Safe to say that was the last straw. I went from being utterly enamored with the game, shouting praise to my friends, to being completely turned off. The only way for me to enjoy it would be to buy another switch for $300 and another copy of the game for $60, and I'm not going to spend $360 for one game.

The game is great otherwise, and minus the lack of multiplayer and almost disrespect from Nintendo to the 2nd player, I would have quickly given this game a 10."
Monav,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Absolutely wonderful game with fun stuff to do.  Great for relaxing,  customizing and learning new things. Take it a day at a time with this one."
Chaos80,"Mar 25, 2020",7,good game really enjoying it. really wish they made better design decisions such as making online behind a paywall and you only being able to have 1 ISLAND PER CONSOLE. whatever dude just annoying
Deividd,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Muy divertido, te lo pasas genial jugando y el tiempo vuela. 100% recomendable!"
sethericson,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"While the game works for players on their own console, the absolutely irredeemable policies in place regarding progression, multiplayer, and access to content make the game absolutely ridiculous to deal with. For example, there is only one island allowed per switch system, which on its own isn't bad, but when you learn that the player that created the island is the ""island representative"" and this account alone dictates the progression of the game, the entire user experience is ruined. absolutely ridiculous"
UPB-BOOMER,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"This Animal Crossing is amazing... As the one account that can actually play the game! Only one account can experience what the game has to offer. All other accounts get to build a home and collect. There is a story to be told and progression in this game that is not shared like the island is. The DIY is VERY limited as well for all other accounts the only way to get what the first resident  has is to buy a completely other switch. This is a modern game, no reason should there be restrictions like this on a game."
willowlily35,"Mar 25, 2020",4,"this is a game that I was looking forward to for months, and while the game itself is beautiful, there is one thing I can't ignore. I hate that I have to share an island with my family. It really pulls away from the enjoyment of the game. I don't get the same sense of accomplishment when the museum fills up. I can't control the look and feel of my island. everything is way too cramped. I just wish the game would have given me the choice of sharing or not. the sad thing is, I wanted to like this game, but I'm not having fun sharing.
If you're the only one on your island, great, you'll have lots of fun. If not it stinks. and this isn't even a game limitation, it's a switch limitation. that makes it so much worse.
the only way you can enjoy this game is if you're the only one on your island."
MustBeRyan,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Really fun game! An update on the older games while keeping the charm of the series!
Lucishungry,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"My family and I (mom and two daughters) were really hyped about this game because we have all had very strong attachments to past installations to the franchise. We were very excited especially because this game came as a gift from my dear brother, but lo and behold the game locked my daughters from continuation in the game AT ALL. Older installations would share the players in the same town, much like this game, but they DO NOT stop normal progress to secondary players. The most secondary players would have to endure is dealing with whatever name the first player gave the town and sharing a house that could be altered by all of the players on the game. Now, players can’t do so much as chop down a tree or purchase a haircut without going onto the primary account.    Usually these problems would be circumvented by buying another game cartridge to create a separate town, but Nintendo has decided to make the game CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE. Not cartridge exclusive which already has a hefty price of $60, but there is a required additional fee of $200 dollars minimum for a switch lite, which has very limited capabilities, or $300 dollars if you want a competent console. Us players will expect to have to pay an additional $240 to $340 dollars should ONE person get their own chance at actually playing the game within a reasonable capacity that the advertisements and previous expectations Nintendo has lead its audience to believe.   Maybe this could have been avoided because by simply not purchasing the game, but how should avid fans of the Animal Crossing expect this kind of product to come out as non multiplayer friendly? Others could argue that with the last main game, New Leaf, was single player and that New Horizon is technically multiplayer because there are multiple players existing on the same island. Keyword: existing, not playing. The game should be justifiably playable like, y’know, a game. No less a $60 game. New Leaf was advertised as your own experience and your own town because you are the mayor. This experience is uniquely yours and was advertised as so.   Maybe we are expecting too much. Maybe it’s too much to ask for autonomous gameplay for all of the players, despite that capability being apparent in other games on the switch such as Pokémon and on older AC games on inferior consoles, despite the switch being capable of running beautifully rendered and complex games such as Zelda BOTW, it must be too much for the game. Sadly, we were advertised, very strongly might I add, that the game would be capable of multiplayer in its many advertisements. We were told many players can participate in Nintendo’s “Island Paradise” when the reality is that only one player with a sizable sum of money can experience this “Island Paradise” while the secondary players are basically forced to watch as this “Paradise” taunts them for not paying the $300 gateway fee.   I hope that future purchasers of the game take all of these points into account and choose to buy this game if they are buying for a single person because this game is by no means suitable for a family or even a pair of friends as turbulence can arise from there being only one person allowed to play the game. My family certainly experienced turbulence and I wish this game has never graced our home. Furthermore, families with multiple switch consoles should wait until the price of the game drops dramatically because other games at a similar price offer so much more.  Tldr don’t buy Animal Crossing New Horizons if more than one person will play it."
Gull,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Game doesn’t let you keep multiple islands. It’s only one island PER SWITCH. If you have two people sharing a console don’t plan on both of them playing this. Can’t even buy two copies, nope, one island per switch. Horrible way to do it"
Agithor,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"even with the limitations, the game is still a solid game. an amazing game if you just want to relax and just chill. easy to pickup for casual gamers."
Bwyants,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Game is real good. Wonderful evolution for the series. Ignore any 0’s you see on here. Just head the warnings if you’re looking for local play on one console. Doesn’t take away from the games wonderful atmosphere.
NathanB_69,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I bought this game for my daughter, then had to buy a second copy and also a second console for my wife. Pure cash grab. 100% greed. Oh, and by the way Nintendo, congrats, it worked."
Pokegame,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Please stop the review bombing this game is beautiful and relaxing animal crossing has never supported more than 1  town nothing is changed by this game not supporting it.
kayleehuls,"Mar 25, 2020",0,It would be an awesome game if they fixed the multiplayer. There are two huge problems with this game that honestly breaks it for me. First: if you have more than one person on the console you all have to share the same island and all the resources. 4 people in my family have to share the same island and it feels so crowded. I wanted to be able to make my own island and customize it how I want but I cant... Second: player one gets to do all the main storyline things and you cant change it unless you reset the game....   Im player 3 and I want to to contribute but I cant. I am really disappointed which is sad because I was so excited about this game. I had new leaf on my DS and it was my favorite game. I hope this gets fixed but I doubt it will since its definitely a tactic to get people to buy entirely new consoles.
Alonso13,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Es uno de los mejores juegos para relajarse y jugar un rato día a día, es muy entretenido y si te enganchas no vas a poder parar de jugarlo. Sin duda alguna el mejor Animal Crossing que ha salido y un muy buen juego por si solo."

MrPots,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Can’t even play the game. This is overrated unplayable trash. Do not buy. Play **** valley instead. Much better in everyway. There’s no real character creation, story is super boring, limited gameplay styles and dated graphics make Animal Crossing: New Horizons one of the most overrated games of all time. So many regrets playing, not to mention coop and multiplayer is a lie."
SPudinA,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Una obre de arte que salió justo en tiempos de cuarentena, el juego tiene progresión calmada, buen soundtrack y personalización de personajes"
Bluenugget,"Mar 25, 2020",2,Only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff. The other players on the island can’t contribute and can only really gather resources. This limits every other player than the 1st one and really blows. I hope Nintendo fixes this.
PulseBlue,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing has of course improved itself with this new entry. New features like crafting, quick customisation, and being able to place furniture outside is amazing. And with QoL (Quality of Life) improvements, like the ability to expand your inventory and having resources automatically stack, I can’t help but recommend anyone who has a Switch to buy this game.

The only thing that stops me from giving a 10 is sadly the same-switch multiplayer, and the concept of it in its entirety. Having multiple villagers on one island, only one can experience the full game, but also stops others from getting further. This gives other players the feeling that they are missing 20% of the experience. From an other players’ perspective, this isn’t great, and the only thing that would make me happy is to just give each player an option to either join an existing island, or create a new one.

(Also with couch co-op, please allow followers to use the favourites wheel)"
anxietyscroll,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"0/10. The game has a wonderful ambience and, for a new player as I am, I'm liking it. But it deserves a 0 because I'm NOT GOING TO BUY ANOTHER SWITCH for every sibling that wants to play on my console. People should stop buying this game until multiple islands are allowed. Hope this decision ends the saga and kills the fanbase 'cause it was developed for selling consoles and not for the consumer. (Even more ridiculous, I did purchased 2 copies of the game, but it doesn't matter, they WANT you to BUY a new switch)"
fapppyyy,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Only one Island per switch. Secondary Switch profiles cannot make their own world, they can only play the game if they use the first world created. A stupid limitation. I'd return this game if I could."
DocMoney,"Mar 25, 2020",6,"The game is great if you plan on playing alone. There are no multiple save files to support multiple islands which creates a huge problem. Do not buy this game if you have multiple people who are interested in playing. You all share an island and all the resources. You would have to buy an additional switch console for any player who wants their own island. It comes off as very anti player.

I'm very disappointed in the developers decision to force people into the choice of not playing or buying another switch and copy of the game. What other game can you think of that would force a player to make that choice?"
metaldavid,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I am currently playing this game single player however I feel compelled to review this game based on the multiplayer experience. The decision to lock the game to one island per console is nothing short of a cash grab. I am a long time Nintendo fan since I received a SNES for Christmas as a child but this behavior disgusts me and I am reluctant to spend any more money with this company if they do not address this problem. Nintendo consoles have always been family focused machines that encourage multiplayer and this seems to go against everything they have ever done to date.

Sadly they have likely already sold enough units to cover costs and will simply ignore the outrage from their customers."
JoeQ_,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Where do I even begin with this game? Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the first Animal Crossing title I have ever played and I am loving every bit of it. I used to be one to shy away from the series because I felt it wasn't a game for me, but boy was I wrong. Everything about the game is exciting and there's so much to do every new day you boot the game up. You start the game off as a Villager brought to a deserted island with Tom Nook and a couple other of animal villagers. Right off the bat, you're assigned with tasks to keep you busy for the rest of the day. From fishing, catching bugs, gathering materials, crafting items, and expanding the village, there's a lot to do on such a little island. This game couldn't have come out at a better time especially due to the current state of affairs, but it is a game that has had me occupied since the day it came out! Visiting other friends' islands is just as fun and it's really unexplainable how great this game is. It's truly an experience everyone should enjoy."
Amyka,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Worst family game ever!!!! IT IS BASICALLY A ONE PERSON GAME.

Blahha,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Fix the multiplayer and it’d be a 10, this game is great but with a fundamentally broken multiplayer it’s almost useless in regards to the original purchase reasoning. Close to impossible to have meaningful play with my significant other and children. Need the option to designate other players are island representatives with full control and ability."
lazycomplife,"Mar 25, 2020",10,This is everything I've ever wanted in an animal crossing game. My only complaint is the durability on tools. Everything else is wonderful so far. I hope those leaving negative reviews actually get the chance to play this amazing game.
Fuzzyllama,"Mar 25, 2020",2,Hugely disappointed. We were super excited for this to come out. My husband downloaded it so he was the first to play. I got on later and I had to be on his island. Bummer... Well now I can't do the quests he's able to do. He works third shift so he doesn't play as much as I do. Please fix this!!
Knivesncrystals,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"Calming but fun. Very enjoyable for someone who plays many different types of games and was looking for something easy-going to play for about an hour each day. I did have to get used to playing in real-time, but its all good now"
CyborgDanny,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"The decision to limit one island per switch is an embarrassingly horrible marketing decision to get people to buy another nentendo switch. Meaning that each save file of this game costs about three hundred and sixty dollars. I wonder why nentendo would do that? O yeah, money.

Not only that, but second player on couch co-op is bafflingly aweful. all items picked up by the second player are sent to a box instead of the inventory for no conceivable reason."
Hawkeye1621,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"It's Animal Crossing! 'Nuff said! And to all the butt hurt players let me point out something;
Locking each switch to one island makes sense. It's the exact same as when it came out on EVERY OTHER SYSTEM. When it came out on GameCube, the Memory card could only hold one town. If you wanted another you had to buy another memory card. The DS and 3DS Games only had enough storage for one Town. The Wii only only had one town per Wii. Most of you idiots must not be dedicated fans, otherwise you would know that. Think, or at least learn about the product,, before you wrongfully try to bash it Animal Crossing has been a favorite pastime of mine for 19 years and still going!"
Kooter_Karnage,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Seriously could have been one of the best Animal Crossing expierences yet, till the shameless and relentless greed of Nintendo is once again thrown back in your face the moment you realize in order to have more than one island, you need more than one switch. Cmon, really... not cool"
acfanND,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"I started playing Animal Crossing years ago on the Game Cube, have played almost every version on every platform and have been waiting for a full console game for years. I am thrilled with this game and have been trying to pace myself. They’ve made enough changes to make the game fun to play while keeping enough of the traditional Animal Crossing pieces that there is still familiarity. I can’t wait to continue in the game, fill my museum, and customize my island!"

HowDoYouPlay,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"From a single player standpoint, this game is amazing. It has lovely graphics, as well as being jam packed full of content. The only reason this isn't getting a perfect score is because of the 1 island per console rule. I play with my sister, and I was the one who started the island. After watching her play for a bit, It was clear how the game satisfaction to both players were very different. She didn't get to decide where structures such as houses or shops would be placed, and it was a bit confusing at first to figure out how she could get the recipes that I had already learned by completing missions such as donating to Tom Nook. This leads me to my next point, which is how player two wont get as much satisfaction from the game as player one would, whereas player one had to complete an objective to gain an important tool crafting recipe, which has a sense of reward, while player two would have the recipe appear in the shop, not having to work for it. If Nintendo had added the feature of being able to have multiple islands per console, there would be no question that Animal Crossing New Horizons would get that perfect 10/10 from almost everyone."
Franky1993,"Mar 25, 2020",5,What an amazing  game super fun to play I grew up with Nintendo but i have never played animal crossing and wow i have been missing out. It's fun to play theres tons of things to do and kill time especially with the corona virus going on right now. But i have to give this game a 5 and that reason being is that well to start off i got this game for my wife she loves animal crossing. We were excited to play until we found out we couldn't have two islands you would need to purchase a separate switch to have two island's what a bummer :( and you're limited on the second player i hope they listen to the gamer base and change this because we are not happy. Please fix this! I'd give this a ten but the lack of another island baffles me.
Kael_Ebbs,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Game was great, until I realized you could only have 1 save. With progress locked to one character, so if you share your Switch with other users, you're unable to make any kind of progress unless the original character has done so. Nintendo expecting people to go out and buy another $300 console just for another Switch is completely unacceptable."

Novaliis,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Most of the negatives that are mentioned in some reviews here don't apply to me, because I am the only one using my Switch to play that particular game. I do understand though, that it must be upsetting for people with family in the household and one switch device, and now they cannot all enjoy the game the way they thought. To me, the game is almost perfect, the only thing that keeps me from giving this game a perfect score is the still not resolved issue with the cloud save option. Considering that Animal Crossing is a game that many people play for years, it would be terrible to lose all of the progress when your Switch gets damaged/lost or you simply would love to get a different Switch console.
Other than that, it is a incredibly cute game that keeps me wanting to go back and play every day, which I was not expecting, since this is my first Animal Crossing game I've ever played."
LordSpook,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Hey, first time Reviewer. I know that's gonna auto-discount my review in some eyes, but I've just never been insulted by a game enough that I felt the need to actually make an account and warn people. So please, take it from me, a genuine end user. It's not just pointless negativity. Something tells me the critics never played multiplayer. These dev's are trying to **** you. Now with that out of the way, let us proceed.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons promises to let you travel to and inhabit a deserted Island. It reels you in by telling you, ""It won't be like before, we swear!"" like an abusive ex.

Don't worry you'll be able to move houses and services at your leisure! (Eventually and for 30k/50k per building) You'll be able to terraform* the island to your vision. (Again, eventually, and not anything on the shores.) You can even live there with your whole family!* (If you don't mind anyone besides the first resident being treated like glorified visitors with a house.)

Oh but only one island per switch guys because... we want everyone to buy their own switch. (in a global recession because the average family has tons of excess money right now, and definitely aren't all living way below the poverty line. Greetings from America!)

Here is what they don't tell you:
1. Only the first resident can advance the main plot points, and unlock those features they lured you in with. If you aren't first resident, you won't even be able to see the recipe's for the objects/furniture you'll be forced to craft, in order to advance the plot.
2. You have to build everything on this island for everyone one. Don't invite people to live there cause it's gonna be you grinding all day e'ery day for the resources. Not really the Island vacation package it was sold as.
3. there is Inconvenience baked into the game. Half of the upgrades just get rid of some annoying inconvenience that you were just putting up with. Advance the plot (if you are first resident) to have a slightly less miserable time. I think that's a really lazy and corrupt form of game progression, used only by those that lack the imagination necessary to offer genuinely fulfilling progression rewards. I'ts like hide and seek but you get to remove your blindfold after thirty games (or something.)

Also ignore any excuse that these annoyances are in the game to ensure fairness, because there are already many money exploits in the game. So in the end it's kinda like the Games for Windows Live disaster of yore. You know, that time when Microsoft thought it was cool to sabotage the stability and enjoyment of their games in the hopes of preventing piracy, which happened anyways.  Hamstringing your product to preserve ""fairness"" is a fools errand. you might as well ask the sun not to rise.

So the main issue is, if you buy this game you are telling Nintendo that this is an okay business model. ""Naw it's cool, us consumers are total ****. Hey if another Zelda game comes out make sure that only the first person on the console to play the game can advance the plot. so you can force us to buy more switches.""

Other than all that total BS, it had some pretty enjoyable aspects. For one, you don't need to take a freaking personality test to change your hair color. (These developers are asinine.) And everything was pretty much 24/7 until we made progress. (then it went back to their traditional stance of, **** night owls."") But as soon as I found out the game was just gonna treat me like a chump indefinitely, like unpaid labor, it kinda drained any aspect of ""working for fun"" from the game."
al-less,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Not a REAL multiplayer game!  Do not buy as a family game or you will have frustrated players.  Only the first islander can play this game fully.  All additional players can only play a partial version of the full game.  They need to FIX THIS BUG!  I bought this for my family and only 1 person gets access to play the full game.  Would not have bought if I had known and I have loved AC for years!
Kingjavabean,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"This game is extremely cute, I’ve played it every day since release and I can’t get enough."
Takkenno,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"It would be a great game, if you would be able to create a new island for every player. But this way it's just not acceptable."
Oslith,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"I got New Leaf a little bit back and loved it so I was so excited for New Horizons. SO WORTH IT! It's exactly what I wanted and more. If you like Animal Crossing or have never tried it, give it a shot. Very charming, calm, and gives you things to do everyday.

Also Imagine review bombing this amazing game just because you didn't properly inform yourself on the game and only having one island. Is it a bad feature? Lol yeah. Is it worth a 0? HAHAHAHHAHA no. One bad feature doesn't mean the game is awful."
laheilig,"Mar 25, 2020",4,I really enjoy this game. I bought it as soon as it came out and started up my island. That evening my sister decided to pop in and play with me. We were baffled at the limitations of the second player. As we've progressed I keep finding things that she cannot do or participate in. I hate that she feels left out or completely unable to play with me. Very annoying and sad.
Darun,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Im sorry but its total bs to just have one island, otherwise the game is perfect"
cringeyboi555,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"**** piece of **** stupid **** one island mechanic. You can only have one Island at a time, and the second player gets to do nothing. **** you Nintendo.

9/10"
Shi4shi123,"Mar 25, 2020",10,The game is a much improved version compared to others. Friends and I have played it almost nonstop since it came out because of how much there is to do at any given times. The customization features are phenomenal! Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy breezy game to relax with .
MichaelJS,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"When I first heard about the Animal Crossing series, I had seen tid bits from some youtubers and talks about New Leaf and Pocket Camp. I got Pocket Camp on IOS and played it for a maximum of 20 minutes. It was simple and bland and turned me off the series while i still respected it. I thought it just wasn’t for me. Boy was I wrong (And i should’ve assumed that the mainline games were much better than the free mobile game). When Animal Crossing New Horizons was revealed, i thought it looked charming and was interested in giving it a go and i’m so glad i did. So far this game has been a magical experience. Watching the deserted island grow into a thriving society is very satisfying. Gameplay is so calming but also engaging. The game starts slow and  progresses while you complete tasks, fish, catch bugs, pick weeds, and build houses for upcoming residents. If i could say one thing to new players: It’s ok if you feel like you’ve done everything you need to for the day and feel like you should put the game down. This game is all about patience which can sometimes be frustrating but also very rewarding. Some days, once you’ve done your daily tasks like gather materials and talking to the villagers, there’s not much else to do and you have to wait until the next day where more stuff will be available. This game is designed to be played over several months and years so don’t rush it and take your time, building your town and getting everything the way you want it. This game is absolutely visually stunning Running at a gorgeous 1080p 30fps. That 30fps might seem like a bit of a bummer, but rest assured it stays at 30fps and never dips and still looks very smooth. The best thing about this game is it’s charm. Talking to each character is such an enjoyable experience. Multi playing with friends is smooth with no lag and a good way to trade items. This game is very addicting and you’ll most likely find yourself spending hours into the night. Keep in mind that the game will keep posing new quests and challenges weeks down the line. But a lot of this game is customisation and making your town look the way you want. I love this game so much, and if you are in the slightest bit interested, give it a try. I didn’t think this sort of game was for me either, but that is because it’s not enjoyable to watch someone else play the game but having your own journey is where the charm lies."
MasterCheff4,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I actually just made a metacritic account just to review this game. This would be an almost perfect game if it wasn't for the one island per switch feature mixed with the first player to log in be in control of the entire game's progression for all players. This is an increasing issue if you actually have 8 players on the same switch.

Each of the 8 players should have the ability to create their own island and be the representative of that island, controlling all progression of that island. Additionally, players on the same switch should be able to buy houses on other players islands on the same switch. This would allow a player to have full control over one island and it's progression, and then also have up to 7 additional houses across 7 other islands on that switch console.

I enjoy playing on the shared island, but the locked island progression and missing out on that progression is killer to this game. The current system lets player 1 get the full game, with all other players only objective is to complete nook miles.

Worst part is there was not even a warning at the beginning of the game letting the players know that the first person to play gets full control. I think that is the most disappointing aspect of this situation."
totoro0192,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"The game is great! I love playing online with my friends and developing my town, so cute and gorgeous!"
Henlo,"Mar 25, 2020",4,Overall a really good game but it **** that you can't play the on same island on a secondary console. My primary reason for me to buy the game was to play on the same Island as my fiance at the same time instead of this bad couch co-op. Or atleast be able to play the game split screened. I'm dissapointed. :/
Torokun,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Nintendo has done a great job keeping the consistency of the franchise over span of decades.  You have games such as Mario and Zelda where the gameplay matured with new hardwares.  You also have games such as Pokemon and Smash Bros where the core gameplay has been kept consistent.  I would keep Animal Crossing under that latter category.

I have no complain about the gameplay aspect.  However, it is a great shame that Nintendo is keeping the multiplayer to be limited to one island per Switch.  If you are going to commit to account based system and let multiplay users to have their own account, you simply can not have this approach of locking different account holders under one environment.

How awesome would it have been if you as a different user starts your own game and a new island emerges and you get to have your own experience.  And you can go visit your family members' island?

It kinda baffles me why Nintendo did not go for this approach with superior hardware such as Switch."
JohnnyQuid,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"It’s just a great fun game. Perfect for your kids of any age, perfect for you (assuming your an adult), perfect for your parents. Don’t let the user reviews fool you AC is overall just like the classic one I played as a kid. The customization is great, and I love the island vibe. The one downside IMO is the fact only one player, the first to start the game, is the the only one who can progress the “campaign“ game. Everyone in my house wants to help, which was the case in the older games. A must buy game for the switch . In fact it’s a “must buy switch to play the game” type of game haha"
Tiffhrndz,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"I bought a Nintendo Switch specifically for this game and was sooo excited to get into it. But it turns out you can only have one save file and on top of that, only one character has full freedom in the progress of the island. And since me and sister split the money it took to buy the switch and the game, we were planning to both play. But, little did we know, we can’t both play individually. What a waste of money for restricted gameplay."
ATaylor06,"Mar 25, 2020",1,This game is meant to be a household game where multiple people can play on the same island/town without hindered progress and etc. The current state of the game makes the second person on the island unable to progress through the game as well as limitations on what you can place/do. This is the last thing any of us wanted and has ruined the experience for me. This is a HUGE issue that I have no idea why it even got through the testing phase. Change this Nintendo or else I won’t be purchasing DLC nor continue playing this game.
amcclard,"Mar 25, 2020",3,"In all honesty, the game is up to the usual par of nintendo quality, however, the local co op multiplayer might as well not exist. If you're looking to play with a partner, friend, family member, etc. don't expect more than simply running around behind them the whole time. It's confusing to me why they even put this option in, it's completely useless and ruins the experience."
Surg3on,"Mar 25, 2020",6,"Its a lovely single player game with great writing however the multiplayer aspect is just a mess. Absolute mess. It is poorly explained what you can and cant do as a non-primary resident or visitor and you cant do a lot!

So Single player only give it an 8."
Sarahlynn31,"Mar 25, 2020",2,"Everything about the game is awesome, except that you know get one island. If you share a switch only one player get to truly experience gameplay. The other person just runs around with minimal objective and less opportunities. If you are a solo player you will very much enjoy the game, otherwise- don’t spend the money."
foxcxnt,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Love the game. As someone who has been playing since Wild World, it’s a universal fact that you’ve never been able to have more than one town/island on any console. If you decided to buy the game as a new player AND didn’t do your research? That’s your bad. Animal Crossing has been the same each and every release in this aspect, and that’s your fault.
The updates of New Horizons compared to New Leaf is incredible. I love being able to see the leaves and flowers move with the wind, or the fact that we can decorate outside of our homes. It’s created a new found desire to play the game each day!"
ProfessorChase,"Mar 25, 2020",10,These negative reviews are insane! This is easily one of the greatest games released for the switch to date. Playable hours will easily match and exceed games like BOTW.
Otakingu,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"While attending high school I spent several hours in my town in Animal Crossing Wild World on the Nintendo DS Lite. Rather surprisingly I spent very few hours on Animal Crossing New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS. I’ve always felt very strongly about linear games so it was to my great surprise and delight that the new horizons of Animal Crossing is a much structured experience and with progression that feels very natural.

This new installment is an evolution and they have truly perfected an already polished formula. I have spent many hours on my island, and with countless hours more ahead of me. This is how a new installment in a franchise should be done - Development of an already established concept! 10/10"
SmokeIndigo,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Me and my GF Sharing one **** fact that only one player is a full Citizen ruin the whole experience!
ocommodityo,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"My partner and I purchased.  We realized today that the 2nd user really is just a visitor and can't progress anything.  I really don't understand this logic here.  As it stands one player really can't do anything in the game until the other has time to move things forward.

There are no separated save slots.  It does not matter if you have a unique nintendo login.  There is one island per switch and the first person to login is the only person that progresses/names the island.  It even limits how the 2nd player gets items.

So completely avoid this title unless you are the sole player on your switch.  This was a waste of a purchase.  As it stands for a family household, it is actually $300+ to have a working animal crossing title.  Well, plus having a separate online account as well, lol."
evildoomfoot,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"this game is a solid 8 or 9, the one island per console thing does ****, but so does **** review bombing so it gets a 10 from me to help offset the angry basement dwellers"
slayerzack1,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"I have been Playing New Horizons for a while now and it’s worth the wait. The game is relaxing, enjoyable, well thought out, and fantastic you can chill with your friends online. It’s fun for all ages. Right now, we really need a distraction from the chaos around us, and this game has come at the perfect time. So relax, hop on that plane, and enjoy your new life on the beach, in the woods, or even by the river. The choice is yours. Build your own house"
Northpole22,"Mar 25, 2020",3,I would agree with most reviews that having a very ... Messed up multiplayer system is bad and will move people away. However I would say if you love old animal crossing then your in luck and all that old goodness is here. However if your wanting something more substantial or have a narrative to keep you entertained intrigued why you're locked at home I'm sorry you're not going to find it. This game is more meant for doing very small monotonous things think of it almost like **** valley and if you're not really into games like that then it doesn't get much better and it is slowly starting to bore me to tears and I can't see any reason keep playing after 5 days I'm sorry
Evil_Pasta,"Mar 25, 2020",4,"Truly a great game.

With a terrible local multiplayer system... For a console like a Switch...

Well, not exactly The ""Multiplayer""...
Look
You have an island. One per console. For all five possible accounts.

Just one island. This means that daily resources (from rocks and trees, and some plants) are limited either for just one player or split between all players.

But that's not everything. The only person that can actually progress the whole island further is the first player, the one that created the island. Other players depend on him. (Imagine having no idea about that, and letting a 6-year-old kid play it first) (Not my problem, thankfully)

Not only progress, even managing the island is the privilege of the primary player.

Alright. So if this game is designed this way, maybe players are supposed to play together?-
-Hah, of course not! First of all - no split-screen. Second of all, everything depends on the group leader. Secondary players can only run around him, do some stuff, but their inventory is non-existent until they get the leadership (meanwhile everything they got as secondary players gets stuck in a limited-size box owned by the player who was a group leader)

...
Have I told you the story of how I ruined the first impression for my older brother, who technically was the first player, but I was the first to actually play the game once the island was created, and I was the one to collect all the available resources...

//Yeah, I was wondering, why couldn't I progress any further for the last couple of days. So I made quick research... Turns out that's why our experience was so much worse than it should have been//

...Game is good, I agree on that part. But there is one problem. Because I and my brother share one Switch, neither I nor he can enjoy it entirely. And after some time we will get to a point, where I'm not getting all of the content the game has just because I am a secondary player."
Rovarknjim,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"The game handles progressing so well. I absolutely love it, the only thing I'd change is having more than one person on multiplayer per switch. Besides that i love how cute it is, making new friends and playing it with my family."
DRod,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Second player limitations is ridiculous. Shared island should have shared responsibilities. Second player has no motivation in the game because you are hindered based on player 1s progress. You cant contribute to projects, receive extra nook miles for completing task, or receive cool DIYs because only player 1 receives them."
Ison,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Alls i want is my own island it makes no sense to lock it to 1 island per console fix it
aaronsxc,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This is my first full Animal Crossing game, having watched friends play since the first, and dabbling a tiny bit myself. I've been having the best time tending to my island and its residents. I like being able to play at my own pace, not feeling rushed to objectives, and just getting to relax. That being said, I have also had a very difficult time even putting the game down. Even if you have never played an Animal Crossing game before, I HIGHLY recommend checking this one out."
Pinsol,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"If you have more than one person in your house that wants to play this game, don't bother. You are not only locked to one island per game console, but player 2 is progression locked behind player 1 and cannot do any story activities at all, and they also can't get any tools unless player one has them already. They also can't get any tools the first player didn't already get.

Essentially, if you are player two you can't even really play the game. There is absolutely no reason for it to work this way, as evidenced by the ability to have multiple profiles in the latest pokemon games."
Lassius,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Folks seem to think that a mild inconvenience is worth giving a game a rating of 0. If the game does not run, or damages your hardware, or if it is literally unplayable, then that deserves a 0. It's a gorgeous game that makes me happy, it's probably one of the strongest titles in the series. Folks giving this game a 0 are one of the reasons we can't have nice things"
Crisantemo,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This game is really well made and deserve to be played, I love every detail but I wish you could do something more in the online multiplayer"
andrea3,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"The kids and I were excited to get this after watching the trailer, since we are stuck at home.  They play a lot of minecraft and like to play in each other's worlds.  I was ok with sharing an island, sharing resources, and working together.  It could have been fun to play as a team.  Now that we're playing though the game is miserable for players 2-4.  My son can't unlock an axe so he had to get his sister, who happened to get lucky and be the first player, to make him one.  The only work around is having the rest of us play multiplayer using her character, but she is still the only one who can complete any of the tasks and advance the game.  It's boring and frustrating for the other players.  I would return it but they are invested in the island now, but it's creating a lot of conflict.  Do not recommend for families.  I'm not buying another Switch for me to casually take part in one game.  My pre teen daughter who is player one doesn't even play video games that much anymore. It's pretty ridiculous that Nintendo thinks we will all just buy another system or two for one game.  It should not have been marketed as multiplayer and I feel like the advertising video was completely misleading."
cghaman,"Mar 25, 2020",2,"I preordered this for my girlfriend—along with waiting in line just to get the limited edition console—and was excited to share a game that I had unexpectedly fallen in love with back on the Gamecube.  Boy, have things taken a turn for the worse.  Only one island per CONSOLE?  That, combined with playing the same awful 3 minute guitar strumming on an endless loop (a bug that Nintendo has not even acknowledged, let alone fixed)...those in isolation would have dropped this from a 10 to a 5.  What drops this all the way to a 2 is the fact that I cannot do anything at ALL to advance the game when she isn't playing.  Okay, so I can add to the **** I couldn't get the museum to exist, and I cannot get anything else to happen.  I am beyond peeved, and Nintendo's silence in response to criticism is deafening.  I am furious about this, and would return this game IMMEDIATELY were it not a gift.  What on Earth happened to Nintendo?  I will NEVER buy another game or game system from Nintendo until they fix what they screwed up."
Packetochips,"Mar 25, 2020",2,"Player one being the only player that can actually access the entire game, in its full is one of the worse gaming mechanics I've ever come across. The fact that the game doesn't even allude to this is what makes it even **** even more. Instant 0 from me for this as it completely ruins the experience for any other player other than the ""Island representative"". cheap, greedy move. Don't even get me started on the pathetic attempt at ""local multiplayer"". classic Nintendo"
Eckman6121,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"As someone who is brand new to the series I have certainly enjoyed it thus far. I've got my first house upgrade. I really enjoy the relaxing nature of the game. We have two switches in our house, so we won't be sharing the game. But given the size of the map, I don't really see that as much of a problem. It's not a perfect game, but it's a good game with a minimum of problems. The load times really haven't been as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be and I am playing it as a digital download as opposed to a cartridge. I enjoy the crafting in the game and it can be slow paced at times, most of the time. I can make a ton of money doing whatever I want. I like fishing, so the majority of my money has been from that. Even the crappy tools last a fair bit of time. It does what Animal Crossing games set out to do, to be relaxing and fun. I would love to share my island with other users on my switch, it would be a combined effort, expanding a community of friends and family. Something other reviewers aren't considering. This is a great and does what it set out to do. 8/10."
Lovelyrics,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"My whole family was very excited for this game. We were willing to accept the whole one island game even though it ****. My problem is that only the Creator of the island gets the whole game. Since my husband made the island he's getting all these cool quests! Build and furnish 3 houses, place a bridge, a store etc. Everyone else can just collect things. That's it. Collect and build a house. I'm an adult, not a 3 year old. So a game with no goals is bumming me out. At this point I would rather have an island of my own."
Lifthrasil,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"This game is not a good and fun experience for anybody who shares their switch. The person who creates the island is the only one allowed to do anything and they're having a good time. As anybody after the island creator, you're just allowed to pay off your loans."
Yob_i,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"They absolutely blew my expectations out of this world, I could have not asked for a more perfect game. There are plenty of things to look forward too as well and am highly anticipating the many years I'm going to put into this beauty."
SamuelPepys,"Mar 25, 2020",0,SCAM! Only one person can REALLY play per game. Second users have only limited access to the game. You basically need to buy two Nintendo switches and two copies of the game to play the game for two people - disgusting.
D4C11T,"Mar 25, 2020",10,I loved the game the truth the best of saga the ones that put the bad rating are the same burns sony
KageKuni,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"I recommend for anyone seriously on the fence about buying this game to watch the directs. Spoil yourself. There is no story to Animal Crossing, no two playthroughs are alike, there is nothing to spoil. Research and make an informed decision. I share my switch  with two other adults, they work, I don’t. Couch Co-op works fine. People are upset that Followers can’t talk to villagers and doesn’t have an inventory while in Co-op mode. You can still access the tools you already had and anything you pick up enters the box in town hall. Everything people are complaining about was stated in the Animal Crossing Direct and in other information outlets before preorders were made available, and with that knowledge the complaints seem pretty unwarranted. The game itself is very cute, very Animal Crossing, and very easy to pick up for new players. customization is more extensive than in any previous AC game, allowing for more unique experiences in the game. Online multiplayer is also super easy compared to New Leaf and I find my island has become a hangout hub for all the friends who’ve visited. For fellow Time Lords, There is also notably no and I repeat NO consequence for Time Traveling, assuming you stop at every day on your journey, talk to every villager once per in-game day, Sell your turnips within the week you bought them in, and collect your bonus Nook Miles at the start of every day. I feel like a lot of NPCs who seemed a little bland in New Leaf have been revitalized in this entry (Blathers especially.) Many NPCs from past games are not present however; those who enjoyed City Folk’s Cafe and were hoping for a return will be disappointed.

Overall I can’t get enough of this game. There are some choices I question, not bundling a certain Cutting Board recipe with the Ironwood Kitchenette, specifically, but it’s a fun game nonetheless, and I recommend it to returning fans from previous AC games, or to people who don’t even play games usually."
Vexla,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Great game very fun and relaxing. I enjoy visiting my friends towns and exchanging native fruits and crafting them recipes! So much to do and I could pour hours into this game. I cant wait to explore the other seasons and play the events that are to come! Grade A animal crossing game
smurfeater,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Seriously? My wife started the game and I came on as second player. I can't do squat to push the game forward and must wait for her to play to do anything. Absolute failure on Nintendo's part. Complete bs I can't get my money back...
Cmicale,"Mar 25, 2020",0,My boyfriend bought this game for us to play together but since there's only one island per console we ended up competing for resources/accomplishments until he gave up because he wanted me to have fun playing it rather than him.
CheatNasty,"Mar 25, 2020",0,If more than one person wants to play this game on the same switch you are out of luck. The game limits you to one island per switch and if you are not the first person to join then you are a side character who cant make any decisions or progress the game in any way.
Huccy,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Il gioco è stupendo, non capisco perchè la gente si debba sempre lamentare! Un 6,3 di media io non lo posso accettare. Vi meritate solo FIFA 20/21/22/23 Etc. Comprare un gioco per poi lamentarsi è da ipocriti."

Buris,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"A decent addition to the franchise marred by unfortunate and needless limitations in order to sell more Switch consoles. This will backfire on Nintendo, probably cost nintendo more money in the long run as will the mediocre pokemon games.

I cannot see Nintendo continuing to sell mediocre or flawed products moving forward, especially when better options exist. (TamTam, **** Valley)"

KnightowlSC,"Mar 25, 2020",3,The limitation of 1 island per console makes this a cash grab that EA would be proud of and ruins a perfectly great experience.  Nintendo needs to fix this!
sonylost22513,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"It's a lovely game that honors the series and improves on many things, but it is completely crippled by dishonest marketing of its multiplayer and local co-op. Only the first player to start the game will have a full experience of Animal Crossing. Any other players will live in a perpetually unfulfilling world. Tasks, villagers, tools, experience, etc will never be fully attainable as a second player. With a simple software update, this game could go from a broken co-op experience to being a beautiful, shared adventure in paradise. Please fix this Nintendo."
dorisweatshirt,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Even if you buy two seperate copies and such, you can only have one island PER SWITCH. ruined the experience up to the point that i’m not gonna bother playing. Yeah its typical for AC but it’s 2020, not 2012."
P4nikbu20n,"Mar 25, 2020",0,It's bogus. I can't have my own island and visit others on the console? I would get my credit back if I didn't buy a digital copy. Honestly won't play it now.
C3PSL0CK,"Mar 25, 2020",0,You are forced to buy the game 2 times if u share the switch with others. your progress is capped by the player who start the game first.
mwnobles,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"An amazing installment for the Animal Crossing Series. The game design and detail is amazing, the ability to edit so much of the island is great. They've added a lot of features, but they've taken some away. I've been playing since Gamecube, and it meets the AC formula and expands on it.

These reviews I see about it needing to be more open world, in my opinion, would be against the Animal Crossing feel and design. It's not an RPG, it's a sim where you interact with the villagers and relax.

The other reviews about people complaining how Nintendo is like EA are completely unjustified. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember on Gamecube if you wanted your own town, you had to get another memory card.  City Folk for the Wii was one town per Wii. I believe Wild World and New Leaf you may have had to just buy the game again, not sure about that one. However, it's always been pretty based around sharing a town if you share a console. I also don't have to pay to win. Nor is it a trash game with a amazing title slapped on it to make a grab for money(Battlefront).

Objectives are just kind of there if you want to do them, they're handed to you as you play. Reviews are saying objectives aren't clear, but what's not clear about just living life on a island? There isn't really suppose to be a point to the game, you just get creative.

I would wish that they would bring the art exhibit back to the museum, as well as the swimming mechanic from New Leaf. Other than that, amazing game. Brings back a lot of the same ideas from the Gamecube. Long Live Wisp!"
KillerUnleashed,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Ended up returning the game purely based off the fact that it locks all other users on the Switch out of progressing the game. We will repurchase it when this is changed but it is complete brainless game design. Also siting other games in the series as being the same is flawed because the original AC game on GameCube you could have separate towns per memory card.
Nibbles123,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"I have been a massive fan of the Animal Crossing franchise for a while. Love the whole updated feel the game gets on the Switch, so many little details left out of earlier games look soo much better on this console. Having fun with friends trying to get all the different fruits so I can grow my little fruit empire, and a great way to pass the time while stuck indoors.

The crafting can be a little grinding at times, but when you have nothing else planned for the day, then I shall chop wood and hit stones to my heart's content."
cedarlj,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"$60 is a lot of money to spend for only one person to be able to have a well-rounded experience on a video game. I have two sisters who also were excited to play the game, but despite them BOTH having their own Nintendo accounts and online accounts too, they were booted up onto my island with not much to do. I considered even buying them their own copies of the game, but upon further investigation that isn’t enough to allow them to play their own game. So if we all wanted to have our own islands, we would each need to buy our own Switch and copies of the game. This is so ridiculous, it seriously ruined the experience of the game for me (and obviously my sisters too). Not about to drop $600+ just for us to play a game together, I can’t believe Nintendo set it up like this. Isn’t it enough to have bought one system (already $300, a decent chunk of money), each of us to be paying for our own Online subscriptions, and to have gotten the $60 game disc? They need to fix this ASAP.
I do like the game, but like I said, it’s hard to enjoy when I live with two other people who also wanted to be able to play."
Jeffward9,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Great game! So much fun and so much to do. They really stream lined a lot of stuff to make it quicker and easier which I really appreciate.
Sscully,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I cannot grasp why the second player literally cannot have any fun on this game rather than be an at best ""shadow"" to the resident leader or a resource collector. It completely takes away from the experience. I bought this game for my girlfriend who is not an avid gamer, but loves the animal crossing titles. I can understand the appeal of the game and I would love to play it, but i am basically being forced to wait for her to play, which is not nearly as often as I would like to play. PLEASE fix this issue of being player 2 it takes away from the game entirely. Literally, not enjoyably if you are player 2."

Shachousama,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I created an account just to leave this review because of how stupid this game is.  What kind of idiot thought that only one user per console should be able to play or enjoy most aspects of the game?!?!  A second user not only cannot progress the game, does not get access to many of the recipes the first user does, and cannot make any significant impact on the island.  Why doesn't everyone get their own island?!?!?!?!?!  No one wants to get their own console just to enjoy a game.  This decision was asinine.  If there's a way to refund a digital download I would love to do so.  Can't believe I paid $60 for this."
SirPirawin,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Not the greatest game on the switch, but definitely a great game nonetheless.

This game retains the relaxed and addictive atmosphere the series is known for while also offering many quality of life improvements, such as choosing where other villagers live and the ability to place furniture outside.

Many people are having issue that multiple users on the same switch can only play on the same island, however this has been a staple of the series since the beginning. Don't believe the review bombers, this game is worth your money. Being able to play on the same island can be a fun experience. You and your other islanders can work together to make a little piece of paradise. It is true that only the first character made can go though the starting tutorial, but this is honestly a great choice as it can be slow and put many people new to the series off."
GreedyNintendo,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"It's a good game dont get me wrong. However,  the inability to have separate islands per console is an outdated model. Especially when the hardware can clearly support it. Would give it  higher rating if only nintendo had its neighborhood good guy feel. But I guess they  have the mentality  of every other game dev and want us to  shell out hundreds like we are a bunch of idiots. Had respect for nintendo but know ive lost it. Crazy part is this will keep happening and I'll watch one of my favorite companies become a ubisoft or ea"

I was also impressed that my sister and her boyfriend could play together too. They share their island but its fun they can play at the same time. The connection is amazing. It feels like a new game but it also feels like the game I've known and loved.

greekstallion,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Absolutely ridiculous that two players can't have their own individual islands on a current gen system. There is absolutely zero reason that such a limitation should exist beyond greed. Nintendo support actually told me to ""buy a second system."" Are you kidding me? Buy a second video game console if I want to be able to fully experience a game just like my fiance on our switch? Is Nintendo out of their minds?

So be prepared, my fiance is the ""island representative"" or whatever because she played first. She gets to progress the game, she gets to name the island, she gets to build stuff. I just get to follow and wander around like an advanced NPC. Oh, and island resources spawn ridiculously slowly, so if she plays before me on what's her island that I'm pretty much a guest on, I'm just SoL unless she leaves some for me. I don't even feel like there is a point in me playing this

I'm sure she would say it's a 10/10 experience, but it's a 0/10 for me because I get some halfbaked version for my money and can't experience the full version with my own profile on the console and my own save files.

I was so excited for this. I bought my switch for this a few months ago. What an embarrassment for Nintendo to pull this."

markkbara122,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Probably the best animal crossing game to date. Great for all-time players and new ones alike. The wait for the game was worth it, as it shows a leap from previous entries. It has good online play and charming characters. New options to explore and find things. It helps to relax, pass the time and interact. A great game overall. If you are scared by the mixed user reviews, just note, all of the negative ones complain on the lack of being able to have two islands in the same switch. I don't have this problem myself, but if you have no interest in having multiple islands do not hesitate on getting this game."
writeforurlife,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"I'm so happy to be returning to the world of Animal Crossing. All our old friends from previous games appear to be on the island with us, along with some new characters. The online multiplayer functionality is better than it's ever been, and I like the addition of a crafting system. Of course, with new technology, New Horizons is the most beautifully rendered game in the Animal Crossing series so far. I'm especially impressed with the lighting and the ""fuzzy"" detail on many of the animal neighbors. New Horizons also introduces a new character creation mechanic. No more frantically searching for the ""right"" answers to questions from Bob or K.K. Slider to create a character that looks how you want - now you can just choose from a wider variety of skin tones, eye shapes, and hair styles and colors.

Of course it's disappointing that there can't be multiple ""islands"" on the same device or game card. However, this isn't new: only one player per game card could be the ""mayor"" of the town in New Leaf, leaving the other player unable to make changes to the town. Other than wishing more than one person could have an island on the same save file, New Horizons is everything I wanted from a new Animal Crossing game and more."
aerthax,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I'm really disappointed by this Nintendo game. The fact that you can only play on one island on one console even if you log in through different accounts and only the Player Nr.1 can actually make progress in the game is very frustrating. I will return the game because Nintendo unveils prehistoric strategies to force the people to buy more nintendo switch consoles. For bigger families and couples it's even more horrible.
Sorry, Nintendo.
Very bad Move"
BlazedIon,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn’t cool. In fact, only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from Tom Nook and other characters.

ZinniaWish,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Es hermoso y lleno de vida , con un montón de cosas que hacer y sin fin simpre hay algo que  lograr, los detalles se cuidaron muy bien y la experiencia de convivi con tu familia y amigos desde una misma consola es lo que fomenta a planar las cosas que se pueden lograr.

Desde la E3 se nos confirma una isla por consola y eso no fue novedad para mi por que es algo normal en la saga compartir el pueblo con otros 3 avatares o personas, pero el que puedas jugar al mismo tiempo con otra personan ayuda a facilitar ciertas tareas y hacen el día más difrutables .

La gente que lo tiene bien en claro sabía que si quería ser individualista o compartir su isla con sus seres cercanos,  muchos tomaron la precaución de compar una consola antes o se esperaron a la edición especial y eso esta bien para unos y mal para otros, pero no es novedad tener que comprar otro consola para poder jugar otros títulos multijugador con otra persona cercana a ti, como el caso de mosnter hunter, splatoon,  o pokemon por que no se pueden jugar de dos al mismo tiempo y mucho menos compartir la partida. Para mi este juego es perfecto y muy disfrutable , el ver hasta donde llega la gente con sus islas será cosa del la imaginación que tenga cada quien."
Mattee,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Really, an amazing game! This is my first Animal Crossing game and I am enjoying it so much! The one island per console thing is a bit of a bummer but I guess that's just how Animal Crossing always has been. Loving the cute and colorful graphics! The sound design is great, as well. It feels like you are really on a deserted island getaway. Overall, great game! Must-buy!"
Lost4parts,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Only one island per switch. Even if you have another copy of the game. The saved file remains on the switch. I can appreciate developers incorporating new ideas to get people to play together, but such things shouldnt be forced upon the player."
ClayT,"Mar 25, 2020",2,"Created an account just to add my voice to the crowd. I bought the game for my fiancé and I to play together. Of the two of us, I am the one who is much more likely to play. I let her play the game first so that she could name the island and choose where she wanted her house. Little did I know that she would become the primary player, essentially locking me out of progressing the island on my own at all. What is the point in separating what each player has the capability of doing? She mostly enjoys fishing and catching butterflies, and isn’t interested at all in grinding material. None the less, it’s up to her to progress the game, building items for new homes, opening the museum, etc. On top of that, she’s given recipes that I don’t get to make these things for the home. The secondary account is just at pure disadvantage. I knew coming into the game that we had to share an island, which I had no issue with. What I didn’t realize was that I had to deal with a caste system and have my villager live like a second hand citizen. There was no warning that the secondary account was going to have limited influence on the island. There is no way to switch who is in what position, either. Nintendo really needs to fix this issue. I would be having a thoroughly enjoyable time if it wasn’t for this awful system."
4Plants,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Finally an animal Crossing where we can put our leave down outside of our house and it can actually be the object. Even though animal crossing in the past was played for years in our house--including my elderly mother who played happily played 'A New Leaf' from the day it came out until now;  Our hopes finally came true with New Horizons. I like that when we go into our house we can turn the toggle switch so we have a 360° view of each room. I wish we could do that on the outside of the house as well.

Shelly34,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"The new Animal Crossing is really successful and it is great fun to play this game.
There are many innovations and the gameplay has been made very motivating.

Now comes the big BUT:
You can only build one island per console and per game. That means the second player has the A .... card. We are currently playing the game in party mode on the couch together and we are just EXTREMELY disappointed with Nintendo.
How can you develop a game today that has such a bad couch co-op mode and then ask a family that everyone should buy a console and a game if you want to build your own island and not all the time like want to run one annoying tag after the other.
A split screen, for example, would have been a great idea for the couch co-op, where the second player can go wherever he wants and do whatever he wants, that should be possible without any problems in 2020.

I actually would have liked to give the game 5 stars, but I'm just disappointed with Nintendo, it's not that difficult to provide a separate island for each player on a console.

Unfortunately, all other players lose the fun of the game !!!!"
ReaperAvarynii,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Effort was definitely made on this game. I can tell that there are different types of things to do in game. However I almost guarantee that I will never get there. For now, I really like the game. For now. Multiplayer is awful, I bought it so my wife and I could enjoy something fun and it turns out that second player is just one person as the leader and the other follows them around pretty much unable to do anything but pick stuff up. Pointless and not worth setting up in the first place. As far as online goes I won't even bother trying it. Having 8 people able to draw off of my already dismal material sources at anytime just isn't feasible. Iron nuggets are hyper rare at best. I get one on average for every two days I play. I think the idea behind this is to encourage online play.

At first I was super excited, this is a new and unique concept to me. I don't predict I am going to care enough about it to play more than a week or so. I have a situation in which I need a tiny number of iron nuggets and at the pace I'm going I'll have flat gotten tired of trying. You can spend certain currency to go to vacant islands and take supplies, but you will only get so much of that currency so if you don't think before you spend you will find yourself in short supply and only able to get a bit every day.

The whole game appears to be geared towards tiny amounts of play time. At an hour every day I have ran all but the most common resources out. Even weeds no longer spawn on the parts of the island I can reach. If I have two inventories of high value items to sell, the second inventory (And so on) always seems to sell for substantially less which means it becomes annoying trying to grind for money.

Tools that last require resources that I can't afford to spare if I want to progress the game, so I am currently unable to craft them. This was a terrible oversight at best. I've resorted to making cheap tools over and over again and have ultimately found they are more cost efficient in the long run.

I can't recommend this game. I will continue to hang in there and update my review for as long as I can hold my attention on the game but again I doubt I'll even still keep it downloaded on my switch past a week or two.

Don't buy it."
Dippylass,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"As much as I love the feel of the game (being new to the Animal Crossing games in general), I can't rate this game higher than 0 due to the terrible decisions around multiplayer households playing together.

I bought this game primarily for myself, whilst my boyfriend could play less when he wanted. Unfortunately due to timings he played first. Little did I know this sealed the deal for me poor game experience. The first player has access to The main story line and decision making roles. Any extra player is a glorified NPC who contributes nothing!!! As i payed for the game i expect to be able to get the same game experience, it is shocking decision by jintendo to limit people in this way and try and fve thmee to buy another switch. BEWARE IF YOU HAVE KIDS AS IT IS BOUND TO CAUSE ARGUMENTS."
SimpleSimonSays,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Bought this for myself and my wife to play, but in Nintendo's infinite wisdom they have decided that only one of us will ever get to enjoy the full experience, locking out anyone but the first player from making critical game decisions.

jacobbatey,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"this game is absolutely fantastic, the crafting system and freedom of layout design really helps differentiate this game from the previous instalments in the franchise, while still feeling like the traditional animal crossing games.

Fakit,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Was going to give it a 9 mainly due to the equipment durability issue however, I changed it to a 10 to try and balance out the unnecessary zeroes it is receiving. Yeah I can see how people are upset that they cannot have more than one island due to having multiple families but the review should be based on how the game looks and plays. On that note the game plays great, better experience and creativity than ever before. HD graphics suit well for the game, and adding in simple features such as being able to place outdoor objects or river hopping makes the experience much more enjoyable. As stated before my only issue is that the equipment breaks and I really do not want to have to carry around more than one shovel, fishing rod, etc. Overall great game, highly recommend."

There is really thin gap between the peaceful and the boring. I think this game is the latter. After playing the game for three days, I felt this is kind of ""take-out fast food version of peace .""

With this move they basically gave a middle finger to all of us and told us that they only care about making money. I always thought they were one of the good ones, but after this I'm reconsidering that position. Shame on you Nintendo!"

Jakobrockon,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Stunning. Stress relieving. Unbelievably charming and joyful. The ability to curate your island and enjoy the slow passing of time rather than the constant pressure to build, buy, and discover things on an objective storyline other games work with is exceptionally refreshing. Not to mention, the game is CUTE. The puns, the blathering of animal creatures in place of speech, the adorable poses your character makes when changing outfits.

It is the nonlinear game all can enjoy, if you only look past it's simple setup. If you want complexity, seek elsewhere. This is purely for the young at heart and those than want to escape reality with their friends, or on their own."

Jimo,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"While yes, being limited to one island per switch is pretty stupid, it is certainly not enough to make it a 0/10 game. New horizons is the best game in the series in my opinion. Its looks gorgeous, it's fun and interactive, so relaxing and very polished. If you just want a layer back and chill experience, I highly recommend this game."
Blackrose1691,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Hours of fun so far. I love the game and cannot wait for more time to pass. Right now I am just watching my flowers crossbreed for the rare one!
IreAlt05,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Un juego excelente, con detalles muy cuidados. Su mundo es muy intensivo y se han mejorado los fallos de su anterior entrega. El mejor Animal crossing de la saga."
sicariana,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Animal Crossing: New Horizons only allows one save file per switch; anyone who shares a switch will not be able to play the game. Very disappointing. Text and cutscenes also need to be skippable.
MrFrijolero,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Games implemented new features and great ways to prevent other from cheating and ruining the in game trade currency. Honestly a huge step up from New Leaf. It’s what City Folk should have been. The long wait was worth it and they’ve kept their fans happy. Don’t listen to the other reviews, it’s just Sony fans complaining because they don’t own a switch and don’t have anything even close to this for their console."
Hahn,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Que gran juego, llevo horas de vicio. es muy bueno se puede hacer de todo. nada mejor para pasar la pandemia"
steevee,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"This game is undeniably adorable and super fun, unless, like me, you are the second player on the same switch system. Then the game locks you out of all consequential decisions and you have to wait for player one to progress as a passive resident on the same island.  The only way to get the full experience is to but another switch system. This is absolutely not acceptable and has destroyed and fun I was having in the game."
Wack88,"Mar 25, 2020",1,you already know why Im upset it’s a good game but Nintendo needs to add what we’ve been asking for.
TheAFKLegend,"Mar 25, 2020",0,11 days after release.  Still cannot play the game because all Switches are sold out everywhere.  This one island per console joke has cost me $60 and my switch.  Good luck.
magnussh,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This game is just awesome! Everything about the game is so polished, cute and well-made! I just know this is a game I will be spending the majority of my quarantine time on as well as many more hours after! My favorite game on switch and the best game in the Animal Crossing series so far!"
DasEker,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"It is ridiculous that Nintendo does not allow each user to have a separate island. Not even buying a second cartridge works, you have to buy a second switch system for another island and that is just bs. This is even worse than EA!"
SenpaiJake,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing has been a series beloved by many, and for good reason. It is a feel-good, calm and open-ended game that allows the user to live a second day-to-day life among the animals of the world. Animal Crossing: New Horizons stays true to that formula - in some cases - while also breathing a much needed plume of fresh air into the series.

New Horizons drops the player into a deserted island setting with two other random villagers. You are here by order of Tom Nook and his apprentices Timmy & Tommy, who have set a vacation package for you. You start off the game in a cycle of material grinding and crafting, almost as if you just started a new Minecraft world. The newest functionality in the series to date here is the crafting and use of raw materials. You will build tools (a lot), harvest raw materials from rocks and trees, and continue crafting each day to make new furniture, fulfill any requests Tom Nook lays out for you, and to even build some homes.

While there are no true end-goals or end game, Animal Crossing has never been about that. The game does give a player a general direction, in which you and Nook will build the island into a bustling little community, where you have complete control on housing location, bridges, inclines, and even the terrain! The creativity mixed with the endless amount of items there seems to be leaves for many to dump hours daily into a series you would typically only play for an hour or so every so often. This in addition to the Nook Miles, a set of finite and smaller infinite goals, allows for an addictive and repetitive game play experience. House decorating has received a major overhaul with the new drag and drop editor (a godsend!). The developer definitely focused a lot on small details too, with the gorgeous graphics depicting realistic rain, wind rustling the trees and weeds, detailed bugs and fish, and even the ability to eat fruit for a reason!

While New Horizons expands in many ways, there are some choices that have left the game feeling a little bit lonely, and others confused. Things such as Gyroids and the Cafe, or other staples of the series are completely missing. The Happy Home Academy no longer has a cool online showcase of player homes, and has gone back to simply sending you random gifts each week. A lot of the Nintendo-themed game items seemed to have disappeared, and the ones available have become extremely harder to obtain and there are few of them. One of the saddest changes to me so far seems to be with your villagers. There are so many to possibly have move in, but unlike older games where villager interaction was a major part of what you do, it feels very stripped down in New Horizons. Villagers, more often than not, repeat the same dialogues each day, and usually don't have much to say in general. It's rare to get one caught on a tangent, or ask you random questions, or request your help finding an item. In New Leaf you could even play games like Hide and Seek with them, but in New Horizons it seems they'd rather stay home or stretch in the town plaza and say a couple blips to you and that's it.

Lastly, multiplayer and the handling of saves naturally come into the discussion. A lot of people have shared concern over the fact one system has one island, and while it might be shocking to new players, this isn't the only Animal Crossing to function this way. One system usually holds one world for multiple players to play on. While they have locked progression to the first user; a bad call in many ways, the overall state of it is typical here but I can see why it would obstruct the fun for many families or couples who only have one switch. General multiplayer, especially online and local wireless, is basic and for that its fun. You can set best friends, and you can all visit each other's islands to talk to locals, hang out, and acquire materials. No qualms there.

Lastly, we have to look at the save backups. There currently exist no way to do so, but they have stated they're working on a system to cater to those that need it.

New Horizons is an amazingly fun and addictive title with beautiful graphics, cheery and calming music, and endless creative possibilities. While it's a great AC game, many series fans will be bummed about the loss of many series mainstays and might find it lacking for that matter, but it has become widely accessible for that reason, and I can safely say it is a wonderful game and I can't recommend it enough for its gameplay and aesthetic alone."
Mintypaws,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"It’s really cute and fun. It makes me smile and if you want some fun to pass the time pick it up
People are review bombing it because they don’t like one island per switch.
But that doesn’t affect me and is a perfect game for me.
If your lonely and want some friends pick up this game"
OneWheel,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"I loved this game as I started it up. It was so beautiful and seemed to be everything I wanted in an animal crossing game...

Then the grind started. You need iron to unlock the recipes to explore your whole island. But you can't easily get enough iron to do that unless you can reach the rocks on the inaccessible parts of the island. So you harvest what little you can each day before being forced to wait till the next day to harvest more. And all the while, your tools are breaking, which costs iron to replace, slowing your progress.

When you finally DO unlock the ladder to explore the whole island, you're tasked with wasting much, much more of your precious resources building stupid crap for NPC neighbors.

This game has a lot going for it. BUT so, so much of the great content is locked behind arbitrary, frustrating, grindy nonsense. When you are the only character in the game capable of any decision making, crafting, or planning of any sort, it gets tedious fast. It wouldn't be so bad if you could *purchase* some of the resources you need, but you can't. You have to build the tools to harvest them. You have to harvest them. You have to build the furniture with them. You have to choose where the furniture goes. You have to do everything yourself if you want to unlock everything the game has to offer.

Nintendo promised us an Animal Crossing game where we *could* completely customize every square inch of the island.

Sadly, what they delivered is an Animal Crossing game where you are *forced* to customize every square inch of the island.

This issue combined with the irredeemably stupid choices surrounding cloud saves and multiplayer make this one of the most disappointing games I've ever paid full price for. 5/10

5/10"
alyssaemily,"Mar 25, 2020",0,cant even have my own island as another member of my household has already started playing! ridiculous! we don’t have the money to buy a new nintendo switch! fix your game!!!
ganjaAPE,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Could have been the best Animal Crossing game to date but nope, Nintendo has to ruin it by only allowing one island per game. Girlfriend loves the game, I absolutely hate it now."
Binarissimo,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"It is abused !  A single island per console means practically only one user while there were 4 of us including my 3 kids wanting to play it on our different profiles, I’m disgusted by this Game and Nintendo."
Xvrignis,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This is the best AC, the graphics looks so nice and the gameplay is enjoyful. I have spent about 50 hours since last friday and I cant stop playing it. The game is BEAUTIFUL."
heintzer,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Great game and the issue people have with multiplayer is ridiculous. There are so many reasons why that is the case to share an island. Also it's not that big of a deal to share. The whole point of the game is to have fun and people are taking it too seriously. Enjoy it for what it is, a game and don't get hung up on the fact that you need to actually play it to get the resources you want"
xSaur,"Mar 25, 2020",2,"I started playing BEFORE my boyfriend. And in the end, after he went into the game, he just had NOTHING left to do there, because  I had already collected all the loot and everything that was on the island. The limitation of one island per Switch is so annoying, why we need co-op mode at all, when only one player gets everything? Sad that Nintendo don't care about fans, only about selling overpriced games with low fps. Jeezuz, Nintendo really has became worse than EA."
Fnaf12344,"Mar 25, 2020",7,Das Spiel ist sehr gut. Für mich und meine Schwestern ist es ein riesen Spaß und jeden Tag gibt es was neues zu machen. Auch dass System mit dem das man nicht   alles sofort bekommt ist sehr gut gelungen. DA man sich jetzt mehr Zeit fürs spielen nehmen muss um voran zu kommen. Ein sehr  guter Nachfolger
ACNHSUCKS,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Dont play if you want to have your own island as opposed to sharing an island with someone with the same console. Unbelievably stupid business decision. Unless people are stupid enough to buy another console. Wish I could return it but im the idiot who bought it digitally thru eshop
DubzCheckEm,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"Pretty unbelievable how the multiplayer turned out to be. The game itself is pretty enjoyable, but for a family trying to share the game... I just don't see how not allowing each player to enjoy the same features is justifiable. Hopefully they make some kind of patch to address this, but I doubt it. If you play solo, go for it."
jd4242,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"This entry into the franchise is clearly the best animal crossing experience to date. However, due to the role of Resident Representative the shared island design is robbed of cooperation and a sense of community essential to the game. A lack of option for multiple islands offers no work-around for this issue, making the game almost unplayable for the many families with multiple equal users on one Switch. Please fix these monumental issues., Nintendo."
Yugare-Chan,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"I really enjoy the game so far.

My  coups de Coeur's are;
•The detailed graphics on the critters you catch and the villagers. (you can see ****)
• crafting and customizing mechanic • STORAGE • Flowers grow back
• The museum. It's in every game but check it out room per room. Wow. I also have some things I don't necessarily like. Like how you can not access information on the critters you have already caught. You have to catch it again and ask Blathers about it. It gets a little annoying with bugs. I'm hoping I'm just not far enough in game and there's going to be an encyclopedia app on the nook phone.

Also  sometimes I get caught on a barrier around houses and trees and it looks like I'm stuck moonwalking for some reason. A lot of people don't like that you can only have one islands per switch but I don't personally mind. I created new accounts so I could do a themed island based on the Odyssey. When Odysseus was on the goddess witch Circle's island. I understand that if your playing with siblings and you don't want then to mess up your island or vice versa it can get annoying. I hope that maybe for those of you who have issues they will release an update that allows you to choose on your profile if you wish to join the residents of an existing island or forge your way on your own island.

None of the issues I faced were gamebraking and I still really enjoy the game as a whole. I'd recommend it."
AimlessImp05,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This new AC game is far beyond anything I or anyone could have hoped for. It is still AC and for those who played New Leaf you will find many similar aspects **** as the first person being the community rep like being the mayor in new leaf.

For those who read the negative views about one island per switch seem forget that you only got one town per save, 3ds, or gamecart like the previous games. If you had a digital download of new leaf you only got one town per 3ds. You get one island per switch because that's where the save data is saved to. Like a ps4 or xbox you don't save data to the disk you save to the system.
The local play could be reworked to be better but if you are done being a helper you can change leaders allowing the new leader to do everything they couldn't before. And with anything new in a series it will still need more work before it is perfected.
The only complaint i really have would be tool durability but a tool breaking is a minor inconvenience as being stung by wasps when you shake a tree and there is plenty stuff around to make new tools its not even a problem.

I honestly find my self just opening the game and listening to it so i can sleep. There is far more goals and things you can do now. And one of the best features we have always needed is the bug and fish critterpedia tells you if something has been donated so you don't need to  scour your museum to see what your missing from what you caught. This game is beyond peaceful and is the next step towards wasting months of my time like new leaf and those before it."
Lord_Awesome,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"I'm very sad to see, people reviewing just a multiplayer bug and not the game. The game is so much fun. The world is open and colorful, the quests are perfect for the series and keep you looking for goals to complete. I have visited my son's island online and hes visited mine. That seems to work perfectly. I love the characters and the interactions in the game. Again, like I said in the beginning,  don't let a bunch of review bombers keep you from enjoying this game."
DulceaBree,"Mar 25, 2020",0,I was really looking forward to this game. So I spent the first day getting my island in order and planned out. I was excited to get to play with my husband and kids...then I find that they don't get their own islands. What a **** we wanna play together we've got to buy more **** copies of the game. Greedy much?  Nintendo is the new Coronavirus.
Man2Mars,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the kind of game that will continue to be playable for years after its release.  It is playable at any pace that is comfortable for its wide range of players.  I have personally spent the majority of the last 5 days playing it, and there is still so much to do.  Because of the franchise's famous real-time progression system, it maintains a fresh feel to it everyday.  It's the sort of game I envision myself playing 20 minutes a day for the next four years, not just grinding it all out in a month.  The vast new DIY workshop system and the customization customization system adds a whole new level to the ability for the game to be made your own.  The ability to terraform he island is also a very useful feature.  Overall, the game maintains a perfect balance of combining New Leaf, Pocket Camp, and Happy Home Designer into one game with the new and improved capabilities of the Switch.  The often talked about multiplayer aspect, though it does not affect me as of yet, seems to be a major drawback and is the only thing keeping this game from achieving a score of ten.  The Switch could easily have multiple islands per unit and the fact that one can't transfer their save data to another console is also a massive inconvenience.  Nintendo needs to realize its massive standing within the gaming industry.  If it is to continue to dominate and compete with the likes of Sony and Microsoft, it must adapt and allow these seemingly basic things to occur, rather than do obviously gouging their customers into buying entirely new Switch units if they wish to have multiple islands."
hello-ev,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"This game would be so close to perfect -- the graphics are gorgeous, the new options for customization and design are excellent, and Nook Miles are a fun addition. HOWEVER, its one fatal flaw is how greatly secondary players are hamstrung, and it's enough of an issue for us that it takes a lot of my enjoyment out of the game and eclipses all the positives.

I was the one to start the game on our Switch because I had a day off work, and therefore relegated my partner's save file to being a sidekick that can't contribute to the main storyline or placement of buildings, and is stuck waiting on whatever progress I make in the game. Even though I have the ""privilege"" of being the first player and RR, my enjoyment in the game is totally shot because I know I took the ""good"" spot from my partner.

We'd GLADLY buy a second copy of the game so we could each have our own island, but we can't afford to purchase an entire second Switch just because Nintendo can't get their act together.

It's really a shame that such a great game is totally marred by this (very intentional) design flaw."
DizzleD,"Mar 25, 2020",5,Great single player! I don't know how they messed up multiplayer so badly. The restrictions are mind boggling. They made it seem like you could do so much. But you really don't have any player interaction either.
Misterspacecake,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Their is so much too do, a really relaxing game. I purchased a seperate switch for my other half which would of been a more suitable idea anyway. The attention to detail really makes this game something special."
Austen989,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Epic. Absolutely epic. It's a slow burn to start the first few days can be overwhelming and waiting for things can be tough. But 100% worth the wait. The museum alone is a 10/10 it is so impressive. The silly puns are amazing and hilarious. The villagers are adorable. Tom Nook once again offering us 0% loans for new homes, cant beat it. Island hopping is a blast . i see 30 hours of gameplay in the base game, i can't wait to see the amazing DLC to come."
Charlieboy808,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"The game is fantastic. Just as it always has been. Giving us a clean slate with absolutely nothing on the island gives us a new challenge like we've never had before.

Throwing a zero at a game because of one single thing. Shame on you."

Mnkyofthefamly,"Mar 25, 2020",8,I'm confused as to why there is such an outrage over the fact that there is only one Island per switch. There has always only ever been one town per cartridge. This complaint is EXTREMELY nonsensical and review bombing the game isn't going to help.
EthSchDI,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"The game is a wonderful, peaceful, and adorable masterpiece that is probably the best of all previous animal crossing games. Although I was initially distressed at the shared island for multiple users, now that I'm used to it it's actually a fun little feature. Overall amazing and relaxing, definitely worth it!"
Purple_monky,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"This is a fantastic **** you’re the first one on it. If you unlucky enough to be the second one, and can’t shell out the money to buy a whole new switch and game, then your stuck being just a visitor with a house. You have no control over what happens on the island apart from being able to decorate your house and pick up weeds. Being one island per console is bad but essentially one player per console is terrible. I’ve been a fan of animal crossing for so long and loved everyone of them but if they had told us of these limitations before release I would not have bought it."
Courier69,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"Improves on the premise of the old games well while adding all new mechanics. Having tons of fun so far, and leaving this review mostly to combat the idiots review bombing over the small flaws this game has."
GarethKale,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Bought this with the intention to have 3 people play on my Switch, just to find out we can't start out own campaigns or do things the first player does.  The feature to save your own campaign on a console has been around for 20 years, and is solely a money-grabbing technique to make us buy another switch.  Hugely disappointed as I thought Nintendo was above this kind of scheme."
Vilhelm55,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This game is fantastic. What else can I say? It runs well on the Switch. The only issue that I have is that apparently the fishing tourney is timed to just 3 minutes. That ****, but I think I can get over it : D"

SeanBob,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This game is absolutely charming! At first, I was saddened that my wife and I couldn't have our own island, but then I realized Animal Crossing has never set itself up this way- since the original! Then I realized it would be a wonderful challenge to develop this island together. Each day we compare the things that we've done, and help each other make wonderful little homes and neighbors on our ""Muffintown.""

This has been a wonderfully **** relationship builder for the two of us. Thanks Nintendo!"

realPhali,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"I'm sure this is a great game if you live on your own or have a Switch all to yourself. If you don't; well, bad news - this is basically a one player per console kinda deal. If you have kids or share a console with a loved one - don't waste your money on this."
Giblets,"Mar 25, 2020",6,"Fun game. Highly polished single-player experience. However, the multiplayer/single island per console has soured my feelings about the game.

The game experience for the second resident (P2) is considerably different and IMO lesser than that of the ""island representative"" (P1). As P2 I have very little control or influence over what is built in the town and where. I cannot contribute directly to town projects with my resources. I am prevented from unlocking certain recipes. I am prevented from using certain tools until P1 unlocks them as part of the story.

The only way for multiple players to get the full experience of building and refining their own island is to buy multiple consoles. I don't interpret this as malice/greed so much as an oversight. What works for a handheld does not necessarily work for a home console like the switch.

As it stands I recommend the game for single players, but I cannot fully recommend the game to anyone sharing a console."
bumblebutts,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This is a wonderful game that doesn’t deserve these petty 0 review scores. You have a problem? Contact Nintendo.

I love playing multiplayer with my online friends and collecting all the fossils, bugs, and fish for the absolutely gorgeous museum. The new interior design mechanics are a lifesaver and I love this game so much. Please give it a try, and don’t listen to those petty 0 reviews akin to a whiny five year old child not getting what they want."
aramil59,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Its hard to look at the game play for this one. If its fun, charming addictive, interesting or any other characteristic for a good is spoiled by the fact only one person can play a real game per Switch and copy of the game you own. Only one players can progress or make choices. I'm sure it was posted hidden on a description of the game somewhere but i didn't know it until I already bought the game. No other game i have ever owned has such a terrible ""feature"" I dont understand why they would put that in and its hard to get over.

Do not buy this game if you plan for it to be shared with people in your household. Everything else in the game doesn't really matter how good it is if you only 50% or less of the people you planned to let play it can not."
Bytxs,"Mar 25, 2020",5,This  game is great but the fact that it limits the full experience to one person is terrible. Please Nintendo fix your game.
SSWAGNER,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"I decided to tune in and let everyone reading know that Animal crossing New Horizons is a wonderful game in the Animal crossing series. The sales and positive reviews speak for itself, but there is a lot that could be improved. I would of liked to see more streamlined menus, sometimes when selling and navigating menus it can be a bit slow, an option to speed things up would of been nice, and with the multiplayer, I think the way we invite other players to our town could of been more streamlined and have less loading screens.

One big complaint people have is with the way Nintendo decided to handle multiple users playing. You can only have 1 island, and the first person to launch the game is basically the one in charge, the 2nd player has a slightly limited experience, for instance, you have  to wait for the 1st player to trigger certain events such as building Tom nooks store, or deciding on where to place a bridge, and until they do that, your island will be kind of locked in a state where you don't have access to those things until player 1 unlocks them. On one hand it is a bad decision, given how there are better ways this could of been managed, but on the other hand this is Nintendo, and their vision, and this is how all animal crossing games have been more or less. However I think they should of went the extra step with multiple residents living together and I hope that they can improve things even more in the coming patches or next release.

While this game is amazing and has things that can be improved, I think a lot of the review bombing is from people that have a serious case of ""You didn't make the game I wanted you to make and now i'm upset"". Life goes on people, you don't like something, speak up, but review bombing a game in this manner is just silly.

It add new and interesting game play that makes your island yours. Now you will e seeing reviews annoyed Bout the how you can only have 1 island per console.

That's a very lame way to make people buy a brand-new console just for one game. The Switch is supposed to be a familial console and this came is not."
Lechi,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Overall is a fun game but Nintendo needs to change their user treatment.

Gravydog,"Mar 25, 2020",0,This game was an utter let down. I’ve been playing games all my life but never had the chance to play any games in the animal crossing series. My girlfriend was overtly excited about this new game and I figured I would purchase this for her and I could enjoy something refreshing and new. She plays all day when I bought it and I tried to start my own island the following day. One island per switch is crap and I’m not even going to try and play this game. You lost a potential player. I made an account on Metacritic strictly to relay my disgust.
BootySage,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Money grubbing one island per switch feature demonstrates that the Nintendo of today is no different than the EAs of the world. Nintendo would rather give themselves the chance to move more Switch units than give their fans a proper game they can enjoy with their families during this time of panic and uncertainty. Do better Nintendo.
SgtKnux,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"I was upset at first about ""one island per console,"" but because of it I've found the value in their decision.  My wife and I leave little surprises and gifts for each other since we're co-located, and nothing is really lost progression-wise.  If she gets something setup first, then I can still attend ceremonies and experience the ""newness"" of the island growing.  Though the museum's donations are shared (which I like), you still have to find things yourself for them to be added to your ""creature codex"" so progression issues are not felt.  I can understand people want their own unique island so they can fly to each others' and visit and whatnot, but so much Animal Crossing Charm comes from sharing your space.

Just make sure you buy doctors masks and gift them out."
Catzalot,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Honestly a lovely game. I understand frustrations with the island restrictions, but this game is still a 10/10 for me. It's not a game you win, just a game you play, which often is just what I need.
If you need a relaxing, psuedo-life sim, this is your game."
kDidz,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This game is the culmination of all the previous versions in one. It's perfect a game and I can't think of the developers enough. Some people are complaining that there's no goals, when you're daily tasks and goals are rewarded with Nook Points to keep you motivated. The whole point to this game is to relax, enjoy and do whatever you want to a deserted island to make it feel like home to you. Craft furniture. Fly to other islands. Have mega 8 player party popper fests with a voice chat feature through your phone. Amazing. Are there some flaws? Yes, but every game does. People who are rating it zero don't know what their talking about. I highly recommend this game for it just being so pure and wholesome and just so enjoyable."
W4z0,"Mar 25, 2020",0,I really love the game! But being the second player **** so bad! You cant participate in the story and miss a ton of diy recipe. It just kill my experience!
Queanie,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"This game was definitely worth the wait! Starting New Horizons brought me back to the very first time I played Population Growing - learning and exploring the game in its unique way. The level of attention to detail and atmosphere that was put into it makes each play session a relaxing and enjoyable experience. As a veteran of the series, I can appreciate its reworking of past installments' features such as the message-in-a-bottle from Wild World and the crafting introduced in Pocket Camp. My sister and I are roommates and share a Switch, and yes, it's disappointing that we can't have separate islands on one console. However, the co-op mechanic has potential. It's not a perfect game, but it comes pretty close."
SabooKazoo,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Amazingly fun, never gets old, never run out of things to do. Graphics are extremely well done. The creativity and options are awesome. Absolutely fantastic game!!"
Tanukky,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"A very cute and refreshing Animal Crossing game. It offers beautiful graphics and motivation through ""setting your own goals"", especially with the Nook Miles. Offers many improvements like the tool ring.

The only thing I need to complain is the long ""tutorial phase"". It could be a little bit boring and during this time, you'll hear the same bgm. Also I have the feeling the animal villagers are a little bit dull and are annoyed very fast.
And there are some things I'm missing like the cafe. I hope they'll improve (villagers dialogues) and add those things in an update.

In overall, it's a lovely new Animal Crossing with some flaws. It was worth the long wait. I don't understand the negative review bomb. It was known for a long time that you can have one island per console. //shrug"
Smeez,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Love the game! People should stop whining about one island per switch and learn to share and team play instead. While there are some minor minuses (loading time when travel or no split screen in multiplayer), this game is still an amazing update and makes it the best game in the series!"
SomeJerk,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Really a fun game.  The people posting 0/10 because they can't have their own island are just pitching a hissyfit.
gemiki,"Mar 25, 2020",2,"The game is nice, if you are the first player and therefore the 'owner' of the island. If you are second player, you are tied to the progress of the first, which is really annoying and takes away from the game. Basically only the first player has some kind of story, all others just don't, therefore it is just plain boring.
Sharing the island in itself is no problem for me at all, but not being able to do all things I want to do, without switching character, is.
Otherwise it is quite relaxing, as animal crossing always was. The tools breaking can be annoying at times, too, but you learn to work around it. The graphics are super cute, and being able to create the clothing I want is great, too."
Cowless,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"For all those people complaining about one town per switch it must **** to ****. Jeez, if I had someone else in my household that wanted to play switch I'd get them their own regardless of if it was for animal crossing or another game. I like having my own save data and it's not like two switches aren't basically the same price as the other main consoles or anything?? Lol not denying that having multiple people on one switch, one island doesn't kinda **** compared to the rest of it there are just easy ways around the issue. Wouldn't you want your own personal switch? Playing coop is one thing but why share the console fully/directly?

Game is 10/10"
amatzx,"Mar 25, 2020",6,"The game content is great and and looks gorgeous. While the game mechanics is almost perfect - for the primary player at least. The game should provide equal experience across Switch users/profiles, be it the one who played the game first or the secondary players. If Nintendo fix this issue, I would give this game a perfect score in an instant."
NooksPlan,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This is just the game the world needed. I could not be more grateful to Nintendo for bringing back their best series for disassociating weirdos like me at a time where we all could use a sunny vacation. Thank you.
If you're out here being a little resetti about a switch not allowing more than one island per console? Guess what buttercup? The bloody GameCube did the EXACT SAME THING. GET OVER YOURSELVES AND SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Thanks, Nook Inc."
BHC2463,"Mar 25, 2020",2,I created a metacritic account just so I could rant about this **** island sharing is stupid. I play a lot faster than my sister and so she isn't getting to do as much of the stuff as I am and she is angry about it. Will Nintendo fix it? I kinda doubt it... And anyways the damage is already done.
Sjcisnshs,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Imagine leaving a 0 or 1 star over one dumb thing. This game series has evolved so much since the previous ones and it has so many neat features that make the game great, such as dropping off multiple fossils at once and a lot of character customization options. And the graphics are amazing. You're all just a bunch of angry Karens"
LukasGibson,"Mar 25, 2020",10,I think everyone on here bashing it and giving it’s a 0 because Nintendo locked it to one island per console is an ****. So I’m rating it 10/10 to offset all of the negative reviews. Enjoy buying 2 switches!
CountPrinky,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This game is excellent, lots of these bad reviews are not accurate. Multi player is amazingly fun, but yes does require a second switch. (Not unlike how gameboys have always been....) the game doesnt box you in with ""quests"", help build up your own island community, decorate where ever you want! Ignore the bad reviews."
Beep_Beep,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Yes the decision to allow only one island per switch is silly, but that does not mean the game is an automatic 0. Animal Crossing was always like this anyway. The game starts a bit slow, but there is still plenty to do thanks to the new feature of nook **** game has plenty of content and features new to the series, but but none feel out of place in the world of Animal Crossing. Animal Crossing New Horizons is something that both longtime fans and newcomers to the series can enjoy."
mbgreenleaf,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"While I totally agree that only allowing one island per Switch is a garbage move by Nintendo, everything else about this game is a 10/10."
Daddyzgirl,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Being restricted to one island per system is absolutely infuriating for a game like this. The island is too small/resources scarce to add other players and progress is tied to the first person who made the account. Now only one member of my household can play the game and  ever and it’s really terrible. I understand that this was a feature of the older games, but it is one of the worst features I have ever experienced with any game for this particular one."
meganpachira,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Definitely the best Animal Crossing game, my fave switch game too probably. The games have always been made for sharing and it was common knowledge before release that it was one island per console. People be butthurt"
Jamejarrs,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"An amazing entry in an amazing series. I love having the ability to craft and customize my own furniture, and this game gives you way more power than you've ever had to make your town exactly how you want.

Opening the gates to your island and just hanging out with friends while you fish and catch bugs is so much fun. This game came out at the perfect time given current circumstances.

I'm not time travelling, and I'm enjoying the laid-back pace of the game. Every day gives you a small task to complete and a new visitor to your island. Taking things in slowly gives you a good idea of the aspects of the island you like and what you should change later.

If you're sharing a console, the inability to complete tasks for anyone other than the first user is a serious downside, but if you're playing this on your own Switch then it doesn't affect you. My partner and I are both enjoying the game on our own islands and it's unfortunate some people aren't having the same experience.

A must-own Switch exclusive, but I'm sure you already knew that."
InvictusTheNerd,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Anyone rate bombing this game for one bad feature needs to stop you dumb and you should feel bad
NiklasZeroZero,"Mar 25, 2020",2,"This may be one of the cutest and most light hearted games I ever played... Or to be precise: I ever tried to play, because I was only the second person on my Switch to start the game. I've never played AC before and through: ""Well... This is quite boring."" Until I learned no, its not, its only because my Girlfriend started it first. If there is more than one person who wanrs to play this game: DO NOT BUY IT!"

npcuzzupe,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Although the game is fun and relaxing, I bought it purely for the multiplayer couch coop with my wife... where the game excels in single player gameplay it falls flat on its face with couch coop multiplayer... it’s so painful to play together we Have resorted to taking turns playing single player... wish AC would’ve gotten this right...maybe an update in the future will make it more enjoyable for families to play together..."
dfoote2010,"Mar 25, 2020",0,Only one island per console? Way to capitalize Nintendo...definately not worth it.
acnhisbad,"Mar 25, 2020",4,"I am reviewing this as someone who is not playing as the ""island representative"" (not the primary player).
Nintendo's decision to limit the actions of people playing local multiplayer is garbage. They are telling people who love this franchise to buy a second switch or go f*** themselves.
My partner bought the game for us to play together and 6 days in, they have almost 40 furniture recipes and I (who has played the same amount as they have) only have 15. The game severely limits what the second+ players can do in the game to the point of making it feel like a bad animal crossing game.
I'd even accept being able to buy all the DIY recipes the primary player receives, but at the time of writing this is impossible and player 2 will NEVER be able to build a peach chair.
It's so strange that Nintendo would acknowledge that the Switch is a console that is sharable and to be used by more than one person (Pokemon SWSH allows multiple save accounts per switch so they know several people will play each game on a single console) but turn around and make the game so garbage for everyone but the first to play it.
I'm sure I'd love the game if I started playing first, but speaking as someone who did not, fix your s*** Nintendo."
Notsoawesomelee,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"The fact that the primary player (the first person to play the game) is the only person who has full access to the game is nonsensical. Basic features such as obtaining tools are locked to secondary players if the primary player has not unlocked them yet. This makes it hard to play the game as a family. There cannot be cooperation to share an island if members on the island are not equals. Moreover, there is no indication when you set up the game that primary players will be the only account with full access to the game. This means if you set an account up for your child, parent, partner or any other player who will not play it full time, you can only progress insofar they have unlocked these features for the game for you. Very annoying and seems like either Nintendo has done this for financial gain or they do not have the ability to have more than one island on each save file. Take your pick"
ammeanas,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Don't listen to the whiners. great game. it is exactly what it should be.  yes it's different. yes you are very bottle necked if you want two or more people getting the full game experience without buying multiple copies. to all you people who want free games because they owe us shut up. stop buying  games if you just whine every time. they limited us to one island to stop you all from cheating to get everything like every other game
StacyFire,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"I've been playing the game nonstop everyday, I love it! This game came out at the perfect time seeing as how everyone is locked in their homes"
Kitsunuki,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"It's an amazing daily time waster I enjoy. It could be improved sure,  maybe next iteration, but as of now the formulae works and I am fine with this version.  Also if they were to make it open world or have an infinite amount of towns, your town wouldn't mean anything or be special.  It wouldn't be Animal Crossing."
Archangel0528,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"The game is utterly fantastic. With the core functions of the old games and the new functions added in, the game is a brilliant blend of nostalgia and a breath of fresh air. Animal Crossing continues to be a relaxing experience for the player and maintains its charm in New Horizons. It's nice to have a new spin on the things we're used to seeing from an Animal Crossing game.

In regards to those reviews being left that are upset about there only being one island per console, I share this. From Nintendo themselves on the official Animal Crossing New Horizons website: ""Up to eight Nintendo Account holders can live on the same island within each game. With one Nintendo Switch system and one game, up to four of those Nintendo Account holders can play on the same island at the same time (additional accessories required). With additional systems and games, up to eight players can play on the same island at the same time via local wireless or online play. Nintendo Switch Online membership and Nintendo Account required for online features.""

This was clearly stated before the player even purchased the game. This is the way that animal crossing has always been. 1 island per console. The fact that you are even able to have multiple villagers from the same console playing together on the island at the same time is unique to this game only in the series. And they've actually upped this from the typical 4 villagers living in one town to now 8 villagers living on one island, allowing larger families to have unique villagers for each family member. Why would you have multiple islands to choose from on a game that has historically only ever had one town per console, regardless of the type of system the player is using? Playing on a family Wii console with City Folk? One town. Playing on a personal handheld console with Wild World or New Leaf? One town. Just read the information on the game functionality before you buy a game. The game is great all around and is one for the books, just remember to read what the game-play is before you purchase a game."
TheShade_,"Mar 25, 2020",10,This is the best animal crossing game! So addicting! There is so many things to do!
ZealFox,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"This is probably, no definitely the best Animal Crossing game yet. The objective system is great, and starting from a desolate island and ending with a thriving village is incredible. The multiplayer, at least local, could use some work, bad its not as bad as some people would have you think. Online is fine, and its how I expected, if not a little clunkier. The limitation of one town per switch I see could bother some people, but I know quite a few that love living in one town together with their family. Overall, the game is solid, and I wouod reccomend it to everyone."
Shmelkin,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"I was waiting for this game about a month. This is my first game in series. Was very excited about living on the island with my wife. The game is awesome. Graphics, activity, visiting other players islands, postcards, mails, etc.

But my personal score is 5/10.

Why? Well because my wife landed on the island first. And now im living on my wifes island. Thats right. This is NOT our island. Second player have NO rights. He can just run around, gather stuff, catch fishes, sometimes help the first player collecting resources for new buildings. Is it interesting for the second player? I dont think so. The progress of the second player fully depends from the first player. This is a HUGE disapointment.

I hope Nintendo will give us the oportunity to delegate authority of the Speaker (russian version of the game) to second player."
DomristVivaldis,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Очень классная, хорошая, добрая игра! Всем рекомендую, игра на пару лет прохождения!) делал предзаказ на Нинтендо свитч 20.03.2020 года.

Thatguy97,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Bought because my girlfriend was so excited to play, I worked nightshift the next day so she told me to play first at midnight and report how good it was. I thought it was great until I realized that my girlfriend was player 2 and was greatly upset that she had no progression or objectives in the game. The fact that Nintendo would think in any way that this is appropriate. Thank god I don't have kids to fight over who's a mayor!"
YUmiN,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"The developers worked very hard on all the details in this version of the game. Haters are complaining about a pre-existing mechanic in all other versions, and it's an animal crossing premise. I just loved this game and I have no complaints. Even the high price I feel is a fair value for the product."
GuapoGamer,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"What a phenomenal game. The graphics are gorgeous, the characters are lovely, the scenery is charming and all around, it's a perfect game. It calms you down, lets you take a breather from the hellish world that is where we are currently, and envelops you in a beautiful, serene paradise where you have nothing to do and nowhere to go, except for making a few friends and maybe making some money along the way. Please purchase this game, it's so, so worth it."
Beeees,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Honestly the only thing that's kept me sane through the whole Corona thing.

Works perfectly for the switch and I've really appreciated it even more so during this global crisis. Spending time developing your own personal island with friendly animal residents cheering you along the way. Trust me, you dont want to miss out on this game, Nintendo have promised regular updates with special events relating to current seasons etc. Non stop content for all!"

Kindofarascal,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"As a long time Animal Crossing player I wholeheartedly recommend this new title to fans of AC, it has all the upgrades I've been hoping for! The opening is a bit slow but the pacing picks up steadily. My roommates and I have been loving this game! It's worth noting we're all adults with our own consoles though. To new time player's wondering if this game is for them: my best advice is check out some gameplay video on YouTube, what you see is what you get. Put succinctly Animal Crossing is a charming city simulation game, it doesn't have a grand narrative.  Lastly, I don't understand why people are tearing down New Horizons for the island limit, Animal Crossing has always had this limit. It's not surprising. The appeal of multiplayer has always been playing together across multiple consoles, each player with their own screen and full range of controls, Nintendo released the Switch Lite in anticipation of this. The Switch is meant to be the successor of Nintendo's home and handheld consoles, it has the assets of both, tv play and on-the-go functionality. Animal Crossing New Horizons doesn't need to be docked to get the most out of the game, a Switch Lite is perfect for people who want to play this game without committing to a full ticket Switch."

Vekks,"Mar 25, 2020",0,The one island per switch is a real bummer. It's less a feature and more a restriction (especially if you're the second player) It feels like Nintendo is trying to force consumers to buy a second switch (or more).
YuexinZ,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Por este juego vale la pena comprarse una switch. Con lo que te dura el juego -infinito- y lo adictivo que es ,lo amortizas fijo. Tiene mucha personalidad. Está en el top de juegos de exclusivos switch. Pruébalo si nunca has jugado un Animal Crossing, quizá te enganches."
YoloSwagersarus,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"The game is okay but the local multiplayer experience is terrible. One island per console is not so bad, but the fact that subsequent players cannot progress in the game and only the first player (who becomes the island representative) can advance the island is nonsensical. Also, many DIY recipes are only available to the first player, so if I want a bed in my house I have to get resources, give them to my gf (who is the first player) and have her make them for me and then get them.

It is clearly a move made so that Nintendo can sell more consoles and greatly anti-consumer. Hopefully if we get angry enough about this they will change that, otherwise they have no reason to."
DanielMN,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Llevo jugando a Animal Crossing desde Gamecube y éste seguramente sea el mejor de la saga. Son muchos los añadidos para la ocasión, mantiene la esencia y potencia lo que lo hacía único. Así es como se mejora un juego que ya era bueno. Bravísimo."
kaylers,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Totally unfair that users are slamming this game with a 0/10 review for the 1-island-per-console issue. Yes, it really does ****.

The detail, the nook miles system, the nook phone, the creative ways they snuck in old themes (Dodo Airlines in place of Tortimer!) — they are worth at least a few points! don’t drag down a beautiful game with a 0/10 rating for one issue, even if it is worth the loss of a couple points."

yoki76,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"The game is beautiful and very charming, but the fact that you can only have one single island per console is totally ruining the experience for us at home. The three of us (kid, wife and me) were so looking forward to this game, only to be terribly disappointed to find that only the creator of the island can progress through the story of the game.

Worst of all, a new copy of the game won't fix this problem, only buying another Nintendo Switch console (two new consoles in our case to be precise) would do, this is absolutely crazy in 2020. Please Nintendo fix this nonsense."
JohnX152634,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"While animal crossing is a great game a few things from Nintendo really ruins this game. One is the fact that you get One Island per Console! My family has one switch for 3 users meaning that I had to start on a island which was already developed. So to have the full experience I would have to by a new switch. Secondly, Nintendo seems to be taking down most of the videos made of this game including pure gameplay. I've clicked on many videos on animal crossing which then said Nintendo took it down due to copy-right. So overall it is a good game tarnished by another greedy corporation."
HarrianFinny,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"A wonderful relaxing experience. From the music to the visuals this game is just so cute and fun on so many levels and I cant wait to sink my teeth into more.

10/10 not the best game ever but addictive and fun."
Maciv,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"So you get this game during the 2020 pandemic. You are most stuck inside your house. And even under those circumstances, where every distraction is welcome, the game is still immensely enjoyable. My personal recommendation is to play the game whatever way you want it. Don't get hung up on how other people are playing it. Just sit down, play it, do whatever you want and is possible. You want to turn it into work by working away at paying those house loans off? Go ahead! You want to just play a little bit each day and hang out with the villagers? Nobody is telling you not to! Want to make a little tropical paradise on the island? Enjoy yourself!"

beesontoas,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Unplayable for more than one child.
Set up in such a way that it's pretty much unplayable outside of singleplayer. You have to buy a whole other switch and game if you want peace and quiet out of kids playing. Dirty practise from a company renowned for making family games.
Outside of the cash gouging, very little of the game mechanics is explained, especially if you're the second person to jump in and try to play.
Items are trapped behinds arbitrary walls put in place by Tom nook, in single player, that's frustrating, the resources needed for multiple people to achieve this kinda makes it somewhat miserable to play.
Sure, it's cute, sure the music is nice, but you can get all of that from the old games

I think the scores of ten are coming from people treating this as a sacred cow..."
aortaclogger,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"Game is completed ruined for all subsequent users if the first player to open the game and set up the island stops playing.

Give each user their own island WTF"

I've faithfully bought every nintendo console, and every Animal Crossing game, and New Horizons was no exception. Leading up to the launch I was hesitant and skeptical, but still full of hype and excitement. As the game started nearing towards launch I started getting worried about the lack of content shown, and the rumors of removing gender-related content.

Indeed it seems both worries ended up being genuine and it turns out that New Horizons has received *massive* cuts compared to older games. I'll start with my chief complaint which is that the ability to play as a girl has been removed entirely, at least to my knowledge. There is a ""gender"" option at the beginning of the game which does nothing, and characters misgender you regardless of what you pick. Feminine walk/run animations were removed entirely. Likewise all gendered comments (including compliments) were removed. The game makes no reference to gender at all to the point of misgendering people. The option is basically there to lull you into a false sense of security.

Most of the game's content is locked behind weeks worth of waiting, which is particularly bad for an AC game but not unprecedented. The game shipped without *any* holidays, and requires online connectivity to access such content. More or less every major Animal Crossing character has been cut from the game (including Redd, Katrina, Brewster, Harriet, Rover, Kapp'n, etc.). Despite AC usually being about freedom of choice, the game pretty much railroads you for the first several days (as opposed to the usual quick tutorial sequence). It's already been almost a week and despite going at full pace, able sisters are nowhere to be seen (they come after about 2 weeks, instead of the usual which is being there immediately)..

Patterns are ""back"", but not the way you'd like. To get full use out of it you also need a 3DS and copy of New Leaf, so that you can make certain patterns inside of that game, make a QR, then get your phone, scan the QR, making sure you pay the monthly fee for Nintendo's online service. Only *then* can you get every type of clothing in the pattern maker. NH lacks certain pattern options so you have to scan them in. There *is* a few more options which is nice, but it's not as much as I'd hoped.

Art is removed entirely as redd is gone. Gyroids are gone entirely.

The positives of the game are the nook miles system, which I wasn't very excited for despite it being a solid addition, and the crafting. Crafting is fun, but is just the usual furniture system albeit with an extra step (collecting resources) which means the process to collect furniture is now even *slower* than before. The game is lacking in content and to make up for it they drip-feed the existing content at a snails pace (much slower than previous entries).

I really like that you can send letters to IRL friends without having to visit their town, which makes the letter sending feature actually useful. Terraforming seems cool but is end game so I don't have that yet. My complaint about AC: New Horizons is the exact same complaint I had about Zelda: Breath of the Wild: it's a great engine, but there's no game there.

All in all what i usually come to Animal Crossing for is an affirming creative space where I can be myself and talk with the virtual npcs who can act as affirming and supportive friends. You won't find that here. The villagers in game have repetitive stale dialogue, misgender you and your IRL friends, and are very lacking for the first week (you only start with 2 and get a third after almost a week in). On the plus side the animations and actions they can perform are much more detailed and involved which is great.

All in all this feels more like an animal crossing engine with injected transphobia, sexism, and hate. If you're looking at animal crossing because it seems like a cute welcoming game where you can get creative and relax.... you're better off with New Leaf, as New Horizons is just kinda a let down. I know looking back I'll probably revisit NL rather than NH. Perhaps I missed something? This may be the last AC game I buy if things continue like this."
Rhuido,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"A game that is thought for the family and is about sharing, this is where it fails. A game meant to have family and friends playing together, only in fact, allows one island per Switch console and caps the other users of the  Switch to the development and choices of the first user. Simple example: collect all the fruits for your own user and you'll be selfish enough not to give your younger sister the fruits she so deserved. I'm sorry Nintendo, I don't feel good about being selfish to my younger sister, that's not how my parents raised me. I can't agree with this choice from Nintendo and it actually concerns me why they would make such a choice for a family game."
fknintendo,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"**** this greedy, piece of **** corporate bull**** company. The one island per switch is the most blatantly greedy move ever. Their argument was to have multiple players work together to build the island, which sounds great on paper, but the second player literally cannot do jack **** to contribute to the island. So not only did they not allow multiple islands, they also did not follow up on a viable alternative.  What a bunch of scumbags.They are using EA as a role model and only thinking about profits rather than user experience. I will not be purchasing a single switch game anymore from now on. Good thing PS5 is coming out soon."
GabsLidDav,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Just about the happiest game available right now! The game continues with the cute AC style from all the other games, but gives you loads more options to customise your characters face, hair and outfit. It combines some of the home design from HHD and the crafting element of Pocket Camp to make the game different enough from its predecessors. It's a tad monotonous at times, just like all the AC games, but it's the perfect way to kill time while the world's on lock down! You can only have 1 Town per switch, but that's the same as all the previous AC games, like New Leaf and Wild World. There is always pleanty to do, but you can play at your own speed, getting lots done every day, or hardly anything at all!"
Nicklasos,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"The game is really great, enjoy it since release day, but one island is just unacceptable!"
Namine_Zenitram,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"More of 7 1/2 than an 8...I've always loved the animal crossing series. But of course there are always some kind of problems. Its Nintendo, we all know that they make a lot of decisions because they want that $$$. We still give in and buy the games anyway. That being said here's some things I found wrong.

1st, the one island per switch situation. We all know about it by now. We all dislike that decision. I'm not gonna go in on how dumb that is. Especially since I'm one of the lucky house holds with 2 switches. 2nd, you can't go on the mystery island tours with local or online players. One of my friends and I's favorite part of new leaf was going on the island tours together. Felt like this is taking a step backwards.

3rd, we STILL can't kick out villagers once they moved in, just like new leaf you have to wait for the villager to make the suggestion to move, then say ok. Which ****, cuz when nook gives you the task of placing the 3 houses for the new comers, you don't know who it will be until after you've finished making the furniture for said villagers. (Snooty jerks should start out in tents like the rest of us btw. But that's another topic all together). That is unless you had the nook miles to fly to 3 islands, happen to come across and convince 3 villagers you actually want to move into your island, b4 the task was given. Then and only then will you know who's moving in. Which feels like a slap in the face, since Nintendo advertised this game to let us pick and choose villagers 24/7.

4th, not being able to relocate the plaza, airport, river openings and the mineable rocks. dont have to explain why this is flawed.

5th, the museum dosent give you explanations on the bugs, fish or fossils once you found all the peices. In new leaf, once you donated something you can go in and read up a little info on what you found. Now you just look it up on your ""collections app"" or blathers can tell you about the bug/fish/fossils you find, if you have it in your inventory. Again felt like a step backwards.

6th, took away the choice of what room to build. In new leaf you can choose what rooms to build in your home. My old house had only the back room, attic and basement done. I wanted to recreate that house. Only for nook to tell me that the back room was going to be made frist, then the side room...again step backwards.

7th, not being able to put qr designs on all furniture items. Also some items not being customizable at all. Example, fence that I wish I could paint white, instead of buying the specific white version. Or wanting to put a custom color on the bed frame, not just the sheets.

8th, no way to load your self made qr designs, from new leaf/happy home, to the switch. If you remembered to take a picture of every qr code for every design you made, congratulations! You can use the Nintendo app and download a non-editable version onto the **** you have Nintendo online. Locking, what was free in the last series, behind a paywall now is just shameful. People would have gotten Nintendo online for the ability to visit friends islands as it is. Which leads me to the final complaint.

You know what really would have made people want to get Nintendo online for this game? CLOUD SAVES! They took away cloud saves to stop cheaters, yet people found a money glitch litterly on the release **** if you look past all these frustrations, the game is very relaxing and a fun time waster. A lot of these problems could be fixed with an update, so who knows what the future holds."
nelsonslv,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"don’t know why the user score is so low, you're crazy. this is PERFECT! this was my most anticipated game for the switch and i am completely overwhelmed"
hamstermajszter,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"I tried to play a game as a second play on the Switch and I realized that nothing left to do for me. My gf shook every trees, collected every rocks, built everything, and after 10 minutes, I couldn't do anything. I just roaming around without an axe or any other tool. What can I say, excellent experience..."

Thecookiegamer,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"already my 2020 goty, played it for about 35 hours now and i love it!!!!!!!"
Mimikins,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"For all of the people who are upset about there being one island per switch, this has actually always the way animal crossing has been. It saddens me to see such a masterpiece be downrated all the way to zero just because new players don't understand the animal crossing franchise , or did no research before buying. Nintendo explained it would be one island per person a long time ago before release. With that out of the way, let me review the game as an experienced animal crossing player.. New Horizons"
hanniecrossing,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This is the best game of the series. It combines all of the best elements of the previous games and whips them into something magical, while still introducing new elements to create an overall fantastic game. It's also extremely aesthetically pleasing to look at, which is a huge plus. I bought the game the day it came out and cannot stop playing. While other games in the series I could only play for about 30 minutes out of the day before feeling bored or like there was nothing to do, I find myself playing this one for hours and still feeling like I could do more. Overall, amazing game, and I can't wait to play it for years to come."
OwlWings25,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Another peaceful and relaxing game from Animal Crossing. I love the cute characters that you can have move in to your island and all the customisation options. I also love how it’s done in real time. It keeps you coming back for more!
werekitten,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"This is essentially a remake of the original animal crossing and it’s beyond amazing. I know a lot of people are mad because they have to share their island with the people that they actually physically live with in the real world but that’s how animal crossing games have always been. Back in the day you could add people you lived with to your town but you could only play one at a time, now you can actually have two people play at the same time which is, like I said before... amazing!! If you don’t wish to exist on the same island as the people you live with I wouldn’t blame the game for that, seems like that is something that is a much deeper more personal issue"
REPSAJ,"Mar 25, 2020",7,"This is arguably the best Animal Crossing yet, but for returning players it might be a pretty disappointing experience.

I somehow wish this could be my first AC experience, as the game is full of things to discover and do, and undoubtedly has that animal crossing magic of the previous games.

Unfortunately, it also is plagued by the same annoyances of the previous games such as the cumbersome interface, and it does not add a whole lot of new and interesting gameplay mechanics and improvements to entertain returning animal crossing veterans. To me, it seems like nintendo was a bit lazy with this one.

I was really looking forward to this game, but after a week of playing it, its hard to shake the thought im essentially playing a game that hasnt changed any core mechanics to entertain long time players. Which ****, as i would have loved  to dive into animal crossing once again, but there is just too little incentive for me to go on my third animal crossing adventure.

Tldr: been there, done that"
MarcSeriesX,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"It is a very good and calm game. I love the graphics (finally in HD!). The bad thing is that you only have one island per switch and it doesn't have a split screen. It is a shame, but there is time to improve it. I think if you like quiet games or are a fan of the saga, this will be your favorite."

LexGear,"Mar 25, 2020",0,I spent days ignoring negative feedback and wondering why I couldnt make progress in the game. Turns out anyone aside from the first person to arrive at the island can't do jack. All I can do is collect sticks and bugs. This is a massively disappointing experience. No game here.
LolInTheDark,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"I'm not the kind of user to go down and rate-bomb titles, but this time I'm being honest, rating this game as a SECOND PLAYER ON CONSOLE. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one thinking that, given the second player experience is reduced, no effort was put into giving him any reason to keep playing.
Nothing worth doing except grinding instead of 1st player in order to get him to unlock stuff. You are literally on a master-slave kind of relation.
Honestly, I've paid a full game, I've been paying 2 separate Nintendo Online subscription and that's not what I expected from ANY game.
Embarrassing to say the least."
nerros,"Mar 25, 2020",3,Good game if it on your own personal switch but if you share it with anyone that also wants to play the game it's not. You have to share the same island but that's nothing new the big thing is that if you wanted to progress through the game to unlock stuff you have to be the first person to start the game otherwise you're not going to be able to. If you have a switch and more than one kid who plays it don't get them this game because it will bring nothing but trouble with it.
Cephey,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"I hate HATERS, i set 0 to all heaters! There is no anymore point in user score when just some dump haters set 0, and that mean NOTHING."
Yayuko,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"Nintendo is a great videogame company, but with this treatment so bad that it have given us, almost forcing us to buy another Switch if we want to play with someone, it is something that I cannot tolerate"
madz6297,"Mar 25, 2020",10,This game is fantastic. It is made with love and care and is packed with new features. It's pitiful that people are lowering ACNH's user score for a sharing an island (Animal Crossing has always had every user play in one town) and having to work more to make things (remaking tools is so simple and does add to the theme that you are exploring and creating this new island). The devs have supplied us with sooo much of what we asked for (literally the majority of what people did when hacking their saves in acnl). The team listened to the AC community and they should be proud of their work ♡
Nintai,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"If you've played the Animal Crossing franchise ever before, you'll know that the reviews about 1 island per console are trivial and nothing new. People want to make multiple accounts on their switch, create different islands, and hop over their islands to mass consume resources. Simply put, they're complaining because they can't cheat.

The game brings back some great old mechanics like the money treesand the museum is downright beautiful. It's everything I expected and wanted from an AC game for years!"
Aapo,"Mar 25, 2020",10,Absolute Joy! It is just so fun and relaxing! And i hate you people who are bombing The reviews down cause u dont get your two islands per console **** you

NaLuver,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Amazing graphics, gameplay, and more. A great spin on other classic animal crossing games, the characters are more full of life, and there's SO. MUCH. TO DO! The *only* reason this game is getting negative reviews is because people are mad about some of it's multiplayer features. But Nintendo made it clear how it was going to be, from the get-go"
Missjessicasage,"Mar 25, 2020",3,"Only ONE island per switch? Are you guys crazy? Already having a hard enough time finding room for new villagers. I've been busily working my island, filling every quadrant with farms, crafting areas with laid out, organized supplies, surplus of fish and shells, furniture arranged in cute little areas, grottos and meadows, decorative flowers as well as areas devoted to crossbreeding, I've carefully placed every single tree... And then my brother wants to play. I'd love for him to. Well, can't bc I've set my whole island. Also crappy that another player can come in and just put their house wherever, with the option of deleting whatever is in that area. Also a dumb choice with the nook mile quests. Chip down a tree. Plant a tree. Plant flowers. Etc. I want my island to be my own. At least in previous games you had the choice of swapping memory cards or cartridges. Huge disappointment and just looks money grubby on Nintendo part. Want your own island? Buy another switch! Yeah right/enjoy the negative reviews from angry consumers, Nintendo."
goldenblue,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"Amazing, soothing, charming. Every element of this game makes me happy, and every little task (even the ones that need to be done every day) is fun or interesting! It’s definitely a rewarding game, and much needed with the current state of the world."

Zuchary,"Mar 25, 2020",1,"The product shipped broken. Starting the game with a different family member will load the save file of the person who started the game for the first time. This problem doesn't exist with other games on my Switch. I don't believe this issue will be fixed any faster than the Mario Maker's multiplayer problem (which still exist). I will update this review if things improve.
If the game worked, it would be a fantastic game to get the family during this whole quarentine event."
CrybabyClown,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Everything I've ever wanted from an Animal Crossing game. This island is my own, through and through. Yes it is a shame there's only one island per console, but that does not take  this game from a 9 to a 1."
L3gion619,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"The first person to play the game becomes the mayor, and anyone else in your house who plays it is completely gimped as far as what they can do in the game. And you cant play on separate islands either unless you buy a second Nintendo Switch. So I play with both my kids and It just makes it really frustrating.

Also, breakable tools and a crafting system, really?? Animal Crossing was such a great game before they tried to turn in into Minecraft"
Faptrap,"Mar 25, 2020",0,"This is a good game but i cant play it because I have to wait for my GF who is casual to unlock things. This game is amazing for anyone who is playing SOLO i repeat playing SOLO. Do not get this if you share a console as only ONE person can play the FULL game.  I hope so much that Nintendo retracts this choice as it is not going to convince me to buy another console. The game is really good but not worth spending 200-300 more dollars just to be able to have 2 people play with FULL ACCESS. Many people already know that the first account on the switch to start the game is the ""Resident Representative"" of the Island and they are the only person who can advance the story, buildings, and citizens of the town. Any player/account who starts the game of the switch after that first player can only gather resources and upgrade there own house and characters appearance and size and can only get blueprints and items that the FIRST PLAYER has unlocked first. This was super disappointing to find out and I really hope they change this."
Darciukas,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing is an experience which is definitely not for everyone. The game has charming graphics and calming sound effects, music. The gameplay is amazing and from what I have seen this is in my opinion the best Animal Crossing game. I would give this a 10/10 if didn't handle save file recovery like this. I really wish that I could back up my saves to the cloud so if I lost my Switch I wouldn't need to hope that Nintendo accepts my one time save file recovery proposal. I haven't lost my Switch once, but I really don't wanna risk it. I see a lot of people giving this game awful reviews just because you can only have one island per console. Grow up. I understand that some people might want more consoles if their entire family plays on the console, but please don't give the game 1/10 reviews only for that. As this is my first Animal Crossing game I can surely say that it is 100% worth the price! But just keep in mind that it's not for everyone."

Artificially restricting others users on the same Switch from creating their own world and enjoy the game to the fullest is a deal breaker. I hope they fix this soon. What a shame!
bearsss,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"The game is great. I was an avid player of New Leaf, and this game is an improvement in most ways.

The graphics are amazing. I actually love taking pictures in my little town because of how pretty the water is and how nicely my character is rendered. Catching critters and chopping trees feels the same as New Leaf, which is to say, good. I really appreciate the ability to choose where the other villagers live and being able to place furniture outside. Overall it's a very strong addition to the series.

That being said, I hate that the tools can break now. It's pretty annoying when you're in the middle of a long spree of fishing or catching bugs and your tool breaks in the middle of it. I hate tool durability in general, but in a game that's supposed to just be about chilling out and having fun, this feels more like a chore. The crafting system as a whole is sort of meh to me, and I'm sure I won't like it more as my playthrough goes on.

Overall I'm giving this game a ten purely because Animal Crossing is always going to be one of my favorite comfort games, and New Horizons is an amazing update to the franchise."

Teacol,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"I'll admit, I'm not the best person to ask for a review of this game, but that's only because I haven't gotten to play this game because of Nintendo forcing players to only have one island per console.

For some quick context, my twin brother bought this game for our birthday and began playing immediately at launch. I watched him play here and there and became interested seeing as neither he or I had ever played an Animal Crossing game before but we both had only heard good things about the series. I decided to let my brother play for a few days on his own before starting up my own save. When I did, I gathered my parents and had them watch me as I figured they too would probably enjoy the game and I wanted to introduce it to them with me so we could have a new bonding experience. To my dismay however, I was able to create my own villager, but not my own island.

My brother has done nothing but tell me how much fun the game is, with my friends and the Internet echoing his praises. And yet unless I decide to fork over an extra $360 to purchase a new switch and copy of the game, I will be locked out of this game's full experience.

While this may seem like a bold claim to some, when you have a game centered around a small island, and then make players share that one island per console, you are essentially making them share a save file. Maybe I wouldn't be so upset about this fact if it wasn't common for every other game on the switch to allow multiple save files per console account.

I have heard the argument that this has always been a feature in the animal crossing series, to which I say, look at Pokemon. When Pokemon transitioned to the switch, they dropped having only one save per device, and people are now able to experience the newest Pokemon games with multiple saves. I don't see any logical reason why Animal Crossing is unable to make the same transition.

I'd also like to bring up the argument of target demographics. While it is true that the Animal Crossing series has always been able to connect with a wide audience and demographic, which is what makes the series so great I'm told, I still imagine that the target audience of this game series is children, seeing as the game contains a cute cartoony art style and is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB, allowing children to also experience the game. I can't imagine the arguments going on in households that contain multiple children right now over who gets to play on the island and who gets to do what on the island.

The bottom line here is that Nintendo is shooting themselves in the foot by not including multiple islands as this both angers old fans and limits the amount of new players able to experience the game. The hardware is clearly there, seeing as every other game on the Switch allows multiple saves across Switch accounts, including old games that didn't before moving to the Switch like Pokemon.

At the beginning of this review I said I'm not the best reviewer of this game seeing as I've been unable to play it. But for that reason alone, I'm rating this game 1 out of 10. I can see no logic in this choice of only allowing one island per console. I was really excited to try this series out for the first time, only to have that excitement squashed due to Nintendo limiting it's player base for this new game. I don't doubt the game is good, I just wish I could play it along with everyone else."
Tomatodad,"Mar 24, 2020",5,I have pretty neutral feelings about the game it looks amazing and definitely feels like an animal crossing game but im really disappointed with how poorly designed the multiplayer system was i have tried to play with my brother and only the leader can actually do things player 2 can't even get an axe plus you have to share an island with everyone on that one switch it really seems like Nintendo is trying to get everyone in the household to own a switch I dont think that's fair to do especially as it was advertised very weirdly and basically no one knew what they were trying to say. My second issue is the fact that you have to buy the Nintendo online service to invite people on other switches to your island and to use the QR code clothing system i know it's not a main part of the game and you can still go through the game without it but im just disappointed in Nintendo for even putting a paywall behind online interactions.

In order to access all the features advertised as being included in the game you are required to buy an extra Switch for every person in the household and a new copy of the game for each of them. I shouldn't have to spend an extra $1000 just to be able to play the game I already paid for.
MariaBee,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"I’m not sure if the majority of the people giving a zero rating for being unable to have more than one island per switch have ever played Animal crossing before but it’s always been that way. It seems a little harsh to completely bash the game because you don’t know it’s history and made your own assumptions. Aside from that, I did feel that the tools breaking is more than inconvenient, and I also wish you could work your way up to getting a tool that is unbreakable."
Oldskoolberk,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"I know about the rating bombing of Animal Crossing and yes the online issue is **** issue.

But this is a guilty pleasure.  So there isn't a MAIN directive of the game but none of them are really.  It's a an awesome game if you overlook the internet flaw."
Haymagay,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Everything I've ever wanted for animal crossing, started playing city folk back on the Wii. It is a dream to play, exactly what it is meant to be. 10/10"
Rosesinclover,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I've been looking forward to this game for a long time. I'm not too fussed about the one island per switch thing. It keeps the game true to it's original. I remember when you could only have one house per game, and only four players.  Such an improvement; now we can have 8 players and 8 houses? Awesome!  Looking forward to the seasonal events and setting up my little village"
DrJames,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Fantastic game with great graphics and constant fun and things to do. First Animal Crossing game with a small plot/storyline. Very entertaining. Personally I do not mind the multiplayer feature and I am okay with being limited to one island per console. If you don’t mind sharing, this game is perfect. Absolutely everything that an Animal Crossing game should be, packed with cool features, pristine graphics and great fun."
LightningMaeda,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"People need to get over themselves. Does it **** that it is one island per switch? Yes, but it has been that way since the FIRST GAME. One town per memory card. Convenient people forget that huh? The game is fine, a new twist on the formula."
babbler1202,"Mar 24, 2020",9,Loving it so far. My husband and I are playing together. Admittedly we were a bit stumped at first about only having one island but it's been fun anyway. We keep leaving each other gifts and sending cute mail. It's probably the most romantic we've been in a bit lol. Still a little confused about how you play online with friends. I want to visit their islands but I think that might cost extra and that is a little shady. But the gameplay is super relaxing and enjoyable. The customization options are awesome. It's so cute. I'm honestly spending way more time on it than I expected. A little obsessed lol.
ThunderN13,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"El juegos es muy divertido. el mejor de la saga, eh jugado ya 5 días a este juego y me siento muy satisfecho. lo malo es que solo se puede una isla por switch, pero después todos esta muy bien."
SpinaXIV,"Mar 24, 2020",0,One game per console **** Nintendo im not buying a second Switch just so I can have another save
Flabbyninja,"Mar 24, 2020",9,This game is VERY good. Relaxing gameplay and is a nice break from higher paced games for me
Antob,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"После любимой игры на 3DS, эта стала ещё удобнее, красивее, богаче и интереснее.
Локализация и возможность играть на телевизоре позволяют мне поставить игре
максимальную оценку."
Locodays,"Mar 24, 2020",0,My roommate bought this game for us to play on my switch. I let her play first on the primary account and I just spent the past few hours playing on a second account. I can’t progress the island at all leaving me hardly anything to do after just starting the game. I’ve lost all interest in playing the game already.
AustinFriend,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Seems like people are hating on a Nintendo exclusive game again. This is the perfect game of you just want to vibe. Sure, you have to put in a little time before you can fully experience the game, but I think that adds to the experience. I love this game. Not only that, but it came at the perfect time."
Hajo,"Mar 24, 2020",0,The island locking honestly broke the entire experience for me and my entire family. Very disappointed with Nintendo.
Grimesly,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"It hides the fact that only the first player actually is a full player from you. Ruining some major features.  Fix this ****, and it'll be a great game."
Megakrage,"Mar 24, 2020",10,the review bombers have 0 lives. the game is great. the best animal crossing yet. no its not a crazy adventure or anything like that. its just a nice relaxing game where you take care and build up an island with animal friends. it doesn't advertise itself as any more then that. so if you are disappointed then you are delusional. especially with this one since it has made so many improvements and more reasons to keep playing.
Mr_Alaskan,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I would love to rate this game higher as the content you can do is perfect for relaxing and such when you're able to. But being the second person in this game means that you are heavily restricted on what you can do and your progress is limited to how far the first person gets on their own. I can live with having only one island per switch, but not being able to do everything because I signed in second is just disgraceful, I either have to live with not being able to do everything or have to buy a whole second switch. It would be so easy to let the second or more players to do things like build bridges or to place resident houses, but I will never be able to unless I reset the whole game just to make me the main character. If they fix this then I would totally recommend this game, but until then I say don't give Nintendo your money."
Reeselover3,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Game is fantastic, the graphics, music , museum is beautiful, crafting system is fun, **** one island per console but I always found animal crossing to be a single player game anyways. But doesnt justify a rating of 0. Good portion of people who complain is that they want to have more than one island to have different themes .. not all complaints are  from families."
wtfNintendo,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"My kids share a switch.  I have my own and didn't want to fight with them over who got to play so we bought 2 copies of the game (digital download for mine, physical cartridge for the kids) and my kids both contributed towards 1/3 of the cost.  And now we find out they can't have separate files or have their own island?!!!  My son is devastated, we're all stuck in the house together because of the pandemic and he's too young to understand corporate greed is why he can't play a game he had to contribute a significant amount of his allowance towards.  I've been a loyal Nintendo consumer for almost 40 years and this is the thing that's going to drive me to Playstation/Xbox in the future.  I won't buy another Nintendo game unless they fix this ridiculous mess."
Animalcrossing4,"Mar 24, 2020",10,This games really fun to play solo and I recommend getting it if you haven't already got it
Mike_NLN,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"If you've ever played any of the previous Animal Crossing games you know what you're in store for. Cute animals, rewarding milestones, and tons of collectable furniture. The objectives and rules can be nebulous at times, but that is classic Nintendo. The only downer is how cluncky the multiplayer is. Everything stops and everyone is treated to a loading screen  whenever another player joins or leaves an island."
Ghosttraveler,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"11/10. I’ve played this since 2008/2009. Amazing and unique game. The characters are too cute, the customization is great, and it feels good to just vibe.  It’s a shame a bunch of babies had to ruin the score to get a point(?) across. Maybe if they pulled some weeds they’d feel better."
NativeEyes,"Mar 24, 2020",10,I love this game and its so fun and it's even better seeing it on your TV. The people who are complaining about this game only having one island for one switch. It's like that on new leaf too.  Stop your complaining and go buy another switch for all the people in your family.  I'm gonna enjoy every minute of this game as well as all the nice graphics and playing with my friends.
StevieStrange,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"One of the best games I've ever played in my life on any console. If you disagree, you are incorrect and live a dismal and soulless life."
DarkenedHill,"Mar 24, 2020",9,This game is the best in the series by far but the multiplayer is a problem. I do believe that it should be one island per cartridge at the least and not one island per switch. Don't even bother with the local multiplayer. Other than that this game is near perfect.
PapiDodo,"Mar 24, 2020",4,"No, no, **** no.

The most boring, overrated annoying game. Imagine if you will that you pay 60 dollars for a game where you run around collecting sticks and **** and then have to wait till the next day till you can do anything remotely interesting. Multiplayer is a nightmare to set up. What kind of game makes you wait days to weeks to be able to do 'fun' things. People keep mentioning that you build relationships with the villagers, well that's the biggest piece of whale **** i have ever heard in my life. If i read what I just told you to anyone else but didn't mention the name ""animal crossing"" you'd think that this was one of those ads you see for mobile games. You are paying 60 dollars for a **** mobile game. I will admit as far as I saw there was no micro-transactions.

I have a little sister who also plays the game. Well to my realization since she is player 1, she basically in control of the progress and I am left to do whatever the **** till she progresses things forward. I cannot make my own island. What kind of backward thinking is that? Mindless drones will tell you that the other games have always been this way. This is **** 2020, there's absolutely no excuse to enforce this. It doesn't cost them extra money, extra resources or extra thinking to get rid of this bull****. In fact, it probably costed them time and resources TO MAKE IT WORK LIKE THAT. It's a clear attempt by Nintendo to force the purchase of a second switch along with a game cartridge. Absolutely disgusting and not in the least bit warranted for what is a ****ty mobile game.

Do yourself a favor and do not buy this game. I promise no matter what reviewers will tell you, its all bull****. Do you really wanna sit for 3 hours collecting sea shells and wood to sell. All that just to achieve absolutely nothing?

I recommend you try **** Valley instead. The characters have far more depth. There's a story to tell. The characters you meet are not all generic furry fetish toys who apparently all need to work out (talking about the **** weird rat, ace)."
Illuluminati,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Graphics like this in 2020? Not acceptable.
Plus all the anti consumer stuff is just the icing on the cake, trash."
BenCalano,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"The best ever. Those who are saying that the crafting system and breakable tools just want instant gratification. That is not the main point of the game!!!

The BEST EVER"
Persona2Anime,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"The game ****. No interesting gameplay nor style, the game doesn't offer much at like with new leaf. You're better off just playing the original."
Splicex,"Mar 24, 2020",0,This is an incredible game for the first user to make a character. Anyone else who plans on playing only gets part of the action. Players 1 makes all of the decisions while everyone else has to wait on player 1. If player 1 isn't very active.... well too bad for everyone else. You must buy another switch for each person if they don't want to be treated as 2nd class. My family is so disappointed. We knew one island per switch was coming and we accepted that but the hamstringing of everyone but player 1 really kills the vibe. It also puts undue pressure on player 1 to make progress or feel guilty for holding everyone else back. Families don't need a game causing stress like that. We could just play monopoly or mario party if we want to have hard feelings with each other.
Plonk,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Really disappointed that I can’t have my own island. What’s worse is that the role of player 2 is so constrained that I essentially am not able to experience the game at all. This design choice will certainly make me more skeptical of future Nintendo products.
De4dlyk1tt3n,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"I think this might just be one of the best Animal Crossings yet. I know there is a lot of flack for the one island thing but I don't think that learning how to share and not be a jerk is a bad thing, Ultimately there is a lot to do and collect and the multiplayer functions are neat. I just wish you could go to random islands with friends. it would make the grinding a lot more fun, also the length of the in game chat message sometimes seems too short."
11_11,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Both me and my little sister were excited for this game and I payed 80$ to find out there’s only one island per console. This Is infuriatingly stupid that a console with the ability to have multiple accounts and games where separate accounts have their own personal saves can’t have separate games when switching accounts. Playing on someone’s else’s island takes all the fun out of the game so now I don’t want to play a game that I spent 80$ on. Not everybody has enough money to buy multiple switch’s; one purchase per household should be enough forcing families to buy multiple consoles is extremely greedy it seems those corporate **** at Nintendo are showing their true Colours
Aj742254,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Will not be playing, or coerced into bending over and taking $360 in the gyroid. Fix the ""one island"" bs. Selfish nintendo. We buy you for our kids. You're like the nanny that beats your children and steals from you while you're at work. UPDATES REQUIRED!"
squeakanine,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Have played every Animal Crossing game that's come out, and this one is absolutely the best. Looks great, lots of fun already, and with updates coming to add even more!"
Bean120,"Mar 24, 2020",10,It's really relaxing and helps my anxiety the only downside is that progression is locked behind the first player to boot up the game but as long as that first player is invested in the game then it's really a very minor problem that's easily fixed and not the game breaking thing the other review ers say it it
The1hd,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"An amazing game as always Nintendo! Don’t let the review bombers get to you, this is a must have for the Nintendo switch"
Gek98,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"L'impossibilità di creare più di un'isola per console rende sostanzialmente impossibile giocare al gioco a più di una persona per console. E questo è veramente grave per le famiglie, come la mia, all'interno delle quali la switch è condivisa da più persone. Siccome la switch viene pubblicizzata come console da famiglia trovo veramente assurda e poco professionale questa scelta e pretendo venga corretta il prima possibile con una patch. In quel caso provvederò a correggere la mia recensione e a dare il giusto voto a questo gioco, che è certamente più che ottimo."
JuniKava,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I’ve been playing AC games since the very first one came out and I’ve never been disappointed. But NH has gone above and beyond any expectations I had. I’ve been playing non stop since I downloaded it at midnight release and so have my friends. I’m excited to see what new seasons bring, events, and other things. I think Nintendo nailed Pocket Camp (the animal crossing phone app) and if this full fledged game continues on that success, which I believe it will, then this will be something to play for a long long time!"
Dfunky1,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Bought a Switch and this game for 2 kids who will be spending a lot of time at home for the foreseeable future.  Can only have 1 island???  Very disappointed.
Nintendok,"Mar 24, 2020",3,"Only one island per switch? Me and my girlfriend were really looking forward to playing, game is ok but I'm not paying 300 on a new switch to get another island."
AR15_Hallpass,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I'd like to be clear before I go any further, I have not played this game myself. I have only seen, roughly, ten minutes of gameplay over my girlfriends shoulder. Periodically, I check to see what it is she's giggling at, or smiling uncontrollably about. Those reasons alone, warrant a ten in my book, but my girlfriends enjoyment aren't the only reasons why I give this game a ten. I give this game a ten because, for the first time in a long time, it's quiet. My girlfriend is happy, amused, and distracted; all the while, I am free to my heart's content. Thank you Animal Crossing, so **** much."
devinm5821,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Love this game!! Sorry to all the people who didn't do their research before they purchased the game and are mad about the single sole console multiplayer options, but this game is still incredible. There is so much to do and so many goals to achieve, it makes me so excited for the future of the game."
slabrockfist,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"I've been excited for this game since the first Nintendo Direct that announced it, but I started up Doom Eternal first and handed the Switch off to my wife so she could play AC. She has maybe a dozen or more hours on it now, and I'm done with Doom Eternal, only to find out I can't have my own island and my progress is limited by her. I'm disappointed enough that I might use the term heartbroken to describe how I feel. The decision Nintendo made to do this is almost infuriating and there's no way I'm buying a separate console to play one game. I'm giving this 1 star because my wife seems to be enjoying it. I guess I'll have to wait another few years till she's bored of it and doesn't mind me wiping her savesave to finally get to play it. What a tremendous waste of money."
Cutsupreme1,"Mar 24, 2020",10,I have played evey animal crossing going back to the game cube and this game out shines them all
MerelyAGhost,"Mar 24, 2020",9,I love this game with a passion and I am so glad it is finally back! Almost everything about the game is amazing. I said almost. The single island per console limit is quite annoying since anyone other than first resident cannot do much other than get bells and build a house.
Mrfanguy,"Mar 24, 2020",10,This game its minor flaws but the experience of playing AC has never been this great. Amazing game overall.
WJE,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"The couch coop is awful. Absolutely awful. The inability to access your pocket, having to scroll through aaallllll your tools. No option for split screen and being forced to follow player 1. Not being able to talk to villagers or participate in any activities. It’s just straight up bad. I find playing as player 2 to be worse than just watching someone play.

My other issue (and this one is huge, in my opinion) is the limitations placed on each console. The fact that it is not only 1 island per console, but that’s it’s only one primary player per console is ridiculous. I’ve heard people argue that this is the same as what they did with new leaf... it’s not. The switch is a $400 FAMILY console. It has numerous games marketed to families and groups. It is NOT reasonable to expect people to spend $300-400 on a second (and third, or fourth) console PLUS the additional costs of $90 per game just so everyone in a household can have the same experience.

Nintendo screwed up. The single player content is amazing, but the absolute fail when more than one person in a household wants to play all but ruins the entire game for me."
Nico0,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Sinceramente en comparación con otras sagas el juego ha renovado en muchas cosas, me encanta la jugabilidad y es muy bonito."
RevenantFallout,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"News flash! You'll have no fun if anyone else in your household wants to play this besides you. They seriously pulled the dumbest, greediest looking move ever. They made it so you can only have 1 island per SWITCH CONSOLE! doesn't matter if you have different profiles or not, doesn't matter that you bought a game you own. No one island per smitch. THATS Such BS. Theyve lost many sales from myself and family because this a poor decision, worse than loot boxes in star wars.

Nothing else matters, Becca's this restriction exist."
Divergente98,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"El juego es genial de verdad. He tenido que venir hasta aquí solo para darle la nota que se merce porque he visto la gente que le está dando una nota no merecida y poco justificada. El juego me ha sorprendido gratamente en TODOS los aspectos. Su punto débil sería el multijugador, pero al poder jugar tantas personas a la vez, se lo paso"
Aliciander,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Absolutely amazing! All the customizing is so fun and the graphics are so cute!!
Beardslyrob,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I have been playing Animal Crossing since it came out on the GameCube and I was 9 years old. I’ve played Wild World on the Nintendo DS, City Folk on Wii, and New Leaf, but New Horizons throws it out of the water! What an amazing game! The attention to detail in every aspect is tremendous! It’s truly a master piece. I do not understand the negative reviews based on not being able to have more than one island per switch. If you are a fan, or new to the series you love the game all the same! Don’t let the naysayers Sway you away."
Breadsticks,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I absolutely love this game, from the anouncement to the releace of the game. I have sunk many hours into this game making me always come back for more. The daily tasks that nook miles + brings makes it all worth the while."

jamesarc,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"You can only create one island per Switch!

Do not buy this if you have multiple players in your house planning to play the game. Was excited to share this game with spouse, so disappointed to learn that we need to buy another Switch and another copy of the game to play together. Greedy-ass decision, Nintendo."
kmn483,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Only allowed 1 file per switch. An absolute slap in the face for a family system. Want to clear the trees of fruit in the morning? Anyone who plays in the evening can't pick fruit. Want to plant flowers around your house? Your little brother can remove em any time. Gonna play for several months but your sibling only wants to try it out? Their tent is there perm. Absolutely garbage.
branbran,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"The arbitrary limitation to allow only one island, and essentially, only one save file, is an incredibly anti-consumer move that limits the potential of this game. It incentivises and requires those who want to have a complete experience of the game to buy a new Switch system, or become side-lined while the first account (player) to start the game gains the special privilege as the island leader, and all the benefits that come with that. Of course, this only poses a problem if you are sharing the Switch system, or want to play with your loved ones while having an equal experience. An ironic punishment considering the nature of family-orientated Nintendo gaming systems. This does not even include cloud saving restrictions, of which New Horizons is not supported."
Medix94,"Mar 24, 2020",10,This is the game I go to when i want to relax. I enjoyed the previous games in the series and love the new additions to the game. This is a game you need to be willing to play year round but casually to enjoy the seasonal changes and new fauna. The open sandbox lay out let's you not feel rushed and enjoy your time making your village.
Programmedalex,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"I'm honestly quite in love with the game, especially due to the current circumstances keeping everyone at home. It's a great new addition to the series, adding in an interesting crafting system along with a lovely rewards program right off the bat. While I do wish I could have my own island on the shared system I use, I understand it's in the same style as how animal crossing has been done in the past. It would be terrific if they added multiple islands as a possible update, but it doesn't make or break the game. The resources for the crafting system do feel slightly iffy,  as rocks seem to only spawn once per day and it takes fruit two days to reappear.  However the game is a yet again a terrific addition to the series and I look forward to all the futures events within it!"
Podytoo,"Mar 24, 2020",0,One island per Switch is such a greedy money grab. 0/10 you can do better than this.
Peppermintsneez,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"As a secondary island member, it is hard to rate this game more than a 1. This is my first time playing an Animal Crossing game. My spouse played first, establishing himself as the island representative. I quickly realized that this meant I have no ability to make any decisions about the island. Thankfully my spouse asks for my input when placing houses, musuem, etc..  But then I realized he also gets access to diy recipes that I don't and that the island doesn't progress if he doesn't progress it. I can't contribute to the building off houses! We have no problems sharing resources. We have divided the island in half and have been sharing... But I feel like I'm getting a watered down version of the game. I don't think I should have to buy a whole other switch just so I cna have my own island! It seems ridiculous and unfair. I can't even imagine having a family with children who all want to play. How do you decide who gets to be the decision maker? I am sad because I love the game, but I feel disappointed that I don't get to experience it in full because I'm not the primary player."
Schmeckles,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Couldn’t have come out in a more perfect time. Really enjoy playing it with the family.
appleboxes,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I want to rate this game an 8 or a 9. Nintendo got so many things right. But they've completely ruined it. By not allowing proper couch coop (seriously, I can't be Best Friends with my WIFE, sitting NEXT to me, playing on the same console?) I guess I could get over that. But I can't even make my own island. They want us to buy a whole ass second Switch. Oh, and another copy of the game if we want to play together at the same time. Unacceptable. This game has made me truly furious. We were SO excited to play this and run around together and, you know, actually play the game. Compare our islands. Visit each other's islands. Play together on the same island. But we can't do ANY of that. Beyond frustrating. This is a cash grab worse than I've seen in a long time. Truly disappointing how Nintendo has completely ruined this game for so many people. They've lost a lifetime Nintendo fan. And I've had every console since the original NES. I will never again give them any of my money. Truly heartbreaking."
Leunam,"Mar 24, 2020",10,This is my first animal crossing game due to the fact that it's the first that interested me. The single player offerings and online multiplayer and almost flawlessly executed. Online joining could be smoothed out a little. The fact that you can only have one island per switch is forcing people to not do local co-op  play if they want a private island. I personally think this game is a 8.5-9 rating but since people are giving zeroes due to the the single island and online issues I give it a ten to try and help balance out the scores.
Richsince95,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"This game is fantastic so far. New Horizons gives a stronger, better sense of progression and accomplishment than any previous Animal Crossing game. While the player character essentially starts from scratch on a deserted island, there is no shortage of things to do even within the first week. Villagers are as charismatic as ever, and the catalogue of fish and bugs to catch, fossils to discover, items to craft, and Nookmiles rewards to earn is astounding. Only a few days in, my wife and I have had multiple chance-encounters with special NPCs that add a sense of intrigue and wonder to the game. As a cherry on top, the game is also beautiful; the aesthetics, soundtrack, and sound-design make for a soothing and satisfying experience.

I personally think the co-op play is great. My wife and I inhabiting the same island is not an issue, and in fact we enjoy working together and surprising one another with our creative ideas and discoveries. While it would be nice if we both had all the freedoms that the ""leader"" position offers at once, it is so quick and easy to switch leaders that we have no problem tag-teaming whatever we're working on. If I could ask for one thing, I would a split-screen co-op feature. However, the current system serves well in its own rite.

I'm very excited to continue playing New Horizons, developing our island, and making new discoveries. I appreciate the hard work that's gone into this game, and I'm thankful in advance for the content updates that will continue to make this game an exciting and enjoyable experience. Thanks, Nintendo!"
Saucetin,"Mar 24, 2020",1,Nintendo has made it impossible for you to creat multiple islands on a single Switch console in a nasty attempt to get people to purchase more consoles. This completely ruins the game for me and many other long-time fans of the series.
shopme,"Mar 24, 2020",6,"For me, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year. As a single-player experience, I'd say going around and improving your island is relaxing and addicting. The Nook Miles system brings me back to the game everyday to try to save up for new rewards. The new crafting system also keeps me coming back to collect more materials. Even with all of this, there's one huge issue that cannot be ignored that many others have complained about.

Animal Crossing fails the most at co-op. The fact that you can only have one island per Switch seems greedy, so that customers go out to buy more switches. Even if you buy another copy of the game, it won't give you another island. That means me and my siblings are forced to live on one island. The leader and follower system can very annoying to deal with, especially if you really want to get things done on your island. The leader retains all of the abilities a regular player would have, but the followers are basically glorified NPCs. The followers can't access their inventory or interact with other residents. Followers can only use their tools and pick things up. When they do pick something up, it goes straight to the recycling bin, for the leader to potentially steal, or for a drawn out sequence where the players have to switch between leaders. It doesn't help that sometimes my siblings sometimes try to cuck me and steal my resources to sell, or for one of them to steal leader from me. It's also annoying that you can shake your controller to change leader. My siblings just shake my hands and steal leader. I'd really like an option to turn that off. I don't get why they locked these features to just one player. It really waters down the experience for me who was excited, since I'll be playing mostly co-op with my siblings.

The biggest flaw with co-op play, the thing that really kills the experience for me, has to be the Island Representative system. There can only be one Island Representative, the person who first opens the game. They are also the only person who is able to progress the story, along with other exclusive benefits like exclusive DIY recipes. That would be fine if there was multiple save files, but the problem is there isn't. The other players that live on the island just have have a way worse experience. I'm not saying it's not fun to play as a villager, I'm just saying you're not getting the full experience. It can still be fun to decorate your house and to complete daily tasks.

I think this game is at its best when playing single-player. Co-op at the moment is terrible and not having extra saves can ruin the experience for many. Also, please keep in mind I don't have access to a single-player save. I'd recommend this game to people to people who have Switches that only they use. This game just isn't made for multiple people to with. Even if my siblings did cooperate with me, the game would still be 6."

Julian0505,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Didn’t plan on making a review but am doing my part to protect this masterpiece from review bombing. This game is wonderful, have played for around 25 hours over the last few days and collecting resources to upgrade the island and design your house is great. If you wanted multiplayer then I’m sorry but Animal Crossing has always been mostly single player, not sure what you were expecting. Buy it, I beg you."
Init,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Nintendo did this to themselves. Noone should need to buy a new console just to have another save state on a game. It would be a 10 if they thought of the customer for once.
realtalkjr,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I don’t like to give unreasonable ratings to games but I hope Nintendo realizes that they made a mistake forcing people to buy multiple switches in order to play this game with their friends.  I spent $60 on this game to escape the resource-sharing nightmare of being quarantined with 4 people in my household indefinitely.  I expected the peace and tranquility of my own island, and the fun of sharing that island with *visitors*, hoping my housemates would start their own islands on our shared switch. The second day with this game I learned that is not an option. Not only are my housemates forced to share the same island with me, the resources on my island are shared between all of us.  Anybody can move anything outside of their houses anywhere on the island. Playing local coop is completely brain dead for the second player, like bad enough that an intelligent child would get bored of it instantly. My experience with this game went from a peaceful private getaway to a mirror of the frustrating situation of being trapped in a too-small space with too many people indefinitely.  If there was ever a game that can reproduce the annoyance and fatigue of sharing an apartment with 4 other people in viral quarantine, it’s this game.  If you have one switch and multiple people who want to play this game, don’t bother.  I really want to play it, I really want to like it, there are so many things about it that seem great for a single person to enjoy, but the multiplayer mechanics have made it impossible for me to appreciate these things. I would have paid $60 to avoid the disappointment and frustration this game has made me feel.  Anyways... bad move Nintendo, I really don’t understand the thought here unless it was a financial one. Please learn from this mistake."
Davemarco,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Just found out that I can't actually enjoy any of this game's features, simply because my wife logged in first. This is the worst game design ever - fix this Nintendo!"
Justforhowbadur,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Nintendo is the Disney of video games. They are incredibly greedy and refuse to work with their fan-base. One island PER SWITCH? No. Money grubbing and asinine. If you're looking for another reason not to buy it, loading times in multiplayer are absurd. Every single time someone comes to/leaves from an island, everyone gets a 90 second loading screen."
RoastedOtter,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Very upset that Nintendo took a page out of EA’s book. Very disappointed that only the first user per switch to open the game has full control of the SINGLE island on the switch. Such a money grab. Just allow everyone to have their own separate game and island.
Raven11229,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"While it is indeed sad you're limited to one islsnd per console, i think it's weird that people are rating this game 0/10. Really? Are you guys so sad that because a game doesn't have a popular feature, it deserves to be review-bombed? In any case, that just proves it's success. A mediocre game wouldn't get review-bombed.

Space7007,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Really wanted to enjoy this game with my family but the one island per console is extremely limiting. The real spoiler is that only the first person to play (the island leader) is the only one who can advance the game for everyone else. If you live alone or are the only one who plans to play on the switch this is a non-issue. For those who plan to play with family or friends on the same switch it is extremely limiting factor and makes progress dependent on the first one who played.
lordgerben,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE PLANNING TO PLAY ON ONE SWITCH.
If you do, there goes $60 down the drain. Only 1 island is allowed to be created per Switch, and if another player on the same Switch wants to play, they'll be a glorified visitor on the island, unable to make any decisions for the island, being restricted to do essentially nothing but build their own home. The game either needs to make the option of making multiple islands or give everyone on an island the option to be in control. My sister made an account first and unless I pay another $300 for a new Switch, I can't play the game. Such a disappointment, would rather have gotten DOOM."
no1interesting,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I want to give this game a good review. I really do. However, the one island per console thing just kills the game for me. I was totally ok with sharing an island with my spouse, but we don't share the island. Everyone who starts the game after the first person is a glorified visitor.  I realize this was a thing in older animal crossing games, but as far as I know, you could at least buy a second copy of new leaf if you wanted to have your own experience. Tying the island to the console instead of the cartridge is just ridiculous. If Nintendo decides to fix this then I will be happy to write a new glowing review. As far as I can tell if you are the only person in your household interested in playing then it's a great game. As for my score: I know a lot of people are arguing that it's unfair to review bomb because ""we're not complaining about the actual gameplay"" but i watched every official trailer and Nintendo Direct about the game. Nowhere does it say your experience may be limited if you share a console. I understand that it was like this in older games. But not all of us played the older games. To for some people, this is their first animal crossing and something this knuckleheaded can actually ruin the franchise for them. My 0 score is my plea for Nintendo to at least patch it so each unique cartridge can generate an island."
Drsenn2,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Cooperative play becomes competitive. People either have to fight to get to the console first in order to play in a manner that pushes the story forward, or you have to manipulate the time/date to be able to have the resources available to you.  Poor choices; bad call, Nintendo"
Paddycakes,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Ive been excited about New horizons for a long time. I was equally excited to share the island with my wife and enjoy what content was offered. Then I realized the limitations of being ""player 2"". While my wife gets to enjoy unlocking all the content,  getting all the resources and recipes, and learning about the game from a very nice tutorial, im left to only mess with what little repeatable content there is to do.

The only meaningful things i can do is gather resources and give them to the person who is the main character to progress their **** no longer involved in the gameplay, and pretty much cast out to do nothing other than work on my house.  This is not animal crossing to me, even if i share a console with another player i shouldnt be relegated to playing a gimped minecraft.

Forcing me to pay for another switch CONSOLE to get my own island to play is not acceptable in the least and should addressed as the most important issue IMMEDIATELY.  Until then i give a score for what its like to be player 2. There is nothing to do so its a 0"
aquadude123,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Only one island per console is scummy, but not deal breaking on its own. You can't even buy a second copy of the game, you literally have to buy a second Switch. That is more scummy than pretty much anything I've seen in gaming before.

However, despite the scummy decision, I wasn't planning on having more than one island anyways, so it's not a deal-breaker. What is a deal-breaker for me is that there's only one First Resident per island, and pretty much everything is locked off for anyone who isn't a First Resident. This, in combination the SCUMMY practice I mentioned before, is why the game deserves a 0 in its current state. I've never felt so betrayed by a company before and I bought Fallout 76."
Tayyy,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"While the one island per switch conundrum can be problematic to the game’s family audience, the game itself is phenomenal and visually beautiful. The amount of love and effort put into this game causes the environment, soundtrack, and character to pop out of the screen. The ambience is breathtaking, and the writing is some of the best in the series thus far. While Nintendo has had many problems in the past, the amount of love put into New Horizons pays off in various ways. The previously-mentioned one island per switch conundrum is just that: a problem. The restriction is not, however, a game-ruining characteristic."
Angelmamistan,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Having one island per console isn't even the worst part about this game. The fact that every other player - except the first person to boot up the game - cannot learn and perform more than 75% of the games functions is beyond UNACCEPTABLE. At this point Nintendo expects each switch console user to purchase their own switch with an additional animal crossing game if they want to play AC at the same register as the island ""resident representative"" LOL. This issue is clearly a money grabbing scheme and could easily be avoided by either 1) allowing everyone to be 'resident representative, or 2) Giving each player the OPTION to either join someone else's island on their switch OR create their own island. This function needs to be fixed as the game at this point is BROKEN, and is very disappointing for the following types of demographics: Couples who share a switch, siblings who share a switch, a parent and a child who want to play together, Roommates who all pitched in to buy a switch together.... you get my point. Hopefully it can be fixed because currently customers are very dissatisfied with the results."

Animal Crossing is a gentle life simulator and relaxation game. It's not for everybody.  That said, like each new main release in the series this one is the best Animal Crossing yet.

Disco420,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"If you plan on playing this game across multiple accounts on one switch your progress will be gated based on the progress of the 1st account to play the game on your console. This is without warning and nothing in the game advises you of this.

Chase51773,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Though advertised as multiplayer most in game actions are unnecessarily locked to the first person that starts the game. The poor design decisions include, but are not limited to:
1) There is no mechanical reason for only one person to be allowed to craft certain items. This not only applies to larger projects such bridges, but also smaller diy recipes are only gifted to the first player. 2) You canot travel to other islands or invite friends to your island while playing co-op. (Not only online functions but the in game deserted islands too.)
3) Rather than create a co-op inventory system they opted to be lazy and limit it to the leader only. Other items are teleported to a shared inventory.
4) Another minor issue with co-op is the controls for swapping tools changes depending on whether you're the leader or not. This is obviously a minor gripe, but annoying none the less. & completely  unnecessary.
5) The most annoying thing about these issues is that they're the result of poor design choices and laziness."

jagohod,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I think people are misunderstanding, most players aren't angry over the single island per system; but the fact that players 2-8 have literally 0 impact on the island.

On new leaf, pretty much all the mayor can do is add buildings or ordinances. that's it. this game excludes a large chunk out of it for the other players. i.e: terraformation.

If you're playing single player, then good for you! but stop taking other people words and distorting them."

SleepzCat,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Would be a 10 but multiplayer really wasn't handled well, and it's disappointing that you can only have one island per switch. But other than that it's a near perfect game in my opinion and it's been hard for me to out down."
BobTheCat,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"First, I do not share my switch with anyone so I do not experience the account problems listed in the Negative reviews.

As an AC veteran, this game fulfilled my wishes from when I was a 5-yr old playing the gamecube version. The game gives you so many options to live your life on the island. You have just about total control over every single thing on the island.

What a lot of people love about the AC series is that THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE. You can do literally whatever you want. You have the OPTION to fill the museum, buy every single item, buy every single piece of clothing, and even refuse to pay off your loan from Tom Nook because we all know he's greedy. That is the beauty of this series. It's not meant to be played by the traditional gamer who expects the game to end. That's why so many people have been playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf since it's release date in 2013!

It's a relaxing game filled with so much more personality than New Leaf. Just yesterday, one of my villagers was singing by the lake for 20 minutes! You can see villagers sweeping, building - my poor Biff has yet to catch a bug and gets super sad about it.

Overall: ""Enjoy the small things in life."" ""Live in the moment."" This is what Animal Crossing New Horizons means to me"
Baileywastaken,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Nintendo made this game so that only one person per console can get the full experience and it disappointing to say the least.
Marvs90s,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Suddenly everyone wants to play with more than one island on a switch, 5 hours into the game and the game is fun, relaxing and I always find something to do great game that doesn't deserve the 0 peole that maybe havent even play the game yet."
Chucklenut,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Nintendo has a knack for releasing one-of-a-kind, otherwise fantastic games that are dragged into the mud by one or two miserable 'features.' New Horizons delivers almost everything that was promised but pulls its hand back on one feature- multiplayer. While the limitation of ""one island per Switch"" was announced prior to launch the limitations forced on players not the ""island representative."" All progress on the island, such as crafting recipes, buildings, and public works are locked behind the first person to play the game on a system. Secondary players likewise do not receive anything from progressing the game's 'story' such as awarded crafting recipes, items, money, or any unique character dialogue or cutscenes tied to them, such as when completing the museum or town hall. Local multiplayer is likewise gutted, with the camera, inventory, and NPC interaction being tied exclusively to the session's ""leader."" Online multiplayer is not much better, being essentially the same as New Leaf's without its mini-game island or any equivalent, which was a good portion of the online content for that game. These make for an extremely underwhelming and downright frustrating multiplayer experience that is difficult for even the most easily entertained to enjoy, which is particularly upsetting as the game, at its core, is extremely fun and almost everything you could hope for from an Animal Crossing game.

I have my doubts Nintendo will address this issue. They have ignored other key product issues, such as Joy-Cons drifting and poor online services, to burying their head in the sand and hoping it'll blow over. I sincerely hope that they are not successful in skirting responsibility on this one- this is a decision made out of pure greed to sell more Switch systems, that thankfully, could not have been made at a worse time. I do hope Nintendo patches the game to allow multiple islands per system, or at the very least, improve the gameplay of secondary residents."
Tanker475,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"The game is awesome, but the limit of one island per console means that only one person in my family actually gets to enjoy the game in its entirety

Everyone else is limited in what they can do, and they all take a supporting role. Disappointed to be honest. The game would be perfect if each profile could choose between joining an existing island or creating their own. Unfortunately, this is the only way I can protest"
Marleysgame,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"All of the negative reviews are from people that are not familiar with the animal crossing franchise. Let me preface this by saying that in animal crossing, it was always 1 town per console from GameCube to now. Also, animal crossing never gave clear objectives because it’s a do what you want when you want kind of game - extremely casual. You can access your objectives through your nook phone though and they are laid out for you, and all are pretty much optional to complete. Honestly this is a game that long time fans of the series will love, as well as fans of the mobile game pocket camp. It’s very open and do as you wish, which animal crossing has always kind of been like that. If you like **** valley, you will probably like this game also."
isabellamarie,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"super fun game, just really unfortunate that i got it to play with my boyfriend on his switch and since i was the first person to make a character i am the only one granted to perform all of the more fun tasks that make the game what it is. in other words only the first person who makes an account gets to pick the island and where everything goes and upgrades etc... anyone else after may still love on the island but they do not get their own and do not get to complete any tasks. so if you’re planning to buy this for your kids to share, don’t. seems like nintendo just wants everyone to buy all their kids switches and guess what? more games. pathetic."
SwedishFlopper,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This is Animal Crossing! People that are complaining, just bought this game because everyone else was buying it and didn't do any research about the style of game.

It's like you bought Doom Eternal expecting there to be a deep woven narrative with heavy dialogue and character building. Actual game score 8/10."

Kirby54,"Mar 24, 2020",4,"Our household was so excited to get this game as we have played every other version of animal crossing and love the world of animal crossing. However upon learning only one person actually gets to experience the full game per switch and that there’s no option to create your own island even with a separate game purchase ruined the experience. While it’s fun and cute and new features like the Nook phone and mileage add to gameplay, the gameplay for “player 2” is severely restricted. Additional players are limited to what “player 1” has achieved, and only player 1 can advance gameplay by achieving goals to upgrade Nook’s shop or the museum. Additional players also do not get to invite new animal residents or choose where to build houses and buildings, nor do they have access to the same resources and quests as player 1. This for me is a huge gray cloud that hangs over this otherwise cute and fun addition to the franchise. Nintendo - value your fans over selling more consoles"

Torchward,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Totally time absorbing. Really has the iconic animal crossing feel with a little bit of a twist which I feel is needed as I've aged with the series. I would give this a 10 but that is only due to the island's being on the slightly smaller size to my liking as the previous versions had just a tad more breathing room. My gf and I our currently playing on our own switch and have had no issues with connecting to one another and going doing our own thing or helping each other gather resources. It is a solo based playthrough/gameplay but with the added touch of a very easily setup multiplayer system, we have enjoyed it a lot with each others company. I'm unsure how are complaints of a shared world is a problem as this is how it's always been in which individuals shared their island/continent with other family members but if this does not effect you, you will have a really great time in animal crossing."

bbdude95,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Multiplayer:
Claiming the game is ""co-op"" is basically a joke. If you aren't the first person to start the game you are essentially useless and every functionality is locked out. You have to wait for the original player to advance the story if you want anything to happen or change. Now if player one decides to take a break from the game or isn't able to play for a while you have no option but to wait for them. I hope you didn't buy this game for the sole purpose of playing multiplayer like I did.

Game content:
The island feels pretty small when you first start out. The island we chose had very little starting space. The tutorial is fairly long for how simple the mechanics are. Second player and up will progress through the opening a lot faster. The game is cute as always but fairly bland. Tldr: Multiplayer is horrible and there isn't really much to redeem the game."
PlayTop2100,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Only one island per switch makes me mad. I wanted to play the game but Nintendo said ""Naw fam""."
osokomocho,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This is a wonderful game for old fans and new fans. You also have the choice to pick your villagers later on and where they stay so certain spots you like or have set up won’t be ruined.
To the people complaining about only having one island per system, this has literally been apart of animal crossing since it’s first game it’s not new and probably having multiple save files like some other games probably would not work with the actual clock it uses which is your game system’s clock."
Scykro,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Multilayer connection takes a super long time, but it's fun and has a lot to do and that can be done. Custom patterns are intense."
BuckyMcDonuts,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Super fun game. I do question Tom Nook's predatory lending practices. I owe him more than I do my actual bank.
Maabat,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"I cannot stress enough how dumb half these reviews are. The fact that most of these reviews tunnel vision on only the ""1 island"" rule set is absurd. This is why a lot of user reviews are dismissed purely because of this.

I for one don't seem phased by this, neither do a few of my other friends. BESIDES the fact, the game's mechanics feel smooth and easygoing. I like the progress of the ""story"" is provides, and the progression of the island over time. If I were going to complain about a missing feature though, is the fact that multi-select is not a thing when it comes to putting stuff away in your home storage. Other than that, the game feels very well done in spite of all the negative reviews it has.

I feel like Nintendo will fix this just to mitigate the number of complaints people are throwing at them. But this won't stop people from attacking it from base release..."
LogManTM,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"**** that **** with the ""only one island per switch""
I literally just bought the game before I found out and now I'm stuck with it.
The game's apparently good, but **** that anticonsumer bull****. Why did you change  it instead of keeping what you had before? It was so cool when my brother and I figured out that each switch profile had a different save in BotW. That was one of the major appeals of staying on the switch. Please don't set this prescedent.
Still mainly a PC gamer, bit I really like the switch. Please don't ruin it.
And whatever bull**** article I clicked to get here, **** off. This is definitely worth a review bomb, especially because it's the only thing is consumers can do to be heard."
Thewingedkitty,"Mar 24, 2020",10,It's great! Lots to do and it isn't big thing to share an island with other players because you can also visit other people's islands.
Detty,"Mar 24, 2020",9,IF YOU DID YOUR DID RESEARCH YOU WOULD KNOW YOU CAN ONLY HAVE 1 ISLAND PER CONSOLE. Same as every other game. Don't review bomb because you can't read.
cbland,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Absolutely wonderful to play. Anyone who is negative review bombing is ignoring all of the wonderful aspects of the game- and the fact that multiplayer in this game is much more inclusive and effective than AC games in the past. I mean in New Leaf, there was only one player who could be mayor (aka only one decision maker) and I didn't see nearly the same amount of outrage. The fact of the matter is the switch is a singer player device that offers multiplayer options, and they are not obligated to do anything. Additionally, people are not being patient enough to get through the introductory period in game, after you wait through the introductory period, all characters will eventually be able to add things outside and terraform. I absolutely despise how susceptible people are to outrage culture, and how impatient people are. If you aren't patient enough to play this game, then that's on you because the nature of AC is to make progress slowly. Sorry you all weren't instantly gratified."

Leoogdom,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"This game is beautiful and plays very good. BUT here is the deal: I started playing at launch, my girlfriend started to play the day after and was having fun until we realized that she couldn't proceed in the game unless I proceeded in the game. Me, as player 1 was the real character and she was just a NPC that you can play as which completely ****. She love the franchise but can't afford a Switch but with this, Nintendo is basically saying ""Hey, do you wanna play Animal Crossing as it should be played? GET ANOTHER SWITCH YOU LITTLE *******!"". I'm really unsatisfied and even though I liked the game, this completely ruined it for me. Animal crossing should be a game that you go and relax, not a game that you play angry because only YOU can build the bridge or the store or something relevant.
New horizons is far more disappointing than Pokemon Sword/Shield, because it looks like Nintendo is becoming an EA."
AwezomeAnthony,"Mar 24, 2020",0,I was really looking forward to playing and creating my own island on the switch. My girlfriend loves Animal Crossing more than I do so I let her make an island and play the game first. Come to find out that I can't even play now because there's only 1 island. It's just very upsetting. Please fix the console situation
Masterduck,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"The inability to control what I can do with a game is the product of a bygone era. Locking island generation to the console and not the cartridge is absolute garbage. Then not restricting what the secondary players can do to improve the island and move the gameplay forward is just pure capitalist bull, which should be ironic seeing as this is a game whose very plot is outlined by a capitalist Raccoon. 1/10 would not buy again."

Mccordinator,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Game is awesome. Everyone downvoting is mad about a multiplayer issue with people living on the same island being gated  by the first player being the only one able to progress certain things forward. **** but no reason to review bomb a game. It’s been out 4 days...   Remake your island and out a first player that will progress the island instead of make everyone wait? Time skip a couple days if you need to catch back up.
UnearthIy,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"If you share a switch player 2 is completely removed from the whole game experience. Obviously a ploy to make you buy another switch. They have no say on where buildings go, miss out on all the cool diy recipes that you get when setting up new houses, and cannot progress them game on their own. This game shows that Nintendo is just as greedy as EA"
hoogie52,"Mar 24, 2020",3,"I was extremely excited to play this game. Drove all over my city trying to find it. Finally got to play it, only to discover that since my kid had started the game, I was locked out of experiencing the majority of the game. I’m now forced to start over, after managing to unlock several things. I’m beyond frustrated with it, to say the least. Shame on you Nintendo for ruining this game."
Syngirl,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Literally the only thing i dislike about this game is how quickly my tools break, forcing me to recraft them."
Jokerstotherigh,"Mar 24, 2020",0,I never leave a review but I had to say something. I was third person to start a character on our family switch so didnt understand why I could create a museum. After three days our island should have had a museum so I wanted to get started on that but soon realized that wasn't an option being the 3rd player to start the game. The 1st player is the only person able to progress the game and my daughter would rather draw pictures on the bulletin. There needs to be an update to allow the whole family to play this game and enjoy the experience.
DontchaKnow,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"My sister owns the switch and we both love Animal Crossing, but I'm not going to go buy a new switch to get the full experience of this game. Its a shame really."
Hereswaldo10,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Definitely the best iteration so far! I've only played for a few days but there is SO much to do and it really gives you all creative liberties as advertised. I haven't even made it to future portions of the game, but I'm so excited to see what this game has in store for me!


There is no strong narrative, but that's standard for AC games. Graphics are amazing, and the island feels much more alive compared to previous games.

I know there's been a lot of criticism of only one island per console, but I honestly LOVE the concept of sharing an island on the console. It makes the island feel more alive and is true to real life, that you're not the only one in the world."
dlvilla88,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Can't believe the game only allows 1 island per console. Absolutely terrible.
efejoao,"Mar 24, 2020",0,I want to play this game very much but won't pay 80 CAD / 60 USD for a limited game that I can not fully play with my husband unless I buy another console and another copy of the game. It is just too much.
Arroyo,"Mar 24, 2020",10,For all you cry babies Nintendo said ahead of release ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH! STOP your dang crying! The game is awesome. It is poop about the access that the second player in the island gets. But if you have played the other animal crossing games you don't share your town/island it never works out. And for the people time travelling complaining of lack of content my goodness take the time and enjoy the game stop trying to get everything all at once. I'm pretty sure Nintendo said there would be events happening in real life time so why skip ahead and complain
Persebunny,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"It's a great game! Finally after trying for a year, my boyfriend is heavily interested in the same game as me. As to those who complain about singular islands, the knowlege was made public months prior to release, that's your own fault. I love the formatting and the graphics, so beautiful and detailed! And certain audio files that were once piercing and screechy in previous games have been softened to a much more soothing tone. I can have someone sleeping in the same room as me with the volume up and this game will not disturb their sleep! Seriously, but this game. You can handle taking turns, it's the exact same way it was with the DS games."
Gmusca01,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Fantastico, credo che dare uno 0 come voto per una cosa mai promessa sia veramente sciocco."

If you share a switch with someone, but cannot fathom sharing an island, then just find a different game to play. From everyone I've talked to, it's clear: people who love Animal Crossing love this game."
Olivierdotwmv,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Extremely anti consumer game. Nintendo is only getting away with this because their fans accept anything from them
Nachoman22,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"This is a fantastic game. I've only had it for five days, but I'm obsessed. It's super cute and relaxing. Great for this time while I'm stuck inside."
Degion,"Mar 24, 2020",0,One island per switch makes it unplayable for me. Wish I could return the game since we know Nintendo won't change it
Filmmusictheory,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Game would be a 9/10 if it wasn’t for the single switch issue. New Leaf was still a better game and experience overall.
Akourne,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Nintendo, come on. This is the most customizable, most personalize, most progression based animal crossing game ever made. Why why why would you lock everyone into the same island? Because the last games did it? This isn't the last games. It only worked then because the towns were immutable, and progress was tracked separately. You guys completely changed how the game is played, the saves should reflect that. Fix this glaring, obvious issue, and I'll pick up the game."
StuPotField,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"great great game, haven't had so much fun in a while, me and my mom live on the same island, it's been pretty fun doing stuff together, don't mind the review bombers everyone, the game is godlike."
explodingbears,"Mar 24, 2020",3,"This review is written from someone who shares a console with other users, so the review will reflect that experience. Sharing a single island amongst several other players is seriously disappointing, and leaves much to be desired. Progression and game features are severely limited to anyone who doesn't play as the primary island inhabitant. There is no shared progression toward island milestones, and key items or crafting abilities are not distributed in the same manner, leaving an imbalanced playing experience. Players who are not the first to set foot on the island are demoted to mere scavengers of resources, with limited contribution to island development. The choice to not have separate islands for separate players, and to limit the developmental experience for players that share the island, is highly disappointing, and appears to be the greatest complaint with the game.  It became very apparent that this was a poor system wheat the point in the game where the first set of new inhabitants are joining the island and the primary player is given some dozen new crafting recipes and the objective of placing and furnishing several new homes across the island. Secondary players during this timeframe get none of the same recipes, are merely told to ""talk to the primary resident"" for instructions, and cannot contribute in any way to the progression aside from collecting raw materials like mindless robots. Not quite the shared gaming experience people are looking for. Certain choices like these made the experience feel extremely imbalanced and truly disappointing from the standpoint of someone who might not be the primary inhabitant. The only reason I could see Nintendo choosing to design the game in this way is to persuade people to have multiple consoles and copies of the game. One island per console is just not a good approach and could have been much better had single console multi-player been designed more intelligently."
Starfrighter,"Mar 24, 2020",6,"Like many people here said before: The game itself is fine BUT the way the game handles shared save files is ridiculously bad!! The worst I have ever seen in any videogame to be honest.
There is only one shared island per Switch (not cardridge - switch) and the player that happens to be the first on the island is the only one that can basically ""play"" the game! The others are considered villagers and are more like active spectators, than actual players. There is no way to interact with quests or progress in the game if you are not the one person starting the game. My GF and I wanted to share this game, instead she is playing it 95% since I can not experience or progress the story at all. Until this is fixed I hope NOONE buys this game and forces Nintendo to patch this - I really wanted to play this.. I was hyped since its announcement. This just makes me soo mad at this game."
Jensonliew,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"So looking forward to play this game with my wife but with the limited local multiplayer setup, it makes the game frustrating to play as only the main player gets to progress the story while the other player get to do nothing but sit there and wait. Nintendo even lock it so that only 1 switch can have only 1 island, wow you guys are more greddy then EA. Sorry Nintendo i will stop playing your games now, im truly and deeply saddened by you people."
MekachuDrago,"Mar 24, 2020",10,The game is absolutely fantastic and everything we have been waiting for for seven long years. The ability to truly customize your island and all of the quality of life upgrade make this game so very worth the money.

ceklewis,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Greedy tactic from Nintendo of 1 island per switch..! Completely ruined the game for me. Every other game ever made knows not to do this. Shocking.
JohnDoneth,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I had never played AC before and got it for my girlfriend so she could play it on our Switch because she loved playing New Leaf. After she stopped playing for the day I was gonna hop on and create my own island but that's when I learned that it was not possible. There is only one island per Switch console, not per user profile. Even if you do go ahead and use the same island you are completely gutted of what you can do as the second player. I could've been an Animal Crossing fan but instead I've been alienated. I wanted to have my own island and have my own experience. A pretty disappointing flaw that only seems like a cash grab from Nintendo."

It's got great features and the Nook miles are a clever way to make mini objectives so it's not just build the biggest house and fill the museum. Lot's to do!
Jojo8,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Multiplayer is a joke!!!!!!! When your family members can’t play the game on their own profile.
Ktwhatson,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"This game is a lot fun & I honestly think it's unfair that people are giving the game a bad review for something that has been the same with EVERY Animal Crossing game. It's always been one save file. I love working towards building my town, the only reason I didn't give it a full 10/10 is that  the item menu options & the touchiness of the A button when I'm near a tree can make it a little frustrating. Especially with the item menu where drop item is at the first option, I have dropped several medicines because of it   But overall it's a relaxing & fun game."

This game is not for everyone, certainly it wasn't for me i got trapped in the hyptrain that Reddit generated towards this game and the Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal cross over that happened, but man this game is BORING AS FU***.

Sure slaying demons with a shotgun might be ridiculous concept but it's fun."
Rhyno_,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I’ve been looking forward to this game for quite sometime. I bought my Switch at launch for BOTW and hopes of a new Animal Crossing game in the future. I preordered 2 copies, one for each of my kids to play on their Switch Lites, and the wife and I were going to just share on our main console. The fact that player 2 is no more than a background character to, what I have no doubt, will be a super fun experience, is complete garbage. There’s no progression through the game unless player 1 (the first resident on the island) gets multiple tasks done first, in order to progress the story.  I get they’re just trying to sell more consoles, but this is a crap way to do it. I’m not buying a 4th console just so everyone in my household can have a complete gaming experience. If you have children/roommates/spouses, and plan to share the game, rethink your purchase."

hukt_own_fonikz,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Best Animal Crossing to date. Crazy attention to detail, lots of freedom, the neighbors have more personality, even the Nooks have turned away from their life of crime and are pleasant to chat with this time around. Lots of sequenced events which feels fresh for the series, and there are lots of tasks to accomplish. If you want the game badly enough that you need your own personal island, you're much better off owning your own Switch and copy of the game. Otherwise enjoy the enhanced Party Play mode where you both get to experience the game together. Animal Crossing is a social game at heart."

GuillyAlpha,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"The game is the BEST animal crossing so far, all the new features, such as crafting and choosing where do the villagers live allows you tu personalize your entire island.

It's true that much of the features are limited to the first player, but it's the same situation that was in New Leaf, so i see it as a minor con."
CruisRad,"Mar 24, 2020",3,Game is fun to play. The one island per switch console thing is a joke in this day and age. Average game and overall good time waster.

subswitch,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"The limitation of one island per Switch (not per cartridge, per Switch) is nonsensical. It‘s obvious Nintendo is just trying to sell more Switch consoles.

Player 2 can’t make any administrative decisions. Players 1 and 2 have to share limited daily resources. I had to delete my save so my brother could enjoy the game."

Philosophile,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I would love this game if it weren't for the multiplayer.

Hope they let the series die here instead of running it into the ground further."
choochooman,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"We spent $300 on a switch for the family. $50 for this game. However unlike every other game we own on the system (Breath of the Wild, Fire Emblem, Ring Fit, Astral Chain) only 1 player in our family can get the full experience in Animal Crossing. Everyone else get's a much more butchered experience and they have less ability to effect their own game world. This kind of system does not exist in the other games we have nor is it something you see in games on other systems. Nintendo this is absolutely ridiculous that if other members of our family want the full Animal Crossing New Horizons experience they need to buy a brand new Switch system for themselves. Please fix this issue! Until Nintendo fixes this with a patch I would recommend anyone who shares their Switch system to NOT buy this game."

Alliam,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Same criticism of the game as others **** single island per switch limitation means I'll never get to play the full experience of the game as the secondary AC player in the house.

Mattonator,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"A fantastically relaxing game that is super engrossing. I recommend having other games to play while you wait for things to be built because half the fun of the game is feeling that the Island is actually alive with real events that take time. On the box of the game, it tell you how only one island is allowed per console. Review bombing the game over something that is displayed on the box, isnt a fair. Definitely hope this issue is fixed, but as someone who plays alone on my console, it's not worth ignoring how great the game is."

You can really tell how much care they put into this game with all the little details, leaves blowing in the wind and the way light hits and reflects off objects. I really enjoy the way custom designs smooth out the pixels now, as it allows for more versatile designs. The villager personalities are incredibly charming. It would take so many words to express how much I love this game, so I'm going to stop there. I've been waiting a long time for this game, and I'm so thrilled to be able to play it now. It is a good way to escape from reality during these dark times with quarantine and all that."

It has strayed from the original AC formula so much that I don't even want to play it anymore. All of the Pocket Camp integrations have been annoying and stressful; completely taking away from the game.

There's pressure to fill the residents home with furniture or else they won't move in, there's pressure to continuously build tools that break extraordinarily quickly.

And the hourly music is AWFUL!!!  I just play with my switch turned all the way down with older AC game OST playing in the background.

I'm overall so disappointed in this game that I could barely give it one star. The only thing it has going for itself is the graphics."
Maradi,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"An amazing addition to the animal crossing games. Beautiful graphics, cute characters, fishing and hunting bugs are very enjoyable. People complaining about the multiplayer and giving reviews of 0 are being arrogant and ignoring all other good aspects of the game"
CactusToast,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"If you read any of the other mixed or negative reviews on this site, you'll see many people primarily complaining about being locked to one island per switch and having content restricted if they're not their not the first person to play.

luinishida,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game really came with a huge change, compared to the previous ones, craft, the miles option, the evolution is being wonderful and has a lot to do differently from the old versions, I love it, and I hope that a dlc solves this problem of having just an island, and always bring new news and maybe an expansion! Congratulations Nintendo!

Ps: i wish i could keep things out of the house in boxes or wardrobes and not need to enter the house to save, taking the option of customizing only for mirrors"
dpkramer,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"The one island thing is indefensible, even if they told us up front. How many families have more than one child that would want to run their own island without their siblings interfering?

But that isn't why I gave this a zero. The big reason to me is the absolutely clunky and slow menu controls, and constant poor decisions that smack you in the face every time you're trying to enjoy the game.

I get that it's supposed to be ""slow"" and ""charming"", but I think AC fans are too quick to defend the game's charm that they think any criticism on the game is unfounded. If AC fans actually told the devs things that were not great, the series might have progressed since it was created.

This series was created on the GC when a lot of devs were still figuring out the do's and dont's of game development. Things like ""If you're going to make a game about crafting and customization, DON'T make the menu interface INSANELY SLOW, DON'T preface that menu with SLOW, crawling text that asks if you want to craft, DON'T only let us craft one item at a time, then DON'T make a five second craft and ""tadaa!"" animation that can be sped up by like, 5%, by jamming on the buttons, and then DON'T make us have to answer a slow, crawling question about going back into the menu, and doing it all over again. If I want to make a couple darkwood chairs, I have to slowly make each of them one at a (slow) time, then exit that menu and slowly enter the customization menu, and proceed to slowly customize them all, also one at a time.

If I want to figure out how much items sell for, I have to SLOWLY sell each different item alone, because there is no other way to know (also, you have to deal with slow crawling intro text, and you get booted out of the whole thing to start over each time). You know what they could have done? 1) Made it quicker. 2) Made the shops show the sell price as you hover over them, 3) add the pricing somewhere in all that empty space on the critterpedia entries. So many options to have not done it it annoyingly, but they figured out how to avoid all of them.

Don't tell me this is the ""charm"" of the game. The speed was charming back when there was barely anything to do in the game. For some asinine reason, they thought that clunky charm is equal no matter how it's utilized. But in a game that is now all about crafting and customizing at a scale it's never done before, SOMEONE on their team should have said ""uhh, this actually really **** when all you're trying to do is build and customize a couple chairs and a table. Maybe we should change the crafting menu, at least."" I'm hoping that at some point, the shop ""evolves"" and they're like ""haha, look at all these new features! Aren't you happy that it isn't so annoying anymore?"", but even if they did that, I'd still be upset that they chose to screw with us instead of just MAKING IT GOOD.

It ****, because the large majority of the game is good - but it's like someone gave you a delicious ice cream, but then slapped you in the back of your head every time you try to enjoy it."
LuckyHunter,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Can't have my own island. Can't even progress the game or help villagers setup their house because I'm player 2. Literally walking around waiting for player 1 to do something. Glad I paid $80AUD for one and a half slices of pizza, when they advertised the whole pie. Nintendo hates it's fans, but they don't let their hate for you known until you've already bought their game. Disgusting."
Jordboy1,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game is everything I was hoping the first console release since the Wii to be. It takes everything great from the series and expands on it. I admit that as a fan I was bit bogged down by the 3DS New Leaf. It made the game feel more like work and a job to me instead of the laid back relaxing life I was used to in the past titles. However New Horizons makes it just feel like part of the everyday activities. I was afraid of the additions from the mobile game ruining the usual experience as well, but they implemented it in such a way as it just feels like an option and not a requirement to craft at all. Though it does make it nice to have both options when you're low on money OR low on supplies you always have a way to get the tools you need! The airport is an awesome addition as well as it's used for your travel between friends' towns as well as getting to use Nook tickets to visit islands that have more recources than your own! Especially if you play solo. You get the benefits of visiting a friend's island without needing a friend for it! All of the people bashing this game over the shared island when having more than one account on the same system....that's part of the series's charm. You always share an island in every version on the consoles. If you want it to be like on the DS or 3DS you can always get separate Nintendo Switches and have your own islands JUST like on those versions. The fact that you can play locally on the same system at the same time together is a HUGE add to multiplayer and I think they've done so many great things in this version. I also think that the addition of building up to getting the musuem and other buildings in this version is done in a very satisfying way where you don't have everything right away like the old ones (so you feel like there is something to work toward) but it doesn't feel like a chore or a job like in New Leaf. As someone who was a bit disappointed with New Leaf, I love this new one and am excited as I grow my new animal home! See you on that island life, neighbors!"
Deinxceriis,"Mar 24, 2020",7,"One island per console means everyone in the household should buy a Switch right now and you might as well buy more controllers just for the heck of it cause you know they gonna go bad. If you wanna play a good quality game Nintendo is the way to go, but God'dang have fun running around with your kid being able to do nothing they can - no split screen or shared content at all."
Laneybehr,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game makes me so happy! It’s not incredibly story-driven like a lot of today’s games, but it’s more about the day-to-day life of your villager. Instead of checking off quests & deadlines, you set your own pace for how you want to play. Do you want to cross-pollinate flowers to make new colors? Do you want to catch all the fish and find all the bugs? Do you want to fill up your museum? Do you want to design a dream island?? You can do ALL of that - the beauty of this game is that you get to choose what you want to do. It’s not a game about stress, speed, time, combat, or achievements (although there ARE achievements, the game doesn’t revolve around them). It’s about enjoying yourself!

I wish Nintendo had handled the multiplayer a bit differently. And I wish there were more things to do with friends when visiting their island/vice versa! But ultimately this game is relaxing, adorable, and fun.

10/10 would recommend!!"
samuellsilva,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Boring and a unique Islande to create. Quase nada por fazer na ilha. Enfim... Arrependido
Fryerfight,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"Charming & fun! If you’ve played an Animal Crossing game before you’ll know what to expect, if you haven’t, expect a relaxing journey building your own island paradise day by day in real time."
Jadedflames,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I'd probably normally give it a 9, since I reserve 10s for games that land in my ""best ever"" list. But the review bombing here is insane.

This is the best Animal Crossing experience to be had, ever, in my opinion. The quality of life improvements are killer, the fact that you can change the entire island up are great (putting furniture outside? Say whaaaat? Why was this not the norm long ago?)

I have played with online friends for several hours over the last couple of days, there is very little lag, and we are all having a blast.

This doesn't really change much about the formula of animal crossing, and if you have been playing New Leaf for 7 years straight, you may prefer just staying in your old town. But if you want a definitive, next-gen animal crossing on console, this is the best (I mean, the only, but also the best) thing for it.

It's beautiful, adorable, and a better experience than any AC game that came before it. If you are an AC fan, go ahead and get it. if you're not an AC fan, this might change your mind.

If you only wanted to buy this game because of a certain type of multiplayer that you wish it had, but has never had, was never planned to have, and had never been described as having, then go get another game. But it's a great experience, and you will be missing out.

P.S. The museum is my favorite thing about the game. Whoever designed that fossil room needs to design actual museums because I am in love."
12hwilso,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Would be good, but only allows one island per console. Even if I could tolerate that, having multiple people on the island is also broken. No other accounts on the console can progress until the first account to play the game does. Fix this Nintendo."
TempoGamer,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"I have been a fan of the animal crossing series for a long time and the newest entry is a worthy add on the the on going franchise. The new mechanics that were added were some that fans like myself have been asking for for a long time. And now that they have been added I could only dream of the things that could come in the future. The only complaint I have is the slow start, but that's fine. I don't mind taking my time with a game."
Bogavante,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Animal Crossing New Horizons is a refreshing entry in the series by combining the best aspects of previous games and polishing them. As a whole New Horizons most resembles the GameCube entry from the early 2000s. With this resemblence comes a few features being cut but in exchange many have been added mostly in the way of customization from the freedom to place whatever you want on the island to the ability to change your characters physical appearance when a mirror is present. Overall NH is a fantastic entry.
indrct,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Lol 1 island per switch and my wife played first. So I'm **** out of luck huh?

Wont buy the next nintendo console, easy decision for me."
levilaurence,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"An absolutely wonderful game. I've played every Animal Crossing to date and this is the most polished so far, great mechanics. However, the game completely halts progress for second and subsequent players. Despite having a great time with what I have already played, I'm not going to go back to it because I can't really do much except customize my house and pay my debt, which is beginning to get repetitive. I will update this with a better rating if Nintendo either allows the second player to progress the same as the first player or lets us create multiple islands (which would be preferable). Until then, especially if you want to play this with your family, don't bother."
Megnitogorsk,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Always been a huge Animal Crossing fan, since the original. I love all the tiny details Nintendo included. It’s just so cute! It’s definitely making lockdown a lot more bearable."
Aldrost,"Mar 24, 2020",3,"It's a fun game, arguably 10/10 if you are going to be the only one playing it in your household. If you plan on having more than one person play on the same console, don't even bother buying it. It's a shame they let greed get the better of them by trying to force you to purchase multiple consoles considering how great this game would be without this problem. Unfortunately, it's a huge problem for many."
BeeBoy4,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"The best Animal Crossing edition yet! Amazing graphics and improved gameplay, I absolutely love it and it's the perfect thing to keep occupied with throughout this period of social distancing due to covid-19"
Maltri,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Animal Crossing New Horizon is a great new entry to the series. While I have a couple of complaints, the good outweighs the bad BY FAR. As a cute, slice of life game, its thrilling to see your villagers come to life around town and build up the game from the very beginning. It really feels liks you have a good grasp of every aspect of the island. I understand people are upset that you only have one island per switch, but thats the point? You build and decorate together. And I am a bit disappointed that not everyone can contribute to the development of land, but thats similar to New leaf as well. All in all, the game is lovely and deserves more than what most if these terrible reviews give it."
Tanookii,"Mar 24, 2020",10,It’s basically new leaf but better in any way possible and local multiplayer is fun!! if only i can give an 11/10 i totally recommend this fire ****
johny17202,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Tossing my review in with the rest. I don't mind the sharing the island aspect. A crap idea to be sure, but if that's how the creative minds want to play it then fine I'll play.

What I find despicable is the 2nd, 3rd, etc players not being to experience a real game. You are in fact a villager that the main player allows the ability to do what they want. I don't know who in Nintendo decided that was a good idea, but imagine living in a household where only one person matters and everyone else is subservient to that one person. Kind of goes against the idea of building social ties, sharing and having fun. Sharing in my mind isn't only sharing space, but also in sharing responsibility and choice.

The dictatorial feel of the single console multiplayer of this game destroys its value for me as I'm now subservient to player one. I can't do anything other than farm and wait for player one to plan the city out and progress the story. Imagine save locking a pc so only one player can get to play a game. How ridiculous is that? Well welcome to Animal Crossing New Horizons. Want to play the real game like player one? Go buy a new switch."
Gliz,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Literally and unabashedly the greatest game I have ever played in my life. I have always been a fan of Animal Crossing, and this is by and far the greatest in the series. Over a dozen of my friends and I play together, and every single day we're so excited to see what will happen, what will change, what will unlock, etc. Cannot praise this game enough."
SainxtrichX,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"I started this game without great expectations, and it ended up being an extremely relaxing experience.
You will not be able to do everything in one day, the game waits for you to come in daily and connect to play. For this reason I highly recommend having a digital version.
The issue of having only one island per console takes away some points, but in my case I do not share my console with other people because it is not a problem.
If you are in quarantine like I recommend I take a look at this game."
Daii,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Need another switch to play with my girlfriend?!? Didnt think multiplayer through at all Nintendo just want you to buy more Switch consoles
donowolf,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"As has been mentioned many times here already, I do not agree that Nintendo should mandate the ""one user per system"" restriction they have made by allowing the creation of only one island. This game doesn't deserve positive reviews until this is remedied."
Psychocid,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Same as the rest i assume. Being 2nd player is terrible. You get no story progression or advancements. 1st player gets all of the story recipes and rewards, while 2nd player just plays the basic casual backend.

Its obviously a shameless money grab by Nintendo, who, already is known for their overpriced ridiculousness. Theyre attempting to get people to buy more switches on impulse and desire to experience the full package. The upsell.

I wont be buying a second game or a second switch just for that. This is 2020, multiple console saves ARE a thing.

Ex: Day 3 get to placing out the new home plots, Nook gives player 1 the plots to decide where they go. Not only that, it then gives player 1 ALL of the recipes required to build the materials for the 3 homes. Player 2 gets no recipes for anything or the option to even purchase them.

TLDR: If youre player 2-8 for that island, you getting shafted.

BTW, as follow-up, its obvious the reviews are mixed. You can tell who is the solo/single console players are here vs the family/multiple console people."
jasonridesabike,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Created an account just to review this game. It's great if your 1 player per console but otherwise it's just a demo of the game for everyone but the first person to start. Critical milestones are locked behind progress that only the person who opened the game first can make (the Island Representative).

A petty marketing gimmick to sell more consoles. Between this and the scummy mobile game, Nintendo is on track to become the next EA."
Nath666,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game is amazing, people who rate it low are idiots, they should know what it's about and how it works, Nintendo were telling you how the one island per console works months ago! This game is great and the best animal crossing yet!"
AkirakurusuX,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I never write reviews but i needed to do this one to counter the brainless review-bombers/trolls. Anyways this is one if not the most wholesome game i've ever played. And it came in perfect timing with the whole coronavirus situation... I've played New Leaf but this one is in another level of adiction with me and my girlfriend already puting lots of hours since launch. The new crafting mechanic is a lot of fun and keeps the game fresh and the customization options of looks and house + quality of life improvements are very welcome.
Definitely a must play for Switch owners."

rungefam16,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I love this game and i am very excited to have it. It makes you play it like you should, keeps you having to come back with a little bit every day. I personally do not mind only having one island, that is how the game was when the original came out. I love that i can organise my island and the crafting is interesting. Its the same as the old but made in a new refreshing way."
Mspigglypooh,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"I couldn't wait to play this game! I've been playing animal crossing since it first came out for the GameCube. That being said I'm really impressed with what this new game brings to the table. I absolutely love the single-player gameplay with New Horizon. It's just as relaxing as all of the previous games and it adds so much more to do. I also enjoyed inviting a close friend of mine to visit my island. It was very easy to do and we both enjoyed our time.  I would say the crappy part about it was having to type to each other to communicate. That was a pain to do but nevertheless we still enjoyed visiting each other. I have yet to try to play with family (We do have two switch systems, however, my son is too young to know how to play and my husband cares more for Smash bros than anything else lol), however, despite it not personally affecting me there should have still been a much better way this could have been implemented for those it does have an effect on. It's not fair that they have to go through so much (even as far as buying another system) just to play with one another when they shouldn't have to. If I remember correctly, in the first animal crossing game you could all live in the same location, so why make it different now? I will however still be fair with my rating. I don't think the game deserves a 0 because of that as it brings a lot to the table, but I cannot give it a 10 when multiplayer is not up to par."
raular5,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Not enough innovation.

Wgardner83,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I love this game, It’s my first Animal Crossing. I love all the stuff to do, in this crazy world today, it’s a nice relaxing game to get away from reality. My household has 3 switches though, so the single island to a switch thing don’t bother me."
magnuhawkwind,"Mar 24, 2020",3,"This is only a full game for the first person to boot it up on the system. It is not made clear to anyone either before purchase or during the beginning of the game that players who are sharing the island with the Island Representative (player 1) will have a very limited experience. Secondary players are progress limited to the IR, and do not get the same DIY recipes provided for them that the IR gets for free. I can't fathom why Nintendo would do this other than to encourage people to buy extra switches. To be extra clear, this is not a full game if you have multiple users. If you are sharing a Nintendo and are sold on the sharing an island feature advertised, you are being misled.

If I could return the digital copy I would, it is very upsetting to have been sold something so cynically designed. I share the game with my SO, and the limited experience has ruined it for her, which in turn has ruined the game for me. Both of us were excited since the game was announced and now, 4 days after launch, neither of us wants to touch it."

I’ve seen many people say that the lack of the ability to have multiple islands has completely ruined their experience, but to me, that doesn’t even compare to all the things done right in this game. Refinement of new features, amazing new features, it’s all there. Even if this game isn’t the best Switch game quality-wise, it certainly feels like the most polished of the bunch. Definitely worth the buy!"

SurgeOfDurge,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Annoying, repetitive, a tedious hassle, way too simple on tutorials while also not giving gameplay tips/important guidal info.

JC839,"Mar 24, 2020",4,"Multiplayer is broken. There is several issues with the multiplayer for non-representative resident players. They are severely limited in progressing the game: The non-RR player is:

-Unable to unlock the DIY recipes acquired through progressing game -Lacks access to purchasing items from the catalog that the representative player has bought/unlocked
-Cannot use or unlock emotes -Cannot increase relationship with villagers
-The non-RR is unable to progress in the game beyond what the representative player has made that day. And often, not even that and is unable to progress at all
-The second player serves almost no purpose. If you share an island and are the non-RR character, the game is rendered essentially pointless. It desperately needs to be patched"
vontrev,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"If you have 2 people playing on the same switch all progress is locked behind the first person who loads up the game on the switch. you cannot have multiple islands and the second player cannot progress without the first one doing all of the progression stuff first. pointless and horrifically badly designed, how an oversight this large could possibly be made is beyond comprehension."

Shut_up_meg,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"My girlfriend and I place this together and it is awesome!! You have 1 island but as long as you play on different profiles, multiple ppl can live on the same island and there is no reason you can't progress and build on each profile. We can even play together at the same time! But usually one of us will play at a time and progress and build our homes into bigger houses.

This game was worth every penny and for true animal crossing fans, it's everything you missed and wanted from the original!

I've been playing this for hrs since I got it and it is not slowing down. We are constantly trying to build our houses,get better furniture and such,get new items and tools, catch different kinds of fish and bugs etc., build our island too look better and build a better shop. And I still haven't gotten to the 2nd half of the island! Able to visit friends islands, visit random default islands, customize your character, transfer items from pocket camp! Worth it! My girlfriend is playing right now!"

CkRules,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"I'm a long time fan of the Animal Crossing series and this is by far my favorite! The crafting system is awesome and the ability to have 8 players on a single island is awesome. It seems a lot of people don't get the community aspect of this series, and want to complain about the single island per console deal. I can understand why you would want the option to make a brand new save without loosing your original, but to complain that you and your wife cant have seperate islands, really misses the point of this long standing series. Why wouldnt you want to share an island with your wife or kids ...thats the point. Everyone gets to participate together, to create an awesome island that can be built over, literally, years. My wife and I work together to create a happy and healthy community. You can terraform the terrain, craft new items, work together to populate the museum, and more! This is a community building game. The only improvment I would have liked is for everyone in a multiplayer session to have imidiate access to their items without having to switch leaders. The fact you can only have one Island per system isnt a deal breaker, at all. People want to think that Nintendo did this solely for the purposes of selling more Switches, but the way I see it, this is more of a system built to prevent exploiting the game. As I recall, the only game that didnt limit the number of islands per console was the original, and that worked cuz the online capabilitiesof the game cube were very limited. Even the Ds games worked like this. And sure, it would have been cool if they could have solved this in a different **** the switch doesnt save to the game cartridge, they are read only memory cards. So your island MUST be tied to your internal storage of the Switch. If everyone could make multiple islands, then the game would be very exploitable. I wish that Nintendo could have solved this problem while still allowing multiple islands, or at least one Island per account, but then anyone could make multiple accounts and create. But in New Leaf, i didnt see nearly as much hate for the fact that you had to buy the game twice to make a new file. And like I said, Switch carts are read only, so the game save has to be tied to the console. They could have done cloud storage, but that would mean any user without a subscription is locked out of the game. If Ni te di really wanted to milk their customers, they would ha e provided all the tools and recipies and exclusive tools and recipes, for purchase online. But no. You get the whole game and never have to pay another cent to enjoy it."
RosemaryRally,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Uh oh looks like Nintendo forgot to put a game in their game.

To be fair, you can spend 4 years snorting coke and make the game in the last 6 weeks

Indianascones82,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Y'all obviously Never played animal crossing it's always been one village per **** you have an option to go to other islands to get supplies... this is one of the most polished of the series ...if every person got their way animal crossing would be like every other farming game...good job Nintendo ! **** it y'all spoiled haters
HagarDHorible,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Multiplayer is a joke.  I bought it for my kids and only one gets the missions.  Nintendo should know better.
AyaMidoria,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"I'm already addicted to the game.
Pros:
The graphics are gorgeous, the items keep me interested in collecting, but I don't feel the need to rush through everything in order to do so. I love the character interactions and the animations are very cute.
Cons:
The RNG could probably be more balanced? Some of the UI could have been more streamlined. I see why people are upset about the lack of content for a second islander, but to me, it feels the same as how New Leaf operated, one character making all the decisions while the others build up their own stuff. Though maybe I'm biased since I have no-one to share the island with except filler characters anyway. Definitely a bit short-sighted decision wise, but not as greedy as some other companies."
Timmer421,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I think it is ridiculous that Nintendo thought it would be acceptable to make it so you can only have one island per switch console. There are families that have shared consoles across their kids. So what, are they supposed to buy another two or three switches and games so that everyone can have their own island? Every other switch game can save on separate accounts for different people to play through, so I know that this wasn’t because they didn’t have the capability to allow people their own islands, it is 100% obvious it was a money grab opportunity for them. It’s really upsetting because it is a great game so far, it’s a shame that 2+ people can’t play it on their own accounts with their own islands. You had to take a bigger step from making people buy separate games to play different towns in New Leaf to making people buy their own switches plus another copy of New Horizons. Even a step further, you made it so that when someone else is playing on the creators island, they can do next to nothing to make their own kind of progress. I tried to put up with that form of multiplayer but it is extremely irritating and pointless to even play it at that point. Way to take the fun out of such a promising game Nintendo."
FormerGlory89,"Mar 24, 2020",1,Why are holidays locked to being downloaded only. Why are we locked to one island per system. Why is Nintendo doing everything they can to make sure consumers don’t enjoy a game how they want. Selling the game how I did Luigis Mansion 3 and New Super Mario Bothers Deluxe if it’s not fixed.
SuperCrab,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game is most likely the best game I’ve ever played. The amount of things to do is so amazing. However, I can see it not appealing to certain people. This game is a game with basically no action, so if you don’t like relaxing games without the rush a fighting/shooter game would give you, don’t play this. Anyways, 10/10"
PinkMagic,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"We love it! I would rate it 11.  Super customizable, fun and challenging, gender expansive, visit friends and share messages and items. And it is only getting better as we play."
Shcduffman,"Mar 24, 2020",0,The game has become way to frustrating and really lame having to share an island. Just like every other game out there. A different user on the switch should be able to have their own island. Plain and simple. What a waste of $65
Cassiel,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Couldn't have made a better sequel and decisions! There so much more to do compared to past entries! The multiplayer aspect is really good despite being dependent on the primary player for a lot of things. Looking forward to the seasonal events!
pizzo,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I bought the game digitally but being the console shared with my girlfriend I discovered that we cannot play two saves with two different islands.  All this is unacceptable, to play in two you must have two switches when instead with all the other games you can have two accounts.  I hope they fix this otherwise it deserves 0, not having given me the opportunity to deepen the game."
Lostprophets4,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Like many of the reviewers I have run into the problem where any progress I have is gated by the first resident of the island. My wife played the game when it first came in the mail on Friday. Now over the weekend and into this week I have not been able to get the ladder to explore our island as she has not done the mandatory quests that she can only complete. I have lost any ability to progress in the game and lost complete interest in the game due to 0 progression or purpose in playing.
sneakycrown,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game is literally the best in the entire Animal Crossing series, ignore the review bombers. You have more control over the customization of your village than EVER before, and it does have a ""deserted island"" feel to the game until you give it your own spin and begin to find a comfortable spot in your island. My friends and I have had nothing but fun times on this game playing together so far (even though it is admittedly young in its life) and its helping several through the quarantine. Ignore the people that are being whiny little babies, please, I implore you. Nintendo legitimately worked hard on this game and pumped out a game that is, in my mind, one of the greatest games on the switch so far. From crafting to being able to be knocked out by several more bugs to many of our special character favourites returning, this is a VERY good addition to the series, and I would almost say perhaps my favourite one yet."
Wimsey,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"Only 1 islind for 1 console, are you serious? My wife started plaing AC, and i'm missing all the story. And we cant even move the save to different console. Thats pretty dumb limitations to force us for buing additional copy of the game."
JTShadow,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"A near perfect implementation of a classic series! This is an early review but so far the game has everything you've come to love in the series with new features added to help keep you engaged in the game.

Quality of life improvements were implemented such as icons notifying you if an item has been donated to the museum already though I do wish that feature was extended to all items in general to make it easier to determine what you already have in your catalog. One common complaint I hear echoed is the fact that you can only have one island per system/cartridge but that is only a minor issue, especially with the lower cost of a Switch Lite. One wouldn't expect to share one cartridge and one 3ds and have multiple towns with New Leaf, so this expectation for the Nintendo Switch is pretty entitled. My wife and I as well as our two children play happily on our own consoles and enjoy the multiplayer aspect of the game, though I do hope to be surprised eventually to find minigames like Tortimer Island had."
EmperorAzir,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"So I made this post cause I felt this is a worthy sequel to new leaf and has added and built off previous ideas.  That being said I dont care for the tools breaking but I understand it and have even learn the system more.  I don't hold issues with the one island per console as it makes sense as the house can have their own singular Island.

The new temp 1 off islands make for a fresh way to find new critters as Well as find some villagers.  There is also new ways to trade and buy items as Well as new ways to build stuff you want."
Aivi,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I dont think that one switch for one island is bad or good. I played the original games and hated them because it was boring to me. Now I get to go on and drop gifts off for my boyfriend in front of his house, hop over to my roommates island and hang out with either one and and drop gifts for them too. I think it's fun to see what's different when I wake up and discussing what to do or where to out things. It makes it more of a community game."
RuMona,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Love this game. It is pretty different from the previous titles but I think it is quite refreshing.
Peachplum,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I had such high hopes for this game, and I was immensely let down. Only being able to have one island is ridiculous. We have to have two separate NSO accounts, but can't have two saves? Nintendo, you are showing your EA colors."
Hdogg,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"In addition to the absolutely ridiculous stunt Nintendo pulled by forcing you to have to buy AN ENTIRE NEW CONSOLE IF MORE THAN ONE PERSON WANTS TO PLAY THE GAME, the game is boring and not rewarding at all. It feels like a mobile game because you can barely do anything before running out of things to do. At least in mobile games they give you the option to pay money to progress. Harvest Moon: AWL is way better than this game and it came out over a decade ago. Animal Crossing has to be one of the most overrated games of all time."
Emily1,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I made this account just to say how horrifically greedy Nintendo are for making users share a game save across the console. I don't know if any other game that force you to do this.

The game pace is set my the initial character. You share the same destination and  cannot progress past the initial players position. If you have multiple kids or anyone wanting to play this seperately, too bad. You don't just have to buy a seperate game cartridge you need a WHOLE NEW CONSOLE meaning if you want your own saved game, you have to pay literally HUNDREDS just for the pleasure of doing so. Nintendo can take their console, lube it up with the tears of their disappointed customers and shove it up their money hungry nook hole.

We've been waiting 7 years and this is what you do. Thanks I'm SO glad I waited for this game."
Addikins,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"A wonderful opportunity ruined by progression locked without any form of warning. If you’re the main player but let your spouse or family member play first then it ruins the experience for all secondary players including yourself.

I’m having to delete my save that I’ve put an enormous amount of time into after 5 days in-game just because of this oversight. No way to switch the island representative or delete the main player without remaking the entire island. It is heartbreaking."
Ghilreath,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Very good game, I've never played an animal crossing Game before, but this title"
Ashleyola,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Some of you have never played an Animal Crossing game and it shows. This game is great. It improves upon almost every aspect of the game. So sad that some of you feel the need to throw an online tantrum because you didn’t research the game before buying. To everyone else, buy this game! You’ll have loads of fun!"
eugenioanez,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Step in and stop review bombing, Metacritic! It’s unfair for developers and gamers."
Denvers,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"Firstly, i would like to say, this is a game I would totally give a 9 or a 10 if it weren't for some HUGE issues. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a FANTASTIC single player experience and is the best game in the installment by far. The game is charming as always and the new crafting mechanic adds so much to the game as a whole. Now, instead of catching bugs, fishing, and gathering fruit to sell to buy items, you can make your own tools and furniture. Another great addition this game has is the deserted islands you can visit. You are allowed to visit small, deserted islands and gather as many resources there as you can hold to bring back to your island. This helps lower the time it takes to gather enough resources to build a new building or upgrade an old one. Nook Miles is a new addition as well - a currency that you get just by doing things like catching bugs, chopping down trees, and selling items for bells! This makes doing simple little things rewarded. Nook Miles Plus allows you to do simple tasks like catch 5 bugs and then adds a new one right away for you to complete. Here's the main issue with the game - for each copy of Animal Crossing you own, you can only have ONE ISLAND. This would be fine if it were just yourself playing, but other players can't have their own experience AND can't do a lot of things in the game if they don't own the island. Even if you have 2 Nintendo Switches, you can only have one island per copy of Animal Crossing you own. This makes the game so much less enjoyable for other players for no reason - Nintendo could have EASILY allowed for multiple saves. In addition to that, islands can't bew recovered via Nintendo Switch Online which was a major selling point of NSO - backups. Nintendo will recover your island up to one time if you get a new system or break your old one, but after that, you are on your own. I wish Nintendo would fix these issues, because if they did, this game would be nearly perfect. Still, if you don't plan on breaking your Switch and aren't playing with anyone else, I can't reccomend this game enough."
Smock948,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"The best Animal Crossing yet. Ignore all the 0s, it's a bunch of children **** about one or two features instead of calmly and reasonably reviewing the game in totality."
thoromir825,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game is incredible. So beautiful, more than ever to do, well paced. The amount of polish alone in this game would be enough for this 10 but add in the fact that it's fun, rewarding and just lets you escape into a world of beauty and serenity. It's a game for the ages. I understand there are users talking about the inability to make island progress without the work of the initial player on the island, but that system does make sense to me in some ways and they very well may fix it in a patch if that is a concern of yours. I feel for those who are in that situation but I believe the game is good enough to deserve much better than it's getting for one multiplayer system that they did not advertise quite how it works."
Robbyiss,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"People have valid concerns with the oversight of a single island on each switch, however I don't believe that makes the game a 0/10. There is truly some trash games on the eShop and New Horizons is not one of them. Since everyone is basing their review on this one flaw, I'll base mine with the fact that I don't share the game with anyone so the game has been perfect for me."
Sootball,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Amazing game, great way to relax and spend time enjoying the mundane. A classic that improves with every new iteration."
Ariawho24,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Waiting for new animal crossing for so long and this is exactly what I was waiting for.
TeddyMarinaro,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"An excellent addition to the series! New Horizons expands on the tried and true formula of laid back task management and town expansion by adding a simple yet deep crafting component, and then allowing players to apply this to the island as a whole!

For those new to the game, yes it revolves around you paying off your debt to a capitalist raccoon, but the tasks you undertake to reach that frankly easy goal are fishing, catching bugs and more, things that play well into the concept of something relaxing.

While the restriction of one island to console is interesting, I believe it was a choice made to tie it into the other games which have had the same gesture to allow for people to work together on the same island and grow it as a group, while also limiting play time so that one can experience other things. While that may not be everyone's cup of tea, the game was designed by someone who enjoyed these game activities in real life, so perhaps one should take a page out of the creator's book and try them in real life!"
JackDGood,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Best animal crossing ever,  don’t listen to bad reviews, they are just mad cause they spent all there money on toilet paper.
1 island thing stinks but does not make this a bad game.
Great job Nintendo!!!"
BlankCaption,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I have been extremely excited to try this game. But I am someone who honestly has control issues when it comes to how I want to organize my island. My fiance is also very excited to play, and I let her play first. We played a little bit together, though it was immediately apparent that the first player was important and my character doesn't have a story or any sort of contribution other than existing to pick stuff up for the main person or organize my tent.

So, oh well, I figured. We could turn it off and I could play alone and start setting some stuff ****...except I can't. **** the museum isn't **** my fiance has to work from home right now because of COVID and has no time to play so I am stuck on an island with absolutely nothing to do.Thanks for the waste of 80 bucks Nintendo. The scam, trying to force people to buy more switches is disgusting"
AyeJay,"Mar 24, 2020",0,As a huge fan of the game it makes me sad that Nintendo is doing everything in their power to largely prevent what had built their industry from the beginning. It's an obvious problem that is not hard to fix and I really hope they find a way to make it co-op friendly.
cakarot,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"As it is right now, I have to give it a 0 since you can only have 1 island per switch and my girlfriend is the primary player. Since I can not create my own island without paying $360 for a new switch and new game, it was a waste of money for me. There's absolutely no reason why in this day and age you should only be able to enjoy a game like this on a per console basis. If they change that so I can also make a new game then I will change my score, but as it stands this seems borderline criminal, anti-consumer, and it appears to be a cash grab by Nintendo. I can only imagine the problems this causes in households with children trying to play."
beantaco,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Terrible, one island per switch, greed of nintendo is displayed here. They have no care for their supporters if they are willing to rob them of their money. Please don’t buy until they fix this."

jjenninnggss,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I created a metacritic account for the sole purpose of expressing my disappointment in this game. It'd be a 10 for the single player game, but the terrible way they handled multiplayer ruins it. I let my wife take the lead, only to find I can't progress. Plus, playing at the same time with local coop is a joke. I'd rather sit back and watch someone else play. Like others have pointed out, this is a blatant and disappointing money grab by Nintendo."
AmericanNinja95,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Animal Crossing New Horizons is the best Animal Crossing game I have ever played! I have played since Thursday night and have loved every minute of it.
Kba,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"The game is deep, charming and endless. Customization and quality of life improvements make New Horizons the best AC to date. And please stop giving the game zeroes for not having features that weren't advertised. Nintendo made it clear that it was one island per Switch. I don't agree with it, but at least give the game a seven or eight and give a substantive review."
UraniumDonut,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Lackluster, it only allows for one Island per console. Progress is all right and the aesthetics are nice"
Gorand,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"The local multiplayer is terrible. For an idea of the target audience, the settings only have 2 options, and has a raccoon tell you to get your parents before using them. I tried to get my money back, but Nintendo's return policy isn't as good as Steams."

Xantus2522,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Game is unplayable as a second account. Constant progress locks and zero say in island customization completely ruins the experience. Will update rating if Nintendo allows individual islands.

Intelligimus,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Limiting the number of accounts/island on a family game is appalling, if you want multiple people in your house to play you are required to have multiple switch’s even though Nintendo allow you to have multiple profiles on one switch this game and progress is locked to one profile."
dezin2020,"Mar 24, 2020",1,Multiplayer is horrible you have to guess when your friend is in online shared mode to join them just to add them to your ingame friend list to message them. One island per switch is also a bad move and seems like this game have less items then previous games
rinks361,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Really fun game! It's a nice change of pace from all the run and gun type of games that have been coming out lately. Haven't had a self-paced game this interesting since I played **** Valley. There's always something new to explore, things to upgrade and decorate. It's sad that people are complaining that there's no ""objective"" to obtain or arrive at are obviously new to Animal Crossing and didn't understand what they were getting into. That's like a fan of action movies going to watch a romance movie and then rating it low because there was no action in it...

AC:NH has charming graphics, the iconic dialog speech patterns, and plenty to see and do for the hardcore fans of the series. I never played the other games but this one immediately hooked me into playing every single day. I'm hoping for expansions to the island sizes as the starting areas are pretty small."
NeoKrox,"Mar 24, 2020",10,#EpicWin This game is everything we love about the franchise and much more.
TempestTeacup,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Absolutely adorable, relaxing, and fun. Perfect for sheltering in place. It’s extremely polished and improves on some of the more tedious elements of old games. It’s truly spectacular."
E_Z_E,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"This is a very fun game if you are playing single player. Multi-player definitely has its flaws and only being able to have one island per console kind of ****. Personally I don't find it that much of a problem myself since I'm the only one playing the game and I don't have access to internet. There is a few minor things I would have changed but all in all a solid game. Be vigilant and do your research before you buy a game, unlike the people review bombing this game"
HCritic,"Mar 24, 2020",10,It is the game you need right now! A gem full of things to do with or without friends. A graphically and mechanically polished game that enters the top games of the year!
Kazaa916,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Nintendo made the greedy decision to only allow one island per a switch even if you have two copies of animal crossing. If more than one person in the house wants to play and have their own island you must own multiple switches.
Duero,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Made an account just to say this games great, love sharing an island with my fiancee.  Together, we can power through collecting resources and we get to share the joy of having the same villagers."
ottolotl,"Mar 24, 2020",0,One island per switch should be changed. It is a terrible money hungry idea and it should be fixed in the next patch
santoryu,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"1. This game is absolutely phenomenal. A perfect follow-up to New Leaf. I can't stop fishing and catching bugs and exploring the other deserted islands. I can't wait to be able to use amiibos and move Stitches into my island!!!

2. Animal Crossing has always been one town per memory card/console. It's been like this from the first iteration of the dang game on GameCub. You had to buy a second memory card to have a second town.

3. There was SO MUCH MEDIA surrounding this game that warned y'all you couldn't have a second island. It was quite literally everywhere.  It shouldn't have been a surprise to you, and if it was, maybe you should research games before you buy them?"
Saiyangod,"Mar 24, 2020",1,Game is amazing. Ruined it with the one island system. Will have to buy another switch now just like Nintendo wants.
Sembubble,"Mar 24, 2020",10,This game is a heap if fun for all animal crossing veterans and new players! The new crafting feature is really intuitive and it dowant feel like some crafting is put of reach like in other games. The game is rewarding and always gives you something to work on. I'm really glad I picked it up.
Kkslider,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is definitely the best in the series.  It takes everything up a notch.  The characters are as lovable as in Population Growing again, and the world is as huge as well.  Building the world how you want from New Leaf is completely ramped up, and the world is more full of fish and bugs than ever.  Crafting completely changes the game, allowing the player to enjoy the game at night or early morning, even though shops are closed.  This is truly a triumphant return for Animal Crossing, and the game will be even better when the dlc arrives.  If you enjoyed any Animal Crossing game, you'll love this one, and if you've never given Animal Crossing a shot, now's certainly the time.  Those new to Animal Crossing will love the game, and those who have played an AC game, or fans since the original (like me) will absolutely adore it.  - kkslider"
blackholebomb,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"So this game is better than any Animal Crossing game before it, it adds a ton of new features and adds to the flavor of the world of Animal Crossing, helping you become more invested in your game over all.

However there have been a number of complains about the ""one island per console"". This has always been the case for Animal Crossing, that anyone playing on the same console and/or cart would share the world with their other family members. GameCube is the exception because it had memory cards. Just like before, if everyone wants their own isolated experience, then you need to have your own system. That's what the Switch Lite is for, it's meant to be the 3DS/DS/GBA to the Wii U/Wii/GC of its generation, except we get to play all the same games now. So like before, get your own system and copy of the game, business as usual. You probably were a single console multiple handheld family before, so be a multiple Switch family."
FlyingPiloswine,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"I am a single player that does not have to share an island, and who sees online interactions as a small quirk instead of a needed feature. This game is amazing for me.

However, I am 100% in support of the anger and frustration my fellow users who have to share an island are experiencing. If I had to share with a sibling or my wife, I would be extremely angry. It just isn't fair that you don't get your own save file and agency. We all can't afford multiple game consoles for the sole purpose of having a unique save file. That is downright preposterous, and I am certain it was some big wig exec who decided that."
adultjuicebox,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Super cute, but as a second player I cannot do anything and there is no point to even playing the game. It is ludicrous that in order to create my own island and actually play the game I have to get a second switch. Really?  Solid money grab, Nintendo. BOO"
ZWiz25,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing New Horizons, is by far the best game in the series. The game starts off differently from every other animal **** start in a barren island with 2 other villagers and a very bare bones shop. You also can’t reach the majority of the island yet. As you progress you gain new tools that help collect bugs, fish, and building supplies. You’ll eventually see more shops move in as you also gain new tools like the pole vault and ladder to explore the rest of the island. It’s extremely fun to see the island develop into a full on town. While the game does take days to get new things, you can easily skip that process by using time travel (I personally don’t). My main complaint is the multiplayer. For at least where I am now, there’s not much to do besides visit your friends island and not much more. But in end I do really enjoy my time playing the game and think it’s an easy 10/10 game."
bon-s,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I love Animal Crossing, but I cannot give this game anything higher than 0 because of just how ridiculously and blaringly obvious some flaws are.

-One island per console. Families or couples are locked behind whatever the first player profile has done. You cannot progress if the other islander has played less than you. This is absolutely intentional by Nintendo as to entice you to have one Switch per person. Greed.

-Online multiplayer is a joke. Even when you have people added as best friends, you cannot place any furniture. It gets incredibly boring very quickly when all you can do is fish and catch bugs with friends. At least on New Leaf you could go to Tortimer's Island, to meet new people or with friends, you could play minigames and grind expensive bugs and fish.

-No dream towns, which was a fantastic way to check out themed towns. On that note, now it's much harder to theme your town as shops etc are not in a separate instance i.e high street.

-Duplication glitch has absolutely demolished the trading community. Anyone that isn't cheating cannot buy anything for a reasonable price anymore. How there hasn't been a small patch for nearly a week now is crazy.

It honestly just feels like a big step backwards for the franchise. Some pros so it's not all negative below:

-Graphics are beautiful

-You can move trees, bamboo and buildings

-Terraforming

I'll change the score if they ever fix these problems."
KoiFish,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"It’s a good game, well designed, good art direction, lots to create. It’s not a game for everybody, but if you’re even a little creative you’ll enjoy it and it’ll be relaxing fun. However the game does drop a point for me due to the forced sharing of an island on the same console. It has always been part of the franchise, but it was largely due to technological limitations in my opinion. But sharing an island isn’t horrible in fact it can lead to a much more interesting experience. If we ever get the option to have separate islands my score will go up to a nine. Long and short of it is: if you think you’d like it, you will. If you’re interested give it a try"

missingno5,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I never write reviews. I absolutely love this game. It’s a blast. However, the collaborative aspect of the game is incredibly flawed. I bought this game with the intention of sharing an island with my girlfriend. However, only one of us has complete control of the island. The other villager is locked out of certain aspects of the game. This makes no sense to me. Surprisingly, the original game well over a decade ago got this part of the game right: everyone had equal control. Why is this hard to do in 2020? The whole idea that there should be one leader and everyone else should be handicapped is insane."
Katskywalker,"Mar 24, 2020",0,The fact that only one player per household gets to go on the missions and collect the prizes while every other player is locked out of missions is rediculous. It seems like a ploy from Nintendo to get households to purchase multiple switch consoles.
AmandaR,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"This is a great game, it's super relaxing and fun to play. It's cool that you can craft items in this game. I don't get why people are complaing about how only the one person can do certain things on the island since most of the previous games were like this. In the 3DS only the one player was the mayor, so this wasn't really a surprise."

Kahvinheitin,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I was so anxiously waiting for this game!!!

I have been waiting for two generations to be able to play Animal Crossing, because I wasn’t interested on playing on my daughters island previously, and I thought that finally I could get my own island as Switch OS has own profiles for each player for each game.

But what is this!? I should buy two more Switches and three copies of the game so that my daughters can get their own islands and I could get my own?

What if my Wife wants to play? I need to buy a fourth Switch!?!

This Switch deal is getting worse and worse.

Animal Crossing has always been a 1 island per console/game. The way this game is presented to you is nothing new or out of the ordinary from previous games.

That being said, the actual review: My wife and I have taken turns passing the controller back and forth for a combined 48 hours now and we're loving every minute.  Do things get repetitive? Yes, they can.  Do you run out of things to do? Yes, you can.  Is that any reason to not play this game?  No not at all.  This game is everything we've waited for, and more. We're going to happily play this game every day we possibly can, through every season we possibly can, and for AS LONG as we possibly can."

c_anthony,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great solo game that innovates and improves on most facets of the previous entries in the series and advertises that you can play with up to eight players on one island!
On the surface it sounds great, and it can be if you only want to play solo. This is a social game though, meant to be enjoyed by more than one person, and that experience is unfortunately ruined by some unbelievably poor design choices and limitations.
The only player who gets any real meaningful control over the island is the one who begins the game. They get to build villager's houses, place community buildings, etc. All players who come after them are treated like second-rate citizens, are given no control over virtually anything, and have a significantly diminished experience.
Through their failings, Nintendo has ruined what would have been an amazing experience for people to enjoy together. Unless you intend to play this game solo I suggest avoiding it."
Admiralpdxtr,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Any reviews stating that there's only one island per console are true and valid, and I completely understand why anyone with friends would be disappointed by this game. But the people who keep saying 'its slow and confusing to progress' or 'I shouldn't have to wait days to get something' have no idea what they're talking about. This isn't CoD my dudes. You bought a sim game. Would you write the same review for Minecraft? You're not supposed to rush the story and finish the game. This isn't a speedrun, it's a form of escapism and just because the end goal isn't to send Tom nook hurtling into the depths of hell to save the earth doesn't give you the right to give it a bad review like it's a poorly made game. If you're gonna do that, there are plenty of valid reasons to complain about this game. Other than the weird one island thing, it's very fun and I thoroughly enjoy it."
Ununheptium,"Mar 24, 2020",4,"Great game, but Nintendo needs to fix the multiplayer couch issue. Every player's account on the switch should be able to access everything and progress.

Worst AC to date if things aren't **** I've played almost every game."
Garblovian,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Broken multi-player ruined the game. The local co-op is the most poorly designed game mechanic I've ever seen.

Beyond that the fact that everyone on a one switch has to share an island is the most desperate attempt to get people to but more switches.

Nachtetraume,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"New Horizons did just that, opened up new horizons for the Animal Crossing series. The new crafting aspect was something I originally wasn't sure I was going to like but I have taken to and really enjoy. Previous titles would just have you doing tasks for your villagers and just catching bugs and fish all day long. New Leaf turned a new leaf making you the mayor of a town and setting up a beautiful location. Now you've got the full reign of the island to make it whatever you want. Having the ability to place villager homes so they don't ruin your flower garden or paths? YES PLEASE! Being able to terraform the land/water scape to make it flow however you want and fill in weird gaps of the map? I'll take it! There's so much to this game that is absolutely amazing and a labor of love from Nintendo.

Socially it does require Nintendo Online to visit your friends. That's pretty common at this point for most game titles for any platform. I find having one island per switch to be amazing. You can share your game cartridge and not worry about someone destroying your hard work when you get it back.

My boyfriend and I do have our own switches so it makes playing easy but I would want to get another game so I don't have to wait for him when I think of a new task for myself. Overall, this is a much needed island vacation!"
TheRealCrow,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Ok we're addicted to this game. The low average is from users putting in zeroes for it not allowing more than one island per switch. Which granted, ****, but none the less this game is nearly perfect!"
NeonChicken,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"Animal Crossing as a game is as wonderful as it ever has been. The new features IN THE GAMEPLAY are fun and welcome. However, I own two Nintendo Switches (OG and Lite) bought the game hoping for cloud saves, no dice. So I set up on the family OG switch, not knowing you may only have ONE ISLAND per console. This has locked my wife and son out of the game for pacing and my son who typically wakes up early to play consumes all the island resources. Ultimately I could just restart on the lite but that would lock me out of the TV side which I enjoy. So the solution would not be to buy another copy of the game it would be to buy a another full switch console. This makes my rating of the game go from a 9-10 to a 2. Another thing which I don't think many have addressed: If I (the first person to play) quits playing the island progression stops too for my son. So in effect I'm sticking with it for the child..."

Aquariusjive,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"More of the same great, relaxing, easy going progression that we’ve come to expect from the series. I do wish we had the ability to create more than one island per switch but it’s FAR from the tragic scenario that other reviewers are making it out to be.
Update:  After playing through quite a few more hours, the family is thoroughly irritated at the fact that our 6 year old is the kid with the dominant profile which is limiting all of our progression. Nintendo, this has to be patched so we can populate different islands with multiple profiles using a single Switch."
rickycarrillo,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"To say that  co-op is terrible, or that the game isn't fair, simply means that you're not putting in the effort to enjoy the game. Player 2, if you are coming into the game expecting that you'll be able to do so so much, you wont. Just like player 1, they had to slowly and painstakingly put time into the game to get to the points you're complaining about.

I understand the one island per switch, but there's two reasons for this.
First, an island takes up a significant amount of space on your switch. With the addition of progression and adding items to your inventory, and your museum and encyclopedia, that all adds up. Then imagine every user on a switch, 8 users with their own individual islands, on top of that per user, 7 additional houses per shared island. That's a grand total of 8 unique islands, and 64 unique players. That amount of data adds up, quickly.

Secondly, adding onto the data situation. The game allows 8 users total on an island. If you're playing online, the max is 8 on your island total. Given the switch has a total of 8 users, its the best choice to make. One island per switch, one player per user.

To review bomb a game means you aren't taking time to understand and come to terms why the game is built like this.

Overall, in my opinion, the game is a 10. With future DLC, it'll bump it to an 11."
Antibomb,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Taking Animal Crossing to new heights. Yes, there are some limitations, like only having one island per switch. But the amazing gameplay offered here more than makes up for that. And let's be honest, this is not an evil Nintendo scheme to sell more consoles, it's a classic Nintendo limitation to make players play and have fun together. Which is actually working really well in my household."
ChrisLinen,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"So they disabled cloud saves even though I'm paying $20/year for that. Next, you can't have more than one island per console, so if me and my sister wanted separate islands, we would have to spend $360 dollars to buy an entire new Switch just to have 2 islands. Oh and don't forget that certain features of the game are only available to the player who created the island, so single player is broken for everyone except the island creator. Oh and they made it a lot harder to ""time travel"" in the game. On the 3ds animal crossing, I would set my game time 2 hours different because I like to play every morning at around 6:00 AM and my school starts at 8:00 AM. Everything important in the game happens at 8, so I just set the time so that when it's actually 6, the game thinks it's 8:00. Now it's harder to change the in-game time, so I literally cannot play the game because everything important happens while I am in school. Wow, Nintendo's first party games are getting so bad. The older ones like Smash, Mario Kart, BOTW, etc. were really good but Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion 3, and Mario Maker 2 are all really bad. Their online is absolutely screwed, I can't believe they make me pay $20 for a broken system. Don't buy this game."
gamerdad83,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"1 island per console is a fabricated limitation that destroys the experience.

Even IF you wanted to buy multiple copies of the game (think OG Pokemon Games with a single save file per cart) you could have a copy of Red and a copy of Blue for each person in the family to have their own adventure.

Which, while that model was worse than traditional game up to that time with 3 save slots per cartridge, it still allowed each person their own experience.

Imagine if in Pokemon Sword/Shield, another user could start a game but couldn't get to the wild area because Play 1 stopped playing at the first Pokemon center.  It would be ludicrous and unacceptable.

Alas, this was an eShop purchase and I cannot return it.

I would have liked this a lot more if all of the 8 accounts on a console had their own island and you could zoom out to see the whole area, think like the Hawaiian islands, so each switch could have its own archipelago."
nofx911,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Normally, I would give this game an 8 out of 10, but I can not believe Nintendo would allow a first person release that is so incredibly crippled. Against better judgement I decided to try the game knowing that there is only one island per switch (I have never played animal crossings games before so did not realize how annoying that would be). However, they made is worse since the person that creates the island holds everyone else back. I do not have time to play right now, but my son is home and he is essential stuck since I do not have time to play. Maybe I missed something or did not understand when setting everything up, but that for all companies to be that anti consumer I would have never guessed Nintendo. Just seems like a cash grab from a company that has one of the hottest systems ruining a game that would be very good otherwise."

Odande,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Nintendo did a really cool thing where the first player to make their character on your Switch is the ONLY player who actually has access to the entire game. I cannot give resources to Tom Nook for building upgrades or progress my town in any meaningful way. I cannot for the life of me understand why Nintendo thought that only 1/8 people should be the one to have access to all of the game leaving 7 other players with a demo version.

I was about to buy a freaking Switch Lite and ANOTHER copy of AC:NH  until I realized I can't transfer saves!!! Good moves Nintendo. Game is essentially unplayable unless the primary player is giving you a play by play update of EVERYTHING that's happening on their end and even then secondary players can't even give those resources to the NPC's that need them. This is basically like how in Sonic and Knuckles the person who plays Tails is just aimlessly flying around the level where as Sonic is the actual one who's really in control."
Hypercharge,"Mar 24, 2020",1,This is not a multiplayer game. It will likely become one when Nintendo figures out how to charge people another $60 for the functionality.
AlwayzB,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game in good faith. I don't want this to be a shallow ""review bomb"", but it is the only way, I feel, to get Nintendo's attention and get a genuine fix pushed forward.

An absolutely brilliant game with 1 unbelievable fatal flaw: Having multiple players on the same Switch gates features, progress, and quests from all but the 1st player to play. Not only is there only 1 island per console (a design feature that should have been abandoned in the industry back in 1996), but only the 1st player to start the save file is designated as ""Island Representative"". Only they may talk to Tom Nook every day for quests, get various crafting recipes that, as far as I can tell, are exclusive to them, only they can place the housing for new residents, start building the museum, and on and on.

It's such an unfathomable misstep in an otherwise brilliant game. It's an easy 10/10 if they fix this, and fix it right. First and foremost, allow every player to make island progress and decisions, designating each player as the Island Representative role. Secondly, please, allow for multiple Islands per console; 1 for each player account. The *only* reasonable explanation for this decision is to pressure consumers into buying not only multiple copies of the game, but multiple Switches entirely. This is unacceptable and downright predatory. If they're concerned of people cheating and having multiple islands to farm, people already Time Travel, so who cares?

Please, please, please. Do the right thing, fix these incredibly broken parts of your game, and let me love this game as it deserves to be loved."

You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible.

MaeBeaInTheWood,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"This new Animal Crossing shows everyone can make mistakes, or just decide they want to be EA. This is very much just a mix of Pocket Camp, Wild World, and New Leaf. The game has an overly-long tutorial before letting you do what you want. There is also the fact that parts of your island are completely locked because you don't have any bridges built at the start unlike other games, and it's a while before you build bridges or unlock the vaulting pole. Nintendo also shows their greed in wanting you to buy more Switch consoles, as it is not 1 island per Nintendo Switch user, it's 1 island per Nintendo Switch console. And the only way to get a new or second island is to delete your first. This game also excludes the character of the fan favorite and my personal favorite, Rover. He does not appear on the plane to the island to help you (instead that role is filled by Nook's little scouts), and he doesn't appear in the game at all. My only things to say in defense of this game is that for once the game lets you decide what your villager's appearance is instead of generating it with cryptic questions like the other games (and usually no matter what you answered for the questions, you didn't like how your villager looked). The other thing is that Tom Nook appears to be less greedy and more friendly. He has general interactions the way a peppy villager, or Isabelle, or one of the Ables would instead of constant badgering and pressuring you about money like he does in other games."
jbc1995,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Bought the game to play with my wife. First video game she's ever been stoked to play (she's pretty new to video games). I understand people's complaints about one island per Switch console and only the first player to register being in full control, but I've actually really liked it. It allows us to better work together on our objectives and communicate what we want to do. The ease of swapping who is the leader in less than 5 seconds makes it extremely easy to work together on many tasks and split resources evenly. Sure, improvements could be made on the system, but considering how incredible the rest of the game is, it's a minor inconvenience for us. Note that this is my own personal opinion and other people may strongly disagree, but I for one, absolutely love the game, and so does my wife!"

I can only progress up to wherever she currently is and if she progresses when I'm not home, then I don't get to see it at all. There's no reason to have to buy another Switch and game just to be able to do my own things. The single-player experience is ruined for me since I'm basically backseat riding her account.

FixAnimalCross,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"I’m changing my review to a flat 5. I feel a complete zero was unfair. To be fair I was angry and I still think rightfully so. However, the multiplayer issues aside this game brings back memories of playing on the GC when I was a kid. I think it’s by far the best installment since then. I’ve spent hours playing and it’s very relaxing, yet addictive. I hope they can patch the multiplayer issues though. We ended up restarting so my fiancée could have lead since she plays more. We lost all of our progress which was frustrating, but obviously we kept playing so they must have done something right. This game is bad for player 2.Animal crossing on the GC allowed for all for players to have the same power. In this one only the first islander can progress the island?? Are you kidding me?? How hard would it have been to at least allow the other players to donate items to Nook for the store?? Or let them put items in the construction boxes?? This game isn’t family friendly at all. This game turned out to be a rip off marketing scheme to get entire families to buy the game and switches just so they could progress their islands. The second player can’t even get all the DIY recipes. Ridiculous..."

Yes the multiplayer is a little lackluster but you all should just be glad it's even there! As far as I know all the other Animal Crossing games were single player. If you are a big Animal Crossing fan you'll love this game.
Lysol,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game is so good it got my wife excited to play it. I had to go buy her a switch but hey, I’ve wanted her to have her own for a while."
shradke,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"It's great fun (for one person per console), but some serious oversight regarding local multiplayer progression hampers the main point of such a communal video game experience. Simply allowing others to contribute to town building projects instead of locking them behind the main account holder would vastly improve the game. The fact that only one person can access the construction boxes for new resident plots is case-and-point of this poor design."
earchmnd,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Game is great, I literally can’t stop play it lol, the people purposely leaving horrible reviews over one or two things that can be changed with updates and ignoring everything good the game has to offer are simply being immature"
Bergein,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Amazing game. All the people review bombing are just entitled children don't let there review sway your decision to buy this awesome game.
XOMBIEkoala,"Mar 24, 2020",0,I share the game with my wife and because I am the second player I can do nothing to advance the game.
mirantiago,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"It is an AWESOME GAME, I'm playing with my girlfriend, all in the same island and we're loving it to pieces."
Radsidewinder,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Fantastic game! If I could rate it higher I would, improves upon previous animal crossing systems in every way. It's a ridiculously calming, stress free way to blow through multiple afternoons and the level of customization that eventually comes to your island is astounding!"
ACNH,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Don’t trust the people review bombing this game. It is fantastic!

The negative reviews are only focused on one small portion of the game regarding its multiplayer functionality. So instead of weighting all portions equal in the review they just give it a 0/10 because they’re upset. Animal Crossing has always been like this with one island/town per save. How they didn’t see this coming is beyond me."
DJTwinz,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Animal Crossing is a charming game that is a fantastic upgrade from previous entries in the series. The game is visually gorgeous and adds so many details and things to discover for players. In the game the player has many options to make the island THEIR OWN through the freedoms of placing anything outside to terraforming it to your liking. I’ve already put in almost 40 hours in and hope I can keep playing for a long time. While being limited to one island may seem terrible to many seeking their own islands on the same Switch Animal Crossing is meant to be a social expierence with friends and family members. Animal Crossing is also a large game for the Switch and as the switch stores user data on the console I’d imagine multiple islands would take a large amount of space without an SD card. I’ve enjoyed playing with my family and will continue loving this game that has so much passion and detail put into it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to relax or have fun.
Kolisk,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Objective improvement over all previous entries with many features fans have long been asking for.
Factotum,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I love the new Animal Crossing. You have always been made to share a town with others in your home, I don't understand the haters. Thumbs up from me."
hellaturbo,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"This otherwise wonderful game is hamstrung to the point of unplayability in a household by the fact that the first user controls the progress of the island. This would be fine if you could start multiple islands, but, surprise, Nintendo artificially capped each system at 1 island in a blatant attempt to sell more consoles.

Allow multiple islands or fix multiplayer, having both of these critical flaws completely ruins the local multiplayer."
sloop,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I made an account to say this.
I let my little sister play the game before me and am now stuck having put a good 10 hours into the game without being able to progress any farther.
Let me change who the damn resident representative is!
Fun game other than that but this is a game-breaking error."
RawserJr,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Un juego excelente,lleno de detalles,de cosas por hacer,algo sumamente adictivo por el cual a veces juegas horas y horas sin parar,sin duda uno de los mejores juegos de la decada,un excelente trabajo de Nintendo,me encantò."

glitch3s,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Why is it so slow? I shouldn't have to wait days to progress.

Also please fix the issue with only 1 player being able to progress on the island."
Snance444,"Mar 24, 2020",9,This is a great relaxing game. I love it. It is the perfect game to play while listening to podcasts or watching TV with family. I could see why it would be frustrating if you were playing with someone else on the same console though- which is why I took off a point.
DaddyDayCare,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Unreal that I’m stuck without a shovel because my wife was the first user on our switch.  Had no idea the first player on the island needed to progress first, should give some warning.  Love the game but this is a big eff up."
Thunderfish19,"Mar 24, 2020",10,It's a good game honestly. Lots of things to do and I really enjoy it. It's probably one of the more chill games I can play.
pinkoval,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Really upset that you can only have one island :( ruined the experience for my me and my girlfriend.
MasterRodent,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Only 1 island per switch is awful. This absolutely needs to be fixed.  Otherwise I like the game but this is a fatal flaw.
El__,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Been playing since the day of release and I have to say, it's a truly amazing game. There's new things to do everyday. The game is beautiful, graphics are amazing.
I specifically enjoy that the game takes a longer time than normal games to 'complete'. This makes it seem more worth it, you can play for longer without having nothing to do.
Regarding the multiplayer, I have tested playing via online and local play (not on the same switch) and the experience was really fun. Just as a notice to anyone who only has one switch, you can only have one island.
Gameplay is incredible. Costumization is amazing! Overall 10/10"
Zehe14,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"A great addition to the Animal Crossing game franchise. It’s very upsetting to see people give the game a zero because you can’t have your own island when sharing a switch. While I get this frustration I don’t think it’s a ploy for Nintendo to sell more switches. They’ve sold many already and previous animal crossing games have had this format. I don’t like it much either, but I’m the only one that uses my switch so I’m not affected. Also, seeing people say that this game has no direct story line....have you never played an animal crossing game?"
Nimron13,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Absolutely ridiculous how much limitations I have to deal with as a second player. If I buy a single player game for 60 bucks I expect to get the full content for every person that starts the game. Instead I can't progress the story in any way as the second player and I get way less items. The decision to limit it to one island per switch was greedy enough, but restricting the game for player 2 this much without mentioning it in any way is just terrible"
Dcmeta,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"This is an exceedingly polished, fun, soothing, creative, and deep game. It gives much of the satisfaction from growing and harvesting and collecting I got from **** Valley, but with a much lower challenge level, cuter graphics, and none of the anxiety. (I love **** Valley, so that's definitely not a knock on it)

There are some convoluted and annoying issues with the multiplayer, but nothing game-breaking, and it just came out so there's potential for them to be ironed out. Text communication is clunky and slow, it's not intuitive how to visit or be visited by friends, and I don't know why I can't place items when someone is visiting my island. But again, this is a great game, and these are minor quibbles."
OdinzSon916,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"First and best animal crossing by far, don't listen to the mad multiplayer people this game is amazing!"
Sanji_Kun,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"1 island per console it's like being in the 90's.

Nintendo ruined this game"
kit1508,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Purchased this game for the first time by recommendations for friends this could be a good shared game to play with my very young daughter. Unfortunately upon playing it it seems clear the game was not ever actually intended to support more than one person playing on the same switch and has serious design issues. Very disappointing. I had been so excited on first playing but now I'm just disappointed and will not be purchasing any further games from AC as it's clear they just want more money rather than caring about their customers.
Naiko,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Honestly the game is amazing, while i understand that the one island per console might bother some people, if you play couch coop can be a blast, there's also tons of trolls review-bombing the game instead of doing fair criticism also, but is hard to deny that it is the best Animal Crossing by far."
Moshimaster18,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"This game is good if you’re playing it by yourself on a single switch, but playing as part of a family on a single switch is horribly broken and crippled by Nintendo’s predatory business practices. I will be returning this game, as it is unplayable for anyone but the first person to make an account in our 5 person family."
Boottoloot,"Mar 24, 2020",0,If anyone has multi people who want to play this game DO NOT BUY. You can only have one island per switch. First player has full access to the game anyone else is limited.
NicolaLucy,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"This game is really disappointing, we waited nearly 8 Whole years hoping for a much better game than this! Even Happy Home Designer was a much better game than New Horizons!
Like why is there is no dating option? Let me marry my favorites Marshal and Isabelle already, even **** Valley got it right!
And what's with the mexican stuff in this game? This is supposed to be a game for the AC fans, not SJWs, it just makes no sense why they would include that trash in an AC game.
And lastly let us have multiple island on one console! I can't just use one island for my Tumblr posts, I need multiple!
This really won't be tolerated Nintendo, you treated Smash and Pokemon much better but still push the AC community aside. Would Not Recommend!"
ntmera,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"One island per Switch. Game is great otherwise, but deserving of a 0 for this one reason."

Sensey_DARJ,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Nunca me había comprado algún animal crossing y ahora con este que me costó encontrarlo físico por el virus en Coronado XD. Me a gusta bastante, es hora del súper farmeo, bien tranquilo y ya me voy porqué seguiré con este juego"
aka_Izzy,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I'm a first-timer with Animal Crossing and I am pleasantly surprised. The world is so charming and the game is designed to be explored at your own pace. Don't let the ""cuteness"" fool you. Underneath the whimsical appearance lies a brilliantly designed game... that's a whole lotta fun.

I can tell that time and care went into this title. It's in the details. Just because things aren't exploding on screen, doesn't mean there's less going on. The fun I am having has to do with the freedom to really design my own little Oasis. I usually shy away from design-driven games like Minecraft because I get bored very quickly... this however feels very different. There are goals to achieve and rewards to receive. The game gradually teaches you it's mechanics in a way that doesn't make me fatigued or bored- there's always something just around the corner to perk your interest.


I cannot believe the negative reviews this game has received. I'm hoping these are kids that are ""review bombing."" The reviews are so juvenile in composition and riddled with silly, subjective reasoning-- it can't be written by anyone older than 12 (no offense)."
Adamski64,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Bought this game only to play together with my SO but the restriction of only one main player is a bummer...
chimera1701,"Mar 24, 2020",10,10/10 - would maybe have put 9/10 if it wasn't for really angry fans butthurt over triviality
wabbadabbababba,"Mar 24, 2020",10,I love the game. It is very fun to play the co-op with friends. People are complaining theirs only one island per switch but that's ridiculous. That was said before the game came out and every animal crossing game works like that. Personally I wouldn't want one island per person as I like working together to make a great island.  Really the only complaints I have are in the co-op i wish things the follower picked up didn't go to the recycle bin and I wish more than one person could go to the mystery islands.
mf_uh_ROACH,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"The text can be lengthy and slow at times but it makes sense. Only one island per console is also a bummer but not worth dropping it that far down. It's an overall fun experience with cute characters, fun multiplayer, and cool options of what you can do in the game."
rivalplatinum,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is the game the world needed at this bleak point in history. The island is beautiful, the dialogue is charming, and it fulfills the needs I want from an Animal Crossing game. If you come into this franchise expecting dramatic quest plotlines, you will be disappointed. This is a game about sitting back, making friends and enjoying a quiet life. Animal Crossing New Horizons is not a game that can be binged if you want to get the full experience. It's something you play a little of a day. I look forward to continuing to enjoy my island one day at a time."
TheRealHighKing,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"It's a great visit back to the series. I guess I'm not too blasted away by the one island per switch because my wife and I have had our own for various other reasons and games long before this, and it's not like it was a secret before the game launched."
PloverLoverjr,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"So great game if you are the first player. However, if you are playing local multiplayer with your family the game is absolute trash. Everything in the game is progress locked behind the first player. Whoever came up with the Resident Representative idea has no idea what Animal Crossing should be.

Hopefully at some point Nintendo removes this so that all players can play the game equally."
jtodaone,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is everything Animal Crossing and more. Whether you want to have a calming experience, have fun time messing around with friends, grind for bells and collectables, or make an emotional connection with wholesome virtual animals, it will deliver a 10/10 experience.

This game makes you look forward to wake up in the next morning."
rcc10galaxy,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing made the impossible: surpass Animal Crossing New Leaf. This is the definitive game in the series. AMAZING!

Note: don't pay attention to the average mark, cause they are giving low averages with no sense."
LiMyeong,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Even if Co-op playing is a little awkward, this game is one of Nintendo's great games. It inherited the advantages of ACNL, and gave players a variety of consideration in terms of convenience."
Melodyneko,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Honestly my favorite game to come out in the past few years. It's especially nice amid this COVID-19 problem. Just going to my happy place.
transgenickow,"Mar 24, 2020",0,bad bad decision by Nintendo with the local multiplayer. wtf were they thinking?
Breb,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"The game is absolutely great, the only reason it has a lowish score is because the multiplayer is a little bad, but if one thing is wrong with a beautiful game it doesn't  mean it deserves a score of 0."
Terminalreality,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"I would love to give this a better score but sadly I can not do that with the current state of the game. I paid $60 for a game that only allows one person to play it. Whomever plays first, in my case my 6 year old daughter, is the only character able to progress farther into the game. Every account that plays after that has zero control over the game and is limited by the first players progress."
Yaspeechov,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Muy entretenido. Es verdad que tiene carencias, pero no son nada comparado a todo lo positivo.  Juego con mi esposa y nos divertimos por horas diariamente, y eso que es iniciando no me imagino en un par de semanas que tengamos todo desbloqueado"
Aramova,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"One island per system? Really? This is like owning a car and only one person can set the seats or radio.

Also the cloud backup system is, well, it isn't there. So when you do play with a household on switch and something happens to it, everyone loses everything."
Candidcatopud,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game is so calming and fun. People have been tanking the score because you can only have one island but tanking a score because of one little thing is petty. I greatly enjoyed the game and have no trouble sharing, since that's how the game is meant to be played."
afroweaboo,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Fix the game Nintendo. I bought it for me and my wife to enjoy i started the game first only to find out we have to share a single island. Annoying but no big deal. However, I then discovered that my wife cannot make any progress in the game on her own and make and executive decisions. I was cheated out of $60 and I am pissed. Fix it"
ValerieLyn,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"While the game is amazingly fun and I can't seem to put it down, whenever I find a bit of free time, there are quite a few things that kind of put a damper on it. - One island per console, as everyone else has complained about. - Not having a quick way to open/close your gates without having to go to your airport.
- Having to close your gates to visitors just to spend miles and bells on things at the kiosk.

There were a few other things but nothing too big."
Danbea,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"My bf started playing before me. No option to create my own island and being the 2nd player to start on a console ****. You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable."
Ratzfest,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I created an account to mention how great the game is, and also I paid attention to the fact that as soon as Nintendo talked about multiplayer they talked about one island per console. So I did not just run out to buy this not knowing what I was getting. The game is beautiful, and all the additions made to the game are fantastic, the crafting is great, the fact that you can modify the island is great, now that you are building everything yourself it feels like there is way more to do than the previous games, 10/10"
blinkme0,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Honest answer, my wife plays the game almost exclusively but i have enjoyed as well. Personally i disagree with the single island issue but comparing it to EA's egregious Lootboxes and scummy tactics i think is serious hyperbole. Its a genuinely fun sandbox game with a few flaws, it is not meant to have a deep complex narrative other than the one you make for yourselves. Please stop overreacting this is almost as bad and cringe as the astral chain and fire emblem review bombings. Lets discuss the issues like mature adults and try to get Nintendo to respond in kind, not scorched earth tactics we're better than this."
Pellejoman,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"El juego esta genial y el crafteo esta de lujo, ahora, me parece fatal que solo se pueda tener una isla por consola pero peor me parece que compartiendola solo el perfil principal pueda hacerla avanzar y el perfil secundario, como es mi caso, este limitado a ser un simple visitante sin opcion de hacer avances en la isla."
thevaulthunter,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"In relevance to all these 0s:
You could ALWAYS only have 1 town. This has been a thing in every multiplayer installment of Animal Crossing. Every single one. The point is to have multiple people COOPERATE on one island rather than compete. In any case, that is ONE facet of this game. That is one little thing. A majority of the gameplay is solo. If you went into this expecting something different, that's not at the fault of the game at all.

The fact that many cite the multiplayer as what makes this game a 0 out of 10 speaks LEVELS to how amazing it is. Imagine for example if someone hated how boring a game like Mario Maker is if you didn't have internet. That's what these complaints amount to.

Almost every system has been streamlined and made easier or expanded upon with the exception of one: Tools. Furniture can be obtained in many ways, now randomly dropping from balloons (rather than just specific items), being able to be crafted, being able to be bought with both bells and nook miles, given away by villagers, found in trees, gifted by special characters, and of course from friends. On top of this, an improved customization system allows for you to change the appearance of many items on the fly, and for those that allow custom designs, that system has been expanded in all senses of the word: pixel art is now smoothed out, making it less immersion breaking. You can store a myriad of designs rather than 16. You have absolute control over the palette you color with instead of presets.

Placing furniture is also a lot easier. Taking ideas from Pocket Camp and Happy Home Designer, furniture can be manipulated on a much smaller set of tiles than in previous games. A ""1 tile wide"" object can be placed on half tiles, for example. An overhead view can be utilized in homemaking to manipulate many objects at a time. Wall items can be placed anywhere on the wall, even vertically above each other. Light objects are now dynamic, allowing you to really set the mood of your home beyond just their color.

Furniture can of course, now be placed outside, meaning you have control over your entire town instead of simply your house and a small handful of monuments. This opens up the floodgates for a truly custom experience, and in a few weeks time, I am excited to visit the towns of strangers to see the creations they built.

Villagers have a lot more personality now. Each one will interact with the world around them and have their own tastes in furniture and clothing. While before, their personality amounted simply to what bit of dialog they spat out when greeting you at best (Sporty villager always talks about sports), this has been expanded into them actually having a preference for what furniture they want on the island, what things they want you to craft, what they give you. I had a villager give me a hat once and I wore it. In previous games, that would be the end of that exchange, but in New Horizons, later talking to the villager, he had thanked me for actually wearing his gift from days prior. They acknowledge what objects are made for now, you'll have them say ""I exercise with this kettle bell!"" or ""This wooden double bed is so comfortable to sleep in!"" rather than ""This is my favorite [insert furniture name here]"" over and over. You will find NPCs sleeping under trees, or reading a book with their glasses on, or dusting their home. It feels more alive.

Now, for the flaws. Kind of. New Horizons puts you in the role of a resident who just moved onto a deserted island, and you have to build up from there. Now, this is a very interesting experience starting out, and I actually love the idea of it. You gather materials to build your tools to build better things and unlock more decor or better tools, a la many survival games. The issue with it however is the late game. When you get to the end of Minecraft, Terraria, Ark, what have you, you have the best tools that almost never break. There are no equivalents thus far, the best tools are twice as good as the base tools, which isn't fantastic.

The next issue is 1 island, which while minor, is still an issue as with all the creative opportunity, you have but one canvas to work on. If you want two distinctly themed islands, you have to remove the first to do that, and it's a little heartbreaking.

Other than those two things however, the game improves on everything Animal Crossing, and I would recommend it to all Switch owners, and say it's a NECESSITY for any Animal Crossing player."
Robo72,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"I’ve always been a huge animal crossing fan as well as my mum, playing since Wild World. I have been so excited for this game for so long, which couldn’t have come at a better time btw. The game is visually amazing and there is so much more flexibility, more challenges and more to do. Placing items inside and outside, the crafting and customisation mechanic, choosing where villagers live, terraforming and waterscaping which are available later on are all unimaginably amazing features and really let you customise your island. Being able to play with 7 other friends is amazing, I have made huge use of this feature, having a large amount of friends who also play the game and this has enabled me to feel less isolated as well. I don’t understand why people complain about only being able to have one island, me and my mum have always had 2 characters on the same town and absolutely love it. We can customise ourselves and homes individually as well as sharing many experiences, such as working together to complete the museum donations etc and doing things for each other when the other is absent. The amazing thing now is that 2 people can play on one system at the same time, which is something we could never do before and I have absolutely loved doing this! People who say for 2 people in the same house to play together you need 2 switches, that’s simply not true at all. In the past this was true as you could only play one at a time and would need 2 3ds and local play, but now this is not needed as you can much more easily enjoy playing together as well as apart. People who leave 0/10 reviews obviously have no clue what they are talking about and can’t appreciate how great this game is and how many amazing editions have been made -crafting, customisation in seconds, placing everything where you want, changing your whole island layout, being able to pick up entire trees and move them, being able to expand your inventory, new hairstyles and facial features that you can change when you want much more flexible pro designs- can now make hoodies and different types of dresses etc and more!! The villagers are so much more lifelike as well. This gave is everything I wanted it to be and has really helped our family and my friends get though this difficult time and connect."
eelkonig,"Mar 24, 2020",10,People complaining about the one island per console thing forget that this is how Animal Crossing has literally always been. There’s never been an Animal Crossing game where you have more than one town on a single system. Why would they change that now?
numm,"Mar 24, 2020",0,If you’re not the primary profile the game is stripped-down “lite” version of itself.
theateremagine,"Mar 24, 2020",0,The fact that I cannot buy two different games at least to have a different island than the rest of my family is ridiculous. I wouldn’t mind sharing if it wasn’t so Only the First Player gets to upgrade things. It’s disgusting because I’ve been sitting with an underdeveloped island for days while my younger sibling got the favoritism of my parents so they were allowed to make the first character and now the villagers have been in tents for 5 days!!! All because they don’t want to play as often as they acted like they would. So now I’m stuck on an island with no stores because the First Relocater hasn’t supplied building materials. I’m about to lose my MIND. For the love of GOD at least change it so if I throw money at Nintendo and buy another copy of the game I can have a new island!!!!
Cornman8,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"The game is exceptional. It’s so much fun to build an island and watch it develop with each day. Every day there is something to do and goals to accomplish. Sure, the only having one island on one switch is annoying but not enough to detract from the game in a major way."
Jane29,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This is a beautiful, immersive game with so much to do. The graphics are gorgeous and the range of options and activities you have available to you is incredible. I love sharing an island with my family members. It's something we have done in every other installment in the series and is always a lot of fun!"
Robert_C,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Very fun and relaxing game, the design of the character are very nice, especially the animals like Tom Nook where you can even see the little fur instead of a simple color gradient, sure the game have its faults, but it is very accessible and everyone can enjoy it."
Crespalvaro,"Mar 24, 2020",4,"The game is amazing, beutifull and totally remmebers me my childhood. But this limitation that only main account can trigger main events. Im fine with having only one island, specially i bought the game to play with my girlfrind and i think its pretty good being able to be in the same island.

But in the other hand, not being able to experience full game with a secondary account... thats so bad, finally feel like farming materials for the main account, like, if the owner of this main account is not playing, you have to connec to his account to trigger new events and follow with the story. So bad and i complay because i cannot understand the reason behind"
torrezz,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Juego excelente, y muy adictivo!!! 100% recomendable, aún y cuando no hayas jugado las entregas anteriores"
dani3po,"Mar 24, 2020",1,Only one Island per console is a huge drawback for me. I expected more freedom from the series' debut on the Switch. I hope Nintendo solves this problem with a patch in the near future.
And27,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Made an account just to review this game to help raise awarness and hopefully get this fixed. The reason I say ""fixed"" is because it is unbelievable that this was the intention of the developers and Nintendo. The game is great as a single player experience, even sitting around watching my girlfriend play is a fun time and helping her out by grabbing the controller to help her progress.Everything changes though when you want to try having your own animal crossing experience on your account. The game locks you into one island per switch, so whatever creative descisions the first player made is stripped from the second **** cannot place buildings or structures, donate to the museum, or unlock more DIY tools or construction kits. You are locked by the progress of the first player, even though you are on a completely different profile. The only way out of this is to give Nintendo more money by purchasing a new Switch console. Yes thats right, want the full experience of this game for yourself but can't because someone started playing the game on the Switch first, for the mere price of a whole new console you can have that $60 on release game experience for only about 5x the cost of the game originally, thanks Nintendo, you have basically locked the gane into being a hard 1 game per console and advertising it as a fun multiplayer experience where everyone gets to help make an island together. Instead you have that experience for only one player and all the other accounts on your console are just along for the ride. No one should have to suffer a paywall this high, poor business practices and this game deserves every negative rating it gets until this is fixed. 0/10 a masterpiece only 1 person in your household can enjoy."
joethebro,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"0 out of 10 because I feel the game deserves a 0 out of 10, not because I'm trying to drag the user score down.

Only one person can fully play the game per switch, even if multiple people buy their own digital copies. Forcing people to share an island **** but forcing everyone else to be effectively NPCs in the game is the most blatantly anti-consumer thing I've ever seen in a video game. Out of every single offline game that has released on PS4, Xbox One, and Switch, this is the only one that cannot be played by multiple people."

FantasyHarmony,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"I’ve been playing Animal Crossing since the first game in the series and I’ve always loved it, and this one is amazing. The game does start slowly and it takes a bit of time to get all the features from other games, but I kinda like that, and if you want you can time travel to speed it up
If you’ve come here looking at reviews to see if you want to buy the game I suggest ignoring the people giving it 0, they’re review bombing the game and using a feature that was multiple times said to not exist. All the marketing through directs as well as press said there would only be one island per console. Now if you have kids or want to play with someone else I could see that being a deal breaker obviously, but when you see a 0 you know that the person is reviewing in bad faith. Especially when you “worse than EA” getting thrown in"
Katastrophic,"Mar 24, 2020",10,My literal only complaint is that I can’t craft in batches. This is a beautiful and amazing game for those of us who have played since the original. I understand frustrations for those who are playing this as their first Animal Crossing. I feel like most of the low reviews come from a lack of understanding of where the game comes from.
Frexter,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THIS SYSTEM TO TWEET THE DEVS AND NINTENDO.

I bought this game for my SO. She's currently stuck abroad, so I started playing first. Only to realise that when she comes back I'll have to delete my save in order for her to have the same new player experience I've had. Thus making all my time wasted. Not only that, but if we then proceeded to play together I would be severely limited as player 2.
To ask for $60 and an additional Switch to be allowed to have a second island is a disgusting practice and one I cannot support.
It is a shame because the single player experience is great. But until this is fixed, it does not deserve a higher rating than this."
QualityGame27,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Simple enough 10/10 if you live alone. 0/10 if you live with LITERALLY anyone else in your household. 1 island per console where whoever makes the account first is the only one able to progress, and everyone else is locked into their progression with no hope of escape except a 300 paywall of buying an entirely new console. Shameful that this even took place. Easily a 0/10 until fixed."
alan666,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Great game! The characters are so charming and loveable! I miss that Brewster is out, but other than that this game is such a huge improvement against New Leaf. I love New Horizons"
sky_visitor,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"One island per Switch is an anti-consumerist decision made in an attempt to boost hardware sales. My girlfriend and I are forced to share the same island, which isn't terrible in and of itself. However, as the first person to start the game I am designated the ""Resident Representative"". As the second player, she cannot progress the tutorial. She cannot make any decisions that shape the island. This is a half-baked experience for anybody other than the first player on the island. If your Resident Representative isn't as active as you, or even decides to stop playing the game, good luck! You'll never, ever progress past wherever they left off.

We are quite well off and could easily afford another Switch. We will never buy another Switch, because it is a CONSOLE and not a PERSONAL DEVICE like a cell phone.

Change the game to allow each profile to have their own island."
sarthek,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"In brief: it's impressive that Nintendo managed to create a family game that in no way caters for families.

The issues with the primary resident versus other players is are well documented, so I won't rehash them here. What's particularly disappointing is that anyone could have foreseen this: it's a family game and, given that there's only one island per Switch console, more than one person is likely to want to play it (unless you've got a very small family).

It would not have been difficult to allow players 2+ to contribute to things like building new houses, but instead they're just left out in the cold. In this particular case they can read the construction sign, but cannot see the requirements or provide materials without sending them to the primary player.

It makes a certain sort of sense to only allow one person to make significant modifications to the island, but even then it would not be a particularly big ask to allow the primary player to grant the rights to players 2+.

Similarly, resources like rocks are relatively limited and are handled on a per-island basis: that is, if one player harvests the rock (by hitting it with a shovel - you can get up to eight items per rock without destroying it) no other player can harvest that rock the same day. Because of this, sharing resources between two people is challenging – three or more must be a nightmare.

Nook points to get tickets to semi-random islands to harvest are a partial solution, but the rate at which one can gather Nook points slows rapidly as you progress through the game to the point where this looks like it's going to cease to be viable very soon (5-6 days into the game).

Overall I'm really, really disappointed and I generally expect a lot more from Nintendo when it comes to games that can be played by the whole family. I'm not sure what Nintendo's goal here is; perhaps that we should have a Switch AND copy of the game per member of the household? If so, that's a losing bet, for sure."

Zalabar22,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"While no master piece, this game is still a fantastic entry in the AC series. While it starts slow, overtime it introduces new concepts and QOL improvements that fans have requested for multiple entries. It also has limitless gameplay potential which means you can rack up a ton of hours without really trying. Some of the local options and shoddy changes hold this game back from a perfect score however, but this game is definitely worth the price of admission. The graphics are iconic and crisp and every song in the soundtrack is worth listening to. I'm only about 15 hours in, but I've seen what the game has to offer towards endgame and can't wait to build my deserted island into a bustling village! 8.5/10"
Supah,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Seeing animal crossing in HD is amazing! Having to build everything from the ground up makes you even more eager to unlock everything. And the addition of nookmiles, that you are given for everyday tasks, makes the game even more addicting to play! As a former new leaf and wild world player I would definitely recommend this game."
The_Shed,"Mar 24, 2020",4,"As a solo player? 9/10. Tremendous game, beautifully polished and fun to play. Plus relaxing during a huge outbreak.

As a collaborative/co-op player? With multiple people/friends/family sharing a Nintendo Switch and collaborating on an island? Terribly flawed. Completely hobbled by the awful decision to only allow ONE main character (the first person to begin the island). All other people/characters on the Nintendo Switch console who join the island are blocked from core story content, from progressing the island, and from unlocking recipes. They are essentially ""guest"" characters, for temporary and throwaway use.

This is not communicated anywhere in the game, so it's possible to go weeks or months building your island before realising that when your flatmate or sibling leaves/moves out, you will be completely blocked from progressing because they were the ""main"" villager.

Absurd, terrible design decision."
T_hallthe1st,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Fix the multiplayer!

ejihog,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"The problem with New Horizons is not in the game itself, but with people who didn’t really understand what Animal Crossing is."
Megsterrz,"Mar 24, 2020",6,"This is a rather early on review, as I have been playing for 4 days and I'm sure a lot is subject to change. There are a lot of great improvements from older versions of the game, but unfortunately a lot is lacking, which takes away from the overall gameplay. I will not be focusing on the multiplayer aspect, as I am playing alone on my Switch, and am not encountering problems, though I can totally understand the frustration of those who have to share a console/island. The game is built unfairly for those people.

The game does not have hourly music, which is something previous Animal Crossing games are known for. I miss having quirky, hourly tracks, but the backtrack gets repetitive very quickly. The objective based system is a nice touch, but unfortunately doesn't feel rewarding, and does not lead to any larger objective. Gyroids also are not present in the game, and I REALLY hope they come out with an update.

The game has a slow paced system, which is OK and echoes the Animal Crossing feel, but the delay of introducing characters/villagers/buildings/etc leads to a heavy lack in content. Who knows, maybe they weren't expecting people to have so much time due to the Corona lockdown! I am a bit disappointed that I'm already starting to feel bored after 4 days, especially when the game has been in the making for such a long amount of time.

I'm hoping a lot of these problems will be ""fixed"" by either playing the game for a longer period of time, or updates. I'm hoping Nintendo will not push heavy paid DLC packages for this game..."
aaronagius,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"Despite people pointing out the obvious flaws, which is that only one island per system can be created, despite being a feature that has ALWAYS existed in Animal Crossing even on home consoles, this game is a great addition to the already amazing series."
Joleonel2,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Eate videojuego es excelente en todos los sentidos. Pero claro no es perfecto, ningún videojuego es perfecto. En mi opinión tiene un solo inconveniente, el no tener la posibilidad de hacer dos islas por consola pero esto no es motivo para ponerle un 4 o un 0 de nota como están haciendo muchos usuarios de metacritic utilizando las review bomba para desprestigiar un videojuego o compañía. El videojuego es excelente y se lo recomiendo a todos los usuarios de metacritic. A los que estéis leyendo esto y no estéis seguros si comprarlo o no yo os pido que le deis una oportunidad. A metacritic le pido que elimine las review bomba que están desprestigiando al título y afectando a la compañía que lo a creado y a los propios usuarios de metacritic. Y por último a los que escribís estas reviews bomba os pido que primero, os compréis el juego y segundo, que valoréis el juego por sus puntos positivos y negativos si no sois capaces de hacer eso, no escribáis reviews en metacritic o si realmente se os da tan bien hacer comentarios negativos a algunos videojuegos, espero que también seáis capaces de criticar con la misma intensidad vuestros videojuegos favoritos aunque estoy seguro que no lo haréis."
GabOSv2,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Friendly, a nice online system. Everyday you'll find something new. The crsfting look so great"
Pictogeist,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I was very excited to play this game. Animal crusting is a great series and the island concept sounded really fun. Sadly, the game progresses very quickly and they throw out the entire deserted island concept within the first day. I went from camping in a tent to having a house in about 4 hours. It feels like I'm going to have done everything there is to do within a month.
And that doesn't even touch on the multiplayer nonsense. You're limited to one island per console, so player two doesn't get a full experience. Player 1 controls the island, every other player is just a permanent visitor with very little control. If I hadn't started the game the same day as my girlfriend and waited a week or so to start playing, I'd be dropped in a ""deserted island"" full of houses, people, and businesses.

Don't bother buying unless you plan to be the only one playing."
Dunnel,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Only one player per console can truly experience this game. If you’re thinking of buying it as a couple to run an island together, don’t. Only one of you will get to make the decisions. While you can always communicate this outside the game, you can’t even help contribute in game. If you aren’t the “island representative” you are treated no differently to other NPCs."
DaRon_83,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"While the game itself is beautifully designed and cute looking and you get lots of motivations from what you can do. There are some design aspects and restrictions that are not worth to play the **** least if you are more than one player.

1st critics: the menu design. If you want to buy, craft, build or sell things or just interact with objects and NPC, you have to click through the same procedures over and over and over and over again. You can´t just simply shortcut actions when done once. You can´t just hand over animals to the museum in a pack. You can´t just skip menus. No, you need to do this one after another and always go through the same question and answer procedures every time again and again. That is nonsense and game design from 1990.

2nd critics: Nintendo linked one island to the hardware and that´s it, no matter how much accounts are on the Switch. At all, Nintendo should have given the option if you want to live together on one island or everybody have its own. But being forced to live on one island is just stupid. Nintendo agued that it´s for protect against cheating. But why the **** do you do this? There´s no competition in the game. When people want to cheat, let them cheat if it´s part of their game experience. Are you the mother of all gamers?

3nd critics: it´s the worst of all and a reason to sell the game. Nintendo decided to give the full game experience just to the player who initiated the game first. HOW STUPID IS THAT. Everybody else on the Switch is not just being forced to live on the same island. NO. They can´t even do all the things that the starter account can do. Every other account on the Switch is downgraded to a worthless peasant of the leading player. Being restricted to do basic things, but not being allowed to change major stuff on the island like create buildings, modulate the terrain or doing any important action to develop the island further. Just the leading player can do that.

Nintendo, that´s the most stupid game design I´ve ever experienced in my whole gaming career of 25 years. You are forcing families with just one console to devide into one major player and everybody else being peasant players. For a NON-COMPETETIVE game that was designed to player FREE and LIKE THE PLAYER WANTS IT TO EXPERIENCE on a FAMILY CONSOLE, you ****ing idiots.

No Nintendo, you designed the game to experience it the way you want and sell more consoles. That´s it."
solidzone,"Mar 24, 2020",3,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great game. Honestly, it's very good so far.

However, I'm giving this game a bad score because of the mangled couch co-op / multiple profile experience. The first profile to start the game becomes the Resident Representative. This is the only player who is able to further progress the story / quests. The second player is merely a glorified island resident. Why did Nintendo decide to not let me, the second player, place homes, help with tasks or even get the same recipes as the first player?

Here's a list of what I'm not able to do:
- I do not get the same DIY recipes (this includes things like the axe, shovel, etc. Essential tools!)
- I am not asked to help upgrade the island
- I am not invited to participate in new projects
- I cannot help my girlfriend with her own island projects
- I am not even allowed to check in-progress projects to see what resources are needed.

Tom Nook literally tells me to ask my girlfriend what she needs.

The multiple profile experience has been absolutely horrid so far and managed to seriously impact how my girlfriend and I play this game together. We were very excited about this game and were ultimately let down. Thanks, Nintendo."
juvell,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"The single player looks great, however as the second player to start playing on this console, this game is a waste of time and energy. Until the co-op is fixed I can't imagine ever being able to enjoy this game, as I'm essentially just an NPC."
Herrindhal,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"It is my first animal crossing and i am enjowing it a lot, I am doing every single thing i can do and that's a lot of thinks also the collect of all bugs, fishes and fossils is one of my favourite entertiments.
I can understand why people are annoyed by the fact that is only one island per switch, but is a nice coop too, for people who share island, to build it together, i am doing it with my little brother and we talk about what happens to one or another in the island. Althrough only I am the founder of the island, he can do the same things than me, so is the same gameplay for us both.
The art, as music, graphics and gameplay looks good, it just feels the way it must, I think, but there are things that could be better, for example at buying many things, i would like to buy 31 thibgs for examole, instead of doing it in packs of 5, or individually.
In general i am enjoying this game a lot, but it's not perfect, so almost 10 for me."
suisenceirw,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Great game; I just wish you could have multiple islands. I can just play the game for hours, doing nothing without getting bored."
mattchew1993,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"The fact that second profiles are limited complete break what was otherwise a good game. As someone who bought this as their first AC game, it should be reasonable to expect that different profiles will get the same experience - at the very least they should explain this at the beginning of the game and let you transfer who is representative at will. We're quarantined and I'm still working 8+ hours from home while my girlfriend is laid off due to COVID-19. Now she can't progress until I make time."
Team_potatoe,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"My girlfriend and I were so excited about this game. She got to play it first because I had the flu when our preorder shipped. She said she was having so much fun and I was so excited to play it. When I was finally able to play it, I found out that I don’t matter as a player in the game. Nothing I do matters, I can’t progress the island, and there is no point in me even playing. Like, come one man, I don’t have the money to buy a whole new switch just so I can enjoy a game too. It’s ridiculous. Why is it so hard to make a game that 2 people can enjoy, either simultaneously or on the same console?"
Exile20,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Nintendo is forcing people to buy two switches and two games. They put in blockers to make the second player feel frustrated. There is limited things the second player can do it is makes for a bad experience.

orielveil,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"This game is fantastic and beautiful. The only thing I would change is incorporating the ability for multiple users on the console to find materials needed for larger projects and drop them off at the project which was a feature in new leaf. You can access everything the main account can by looking in the second page of Tommy and Timmy's store. This game is great.

These games have always only had one island per console."
Rase,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"El juego en sí es fantástico, como todos los animal crossing. Este viene cargado de novedades, como el crafteo de muebles y herramientas, y la personalización. El problema de este viene con el multijugador y la imposibilidad de tener más de una isla por consola. No es justo que si somos dos usuarios que la usamos, solo tengamos una isla, y uno sea el que hace todo y decide, y el otro solo pueda hacer el resto de cosas.

También estaría bien poder tener dos islas aun siendo un jugador, para poder experimentar más con la construcción del terreno que te permite, o probar los distintos tipos de islas. No entiendo porque Nintendo puede haber hecho algo así, que solo limita la experiencia final. La única explicación es para vender más consolas y juegos.."
Sanderfowl,"Mar 24, 2020",2,"In line with other reviews, i just discovered that the first player obtains MAJOR benefits over the second/third players etc. While i do love the idea of building an island together with other players, what options do second players get to build? They don't get invited to:

- get new DIY recipes for welcoming new villagers;
- help upgrade the island;
- participate in new projects.

Understandably, everybody but the first player is losing interest. All they can do is mine resources, after all.. Can this be fixed? I would love for other players to:

- Receive the same DIY recipes for new villagers;
- Actually being able to contribute to setting up housing for these new villagers."
Barbolanero,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Let's begin by being extremely clear: this game is amazing. It deserves all the praise you've heard about it. It's fun, it's innovative for the series, it's really zen and, most importantly, it still conveys that sense of belonging to a community when playing.
You probably are also reading a lot of angry people saying that the game only allows one island per Switch console, and not per Switch user. That is correct. I agree with those people that this should not be the case. And while I can see it being an issue if you have multiple kids and or other people in your household that want to play different islands, I don't think that fact alone makes it deserve a bad score. Since that's about the only thing you'll read in the negative reviews.

What things do I like about the game:
-Graphics are gorgeous and cute
-It's fun and adorable
-It really helps out relieve anxiety}
-It has steps taken into making sure other people can't destroy your island with the Best Friends system

What things I don't like about it:
-The multiplayer is a bit strange, specially to connect online to other people (but not a whole lot of an issue either)
-The 1 island per switch is not ideal

All in all, this is a 10/10 game. If you're the one player in your household, go for it. If you share the switch with someone else, maybe do a bit of research first and see if the restrictions are good or bad for your particular case."
AlicesGun,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Don't buy this game if you have more people playing on one Switch. It is a good Game for the first Player that enters the game, but the next player that wants to start the game is strictly limited in his gameplay."

Terribly abusive."
Burpy,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"New horizons has everything that made new leaf great, and then some. Its cute, fun, addicting, and charming.

IggyZW,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Bought to ply with my girlfriend, we cannot have our own island, the first who starts play becomes the main character. Any other players that begins a new game will becom A SECONDARY CHARACTER, this means that he will gets a ""lite"" version of the game which don't let you to do the main questline, to build things, to have main recipes. Actually you can only catch bugs and fish. Any other game lets you have distinct save games for account (even Pokemon, and all of you know how this is strange), this is not the case of animal crossing that, if you want to play with your own island you have to BUY ANOTHER SWITCH.
You have to fix this as soon as possible."

barbiemancosu,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Bought the game to play it with my BF, he started to play first and now i can't play as a normal character. What happened is that the fact that i play it after him made me a secondary player. This means that i cannot follow the main questline, that i cannot have some base items (such as axe, for example) and that i can't participate in any of the changes that could be made if this was my own island. So, every other games lets you have your own savegame, so every account has a personal game, this is not the case; in animal crossing, if you want to have your own game (in an home console such as it is) you have to buy another switch (250 bucks). Thank you nintendo for not letting me play the game as a normal player. You have to fix this asap because we can't have to talk of this ridicolous design choice in 2020."
NeoAspect,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Incredible game and a must buy. Those giving it low scores are being petty and nitpicky over the smallest things. By far the most wonderful game ever to come out of the animal crossing franchise!
Blathers,"Mar 24, 2020",0,1 Island per switch and all progression limited to the 1st player - desperate cash grab from nintendo to encourage you to buy a 2nd switch. This is very disappointing given they marketed the game with a strong social element. Local coop element is also pointless with player 2 being unable to do most things.
ChrisWhiteWolf,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"The game is currently broken and does not allow you to make amy progress whatsoever if you're not the first person to open the game.

So if you try to open the game on your profile after someone already did, the game forces you to play on someone else's island and you can't do anything at all. Just run around catching sih, bugs and shaking trees for eternity."

We Don't Give A **** About Your Experience) but that would not attract so many players I think.

Yes, this is a review-bomb, because the whole point of the game was to play it with my girlfriend and the one thing the game prevents you from doing is to play it with other person (except local coop, but that's not what I'm looking for).

Besides that - the game is cute and addictive but comparing it to **** Valley which I just saw my girlfriend playing this lacks the depth and content of SV. Might be wrong though, I'm only day 4."
SmartAlec512,"Mar 24, 2020",9,I've played it for 2 days now and I already love the game. This game truly is amazing.
Elm0_0,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Amazing game! there is no rush in playing at all, there are many things to do, by yourself and with friends. It’s a game that can be played at times when you have nothing else to do and just sit down and catch some fish.

The game never makes you feel like you need to play or need to stop playing, it helps you to not be bored."
prope,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Sharing the game I am basically *shadowing* player 1, I am only a guest in someone's island and this is ridiculous because I also paid for this game!
I cannot trigger any events no matter how many hours I play it, I will never go beyond what is achieved by the player 1; and I have to pay for everything that player 1 gets for free!
NO ONE told us about this before buying this game ! we only knew that we have to share an island, which I thought is weird but manageable if you are smart about using the resources. And according to Nintendo it is supposed to be ""up to 8 persons multiplayer game"". Well it is not!! and i want a refund."
FF777,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I have 4 young kids and they are very good about sharing the switch we have, and they were excited about animal crossing coming out.. I like the switch's ability to have separate saves per account so that each kid can go through the games on their own..
We pre-ordered animal crossing and were excited about its release.. Well, come to find out, you can only have a single island *per switch*!! The island is shared by all the accounts! And further more, only the creator of the island can advance the plot or do any major stuff!
The kids are majorly disappointed, and it's not like i can buy 4 more switches for all 5 of us just for one game! This just ruins the entire game from the start, and there is no good reason not to have an island per account instead of per switch.. Even if we hypothetically bought 5 copies of the game, it would still only let you play one single island.. The only solution would be for me to buy 4 more switches, which is insane.. Please fix this nintendo!!"
ASlothGoneWild,"Mar 24, 2020",0,Doesn't let you play with multiple accounts like advertised. Let my boyfriend play for a bit before I got home because he was curious what the game was about only to find out I couldn't even then play the game I payed for! Absolutely disgracefully and deceitful.  Sent in a ticket and it was closed saying that is  how it is designed to be and to buy another console and game if we both want to play.... Game is not worth almost $300!!! I regret spending even $60 on it!
SchroDingerzat,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I don't like leaving bad reviews like this, but it's the only option for me as a consumer. The 1 island restriction is trash and far worse than previous games. The second player has an overall worse experience with many features locked out from them, and unlike previous games this is not solved by simply buying a new memory card or a second game cart. This is not consumer friendly and forces players in the same household to buy multiple Switches if they want the full experience. At least in New Leaf you can transfer your house as the second player if you wanted to be the mayor of your own town, such a feature is not possible here. To add insult to injury the lack of real Cloud Saves is a joke, especially when it's a service we pay extra for. A first party service like Cloud Saves should be compatible with all first party games."
DaveNg,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"We were promised a game that let a family build an island together.  That's a giant load.  Truth is that only one player, and one player EVER is allowed to do anything on the island.  Everyone else gets to watch with the chore of following them around the island.  You can't build shops.  You can't build museums.  You can't build bridges.  You can't build houses for new villagers.

You can't even help player 1 do any of those things.

I didn't get the game I was promised.  Not even close."
ZeroArmada,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"Great game, they improved about all the aspects of classic animal crossing, graphics are amazing and quirky, it's incredibly relaxing to play. Must buy!"
Denielsv,"Mar 24, 2020",0,One switch - one island = 0 copies bought. I'm not buying another console just to play with my girlfriend so we both have the full game experience. It's anti-consumer practice.
zac280,"Mar 24, 2020",1,"Multiplayer is badly broken. I bought this game to play with my two kids, but unless we're signed in with the first player's profile the story won't progress. The game doesn't make this clear to you at all so you end up spinning your wheels for hours until you Google the issue. This feels like a greedy move by Nintendo to restrict sharing so badly that another switch and copy of the game are necessary."
Lauren9796,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"If you share your switch and was excited to both play this game, think again. Understandable that you share worlds but as a second player u cannot access the entire game, certain VITAL tools (think shovel and axe???) and upgrades are unavailable, u can't contribute to quests or even upgrade from a tent to a house ????? What the **** Nintendo. Give us the option of 2 islands or at least send DIY packs to the 2nd player so they can play a as well and upgrade their house ???? This is crap. Will have to buy a second switch so we can both **** ****ed."
ImRavs,"Mar 23, 2020",8,"Although the game has only been out for three days so far, I can thoroughly say this has brought me so much joy. As a long time fan I can say this is a very faithful and innovative title in the series. The big pros introduced in this game that I see clearly are the introduction of crafting, innovations to both indoor decorating and new outdoor decoration, and freedom to build your town how you like it with the moment of buildings introduced. There are many other pros too, such as character customization, the beauty of the game (especially seen in the museum), etc. However, the game does have flaws. The tool degradation feels like complete annoyance rather than sense of progression and challenge it should, which is only worsened by the crafting system lacking depth due to the only 8 or so crafting  materials ever used. This makes it feel very monotonous to craft things, as it would require more resources than your small island can provide, which leads you to go to other islands (Using Nook Ticket) to get resources, which can become very tedious and somewhat too easy after your first few times. The game’s pacing feels extremely slow compared to other Animal Crossing games, which does hurt when you are so limited in the beginning. Other criticisms such as it lacking gyroids (present since AC:Population Growing) being missing, a somewhat lacking roster of new villagers, fish and bugs feeling too easy to catch now, and the dreaded 1 island per console issue do bring the game down however. One criticism I don’t believe is valid is the introduction of holidays through updates, as they would be added by the time normal players would get there thus the only people who would complain is the time travelers, which is debatable if that’s cheating or not. Overall, I believe this is a great evolution of the animal crossing formula, with many small flaws that are common across franchises when such a large gap is between entries which is to be expected. I would recommend this game to any previous Animal Crossing fan and anyone wanting to come into the franchise for the first time."
sorrygamer,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Got the game for my partner and I to enjoy in quarantine and am heartbroken over the restrictions placed on the second player. Sharing one island is fine and cool but additional players not following the same progression and not having access to all the game’s mechanics is TERRIBLE.

This has to be fixed."
donquijote,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"The sheer greed on Nintendos part is amazing. After paying 300 for the console + 60 for the game, you realize that you cant play with multiple islands per console. Not per save, not per game, per console. Per 300 dollar console. There is frankly no excuse on Nintendos part, except pure greed, and it is a shame, since it runs contrary to everything Animal Crossing stood for. And before you say, ""its part of their artistic vision"", I agree, it I$ a p$rt of the$r $rtist$c vision."
Spowell91,"Mar 23, 2020",2,"This game has some great elements and it is a lot of fun for the FIRST player to boot it up. For every other user who shares the switch console you are given a sub par experience. Only the first player to start the game gets to experience the whole game, complete with building shops, completing tasks for Nook, moving buildings, unlocking recipes, and generally continuing the storyline. Everyone else does not even get to help donate resources to building projects so their ability to progress in the game is limited by how much the primary player has unlocked. Nintendo is basically trying to force households to buy multiple consoles and multiple copies of the game as that is the only way for everyone to get the full experience!
The island also does not have enough resources to go around when you have to share those resources with everyone else in your household who plays the game. It can easily create tension and arguments as players fight over the valuable resources like iron that are in limited supply but are needed for crafting. I love the animal crossing series and was really looking forward to this game, but since my husband happened to log on first, I do not get to experience the game as it is meant to be. I am so frustrated that Nintendo would limit us with this one island per console garbage!"
Onokoko,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Only the first person to create a character can play the full game. All subsequent characters are inhabitants of the first person's island, and they cannot do anything progress related. My partner and I are both gamers and are very angry that only one of us can have the full experience, without shelling out $200 on another console. It is like the rest of the family is stuck shadowing while one person actually plays the game. Big let down - I was hoping this would be something cute and fun to entertain the family, but it is stressing everyone out."
figolo,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"Best entry in the series to date! Get it now! Don't even think about it! I began playing it 4 days ago and haven't stopped. The quarantine is real where I live and all I get to do all day is play this game! Believe me when I tell you it's really good. It starts off a little slow but you'll get the hang of it in a few days. Eventually you'll have so much to do and see! A quick tip: DON'T TIME SKIP!!

MASTERPIECE"
jtsmagic,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Terrible decision here by Nintendo to force users to buy multiple Switches and games just to be able to fully play the game when there may be multiple players in a household. As it stands, only the first person that logs in on the same switch gets the full version of the game."
sotdp405,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Very limited for households with multiple players. No option to create your own island and being the 2nd player to start means you miss out on most of the story parts of the game, and you have to wait for the 1st player to progress things before you can really do anything. It's a bit ridiculous and comes across as a money grab from nintento, trying to get people to buy multiple switch consoles and games per house. Very disappointing"
Hallux,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Completely ruined a social game.  Got this to play with my girlfriend but Nintendo has locked it to one island per consul. This would be ok if the players could equally share an island but they can't.  Anyone playing after the initial log in is essentially a glorified villager.  They cant make major decisions, participate in village projects,  or get story related crafting plans. All progress is gated by the first player.  Essentially this is a $360 dollar game as the only way to play together is to have a separate copy and a second switch.  Clear greed and money grab by Nintendo."
Perfectstrc,"Mar 23, 2020",4,"I tough Nintendo was a family console, I was wrong. Terrible to play with wife and children, main player get to do everything."
InTheMood,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"Love this game! It has a lot more features than New Leaf, and really keeps you busy the whole time. Be warned that you can only have one island per Switch, and the first player account to play gets more tasks to do. I don’t see this as an issue though because New Leaf only had one mayor per town... so it seems fine to me. People poorly reviewing the game are just mad that they would have to have multiple switches in order to have multiple islands."
Nando2k2,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"You better hope you’re the only one playing it. Any other users, that don’t play it first, have access to LIMITED resources. I started the game and now my girlfriend, who plays it more than I do, is bummed because she doesn’t have access to certain things that I’m only able to have access to, ONLY because I started the game first. I understand the one island per switch, but when you start taking access away to other users who want to play the game, within the same household, is unacceptable. Buying another switch for another user to gain full access to features, is unacceptable. Nintendo, get your stuff together and release a patch to fix this."
StarLard,"Mar 23, 2020",2,"Terrible value for $360. Why $360 and not $60? Because the game is effectively good for one person per console, so if you expect to get the full experience of the game (which I'm sure you do), you'll need to buy one Switch per player. Yup, one Switch per player. For some god awful reason, Nintendo decided it was reasonable to ship the game in a state where only user per Switch gets to play the full game.

Don't want to shell out $300 for another Switch per player? Then you can look forward to being constantly gated by the primary player's progress at every turn, having zero role in building out your island and its residents, missing all the major story moments (unless you use the equally awful local coop mode, more on that below), and having to buy all the tools and recipes the primary player gets for free.

Planning on only playing together using local coop? That helps with not missing out on the story beats, but expect all but the ""leader"" player to be little more than a glorified spectator. ""Follower"" players cannot talk to villagers, access their inventory, pick things up without a long animation for each item, choose where to go, enter/exit buildings, use the tool belt, and worst of all: only the leader will receive any of the quest rewards or world drops.

The game still gets a two star from as I'm sure playing as the primary or sole player is still very fun. To anyone like me who was looking forward to playing this on a shared console: Be warned, you're getting a fraction of the content."
steve_kent99,"Mar 23, 2020",7,"Addictive and fun but a serious drawback is the 1 island limit, just disappointing to see at this point."
Yunichi,"Mar 23, 2020",9,Its my 1st AC...maybe im too old for **** a great waste of my time...millions will love playin **** a highly polished nintendo **** the haters be haters...doesnt change the fact that every honest reviewer has to give atleast a 8/10...i will have fun with AC for a long time
actualgamer,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"to start, this game is terrific. for a single person playing on a switch console, its amazing. the graphics are beautiful, its creative, wholesome, cute and so much more. however.... as a couple or a family that shares a switch, this game ends up being extremely disappointing. such a bummer, and it makes me sad !!! the first player to create the island is given the role of representative. they can develop the island, place buildings, control the growth of the island, and overall have a meaningful contribution to the game. but everyone playing after the representative has been chosen, is forced to basically be an observer. they cant share in the same goals and fulfillment that the representative can. now theyre left out. you have one person the best game of the year, and the 2-4 extra players just watching the progression of the game without being able to contribute.  this could be fixed by just letting multiple people be the representatives of the island, or just letting us create our own profiles with our own islands. either way this could be much more fair. but instead, its just disappointing."
Animaldisappoin,"Mar 23, 2020",4,"The 2 players experience is terrible. I would recommand this game to a person with no friends, or family."
Scribblette,"Mar 23, 2020",0,One island per console for all local profiles. Progress locked to the first local profile to start the game. No warnings of any of this. Everyone else is a second class citizen who can't play independently whatsoever. Full price disappointment. Local co op totally gimped and basic features not available to second player. Reviewers should not have missed this. Shows how little video game journalists actually do their own research nowadays.
unfortunayt,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"my first ac game; i do not regret.

video reviews can be a little biased bc of the popularity of ACNL, but it is a genuinely fun game to play. it should be noted more clearly that only one island can be created on a switch & that the community can be a bit toxic, as most communities are, for the way you choose to play the game. As of the time i'm writing this review (a few days after launch), there is a dupe glitch going around that has completely ruined the online trading market. i suspect this'll be patched relatively soon and hopefully the market will level out again soon after. the game itself is very fun to play & very addictive. luckily for me, i didn't run into the island limit problem. if you're the primary owner of your switch, and don't plan on letting others use it, this game is a must have. right up there with Super Mario Odyssey & Breath of the Wild."
moomoozain,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"I don't understand why people are giving this game a 0 because of the lack of a feature that Nintendo said would not be in the game previously and that was not in any previous Animal Crossing games. I can understand that it can be bad for families that share a switch, but you shouldn't expect a feature that was denied by the creators of the game. Also, you shouldn't disregard the rest of the entire game and give it a 0 for one reason, you should still base your review on the other parts of the game, too.

As for my review, I obviously can't say how good the entire game is based on my 3 days (unless I time travel), but it's been amazing from what I play. There's just so much to do, and I never find myself feeling like I did all I could for the day. There are also so many things that make the quality of life so much better. Some of these are simple things, like items automatically stacking or bells automatically going into your wallet, but there are also larger changes like the tool wheel. The game is also a lot easier to play for longer periods of time compared to New Leaf because it's not on a tiny 480p screen (not to discredit New Leaf, that is also a great game). Overall, I can't say how good the full game is, but I can definitely give it a 10 based on the 3 days I've played through."

425_Flex,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Just like every other recent reviewer giving it a negative score... Nintendo made a selfish call locking only one user to be in Control of the only island. This is unacceptable of a family oriented platform. So for Evey family that has multiple kids or users, each one would have to own their own switch in order to have their own island and gather their own resources. What a scam. Before writing this review I gave Nintendo a 1/10 but now I'm all fired up thinking of how much a of a cash grab this is it gets a big 0/10. Good job Nintendo."
buzzardslicer,"Mar 23, 2020",10,Ignore the review bombing haters. This is the best in the series. Sad that people have nothing better to do.
AbsolutelyBri,"Mar 23, 2020",0,This game is completely awesome if you are the only one playing on a single switch. But having to share a switch and second players being degraded to a lesser status of not being able to progress the island completely ruins the two player experience on the same switch. Don’t plan on two people playing equally on the same switch.
SixtySixOwls,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Two people on one Switch? Only one of you gets to make big decisions and actually experience the whole game because you can only have one island per system! Want to play co-op, because playing individually and not getting the full experience would ****? Nope! The followers barely have any functionality.

Theley,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"What an amazing comeback. I don't mind about the fact that you can only have one island per Switch. This put aside, it's a fantastic game, relaxing and wholesome. Perfect for this ""work at home"" period."

lrn2review,"Mar 23, 2020",7,"I'm a veteran AC player, and while I like the game it definitely has its issues. A lot of this review is nitpicky, but at the end of the day if you enjoy life sims you will probably like this. It is overall a nice game.

Pros:
-Almost total control over the layout of your island eventually
-More customization options for furniture, clothing and even your character than before
-HD graphics are beautiful, the new museum in particular is stunning
-The music is great, and has a lot of callbacks to older games in the series
-Villagers do a lot more things than they have in previous entries and have better dialogue than they did in NL; Blathers will blather again if you let him
-Seasonal events now last more than one day; a relief for those of us who have jobs but don't want to time travel
-Extremely large pool of villagers
-Certain redundant facilities were cut, like Re-Tail
-New storage and inventory system is pretty great; lots of more items stack, storage automatically organizes your things
-Tool and outfit rings streamline the UI nicely
-Nook Miles give a nice sense of direction when you just want to keep playing the game after doing most of the big tasks for the day
-Crafting provides a nice alternative to waiting for items to show up at the store
-Outfits are stored in the wand, which saves inventory space
-Very relaxing atmosphere

Cons:
-Touchscreen controls exist for typing, yet are not enabled for pattern creation or inventory use
-Items that can stack have wildly varying limits, from 10 for fruit to 99 for weeds
-The tutorial is roughly a week long if you don't time travel, and you don't get to listen to hourly themes until this tutortial ends
-Autosave system is near pointless because you can still save scum, even detrimental because you can't ""save and continue"" anymore, leading to short rollbacks at times; Resetti got fired for nothing
-Seasonal events are locked behind DRM
-Lots of items and facilities considered series staples are out like gyroids and The Roost, as are some of the best additions from NL like the Dream Suite; veterans are instead left to guess whether or not these might return through updates that may or may not be free
-Villager dialogue is still relatively toned down if you're a fan of WW or PG
-No ability to move the town hall despite being able to move everything else not on the beach
-Online functionality is not particularly reliable, while local multiplayer is messy and requires you to stay in the same area instead of just using split screen functionality; also you have to watch a long cutscene every time there's a visitor
-No option to disable the smoothing filter applied to patterns
-Weapon durability in a series that generally did not have it is aggravating, and having the highest tier be breakable is actually a bit infuriating because it defeats the purpose of the best axe in particular
-Tools aren't stored in the tool ring like outfits are in the wand
-Islands are tied to console and not cart, meaning you need to pay $300 ($360 if you bought digital like a ****) instead of $60 to have your own if you were hoping to split up your household
-The ""mayor"" returns from NL in all but name, leaving players that come after them left with fewer gameplay options because they can't terraform
-Your regular inventory is not automatically organized like storage is
-Many items are locked behind crafting
-Crafting cannot be done in batches
-Making a mistake in a long set of choices in dialogue often means starting from the beginning again; there is usually no option to go back to the previous choice you messed up"
TomNook,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"This game is AWFUL if you plan to share it. 2nd player is useless, they cannot progress the island, nor help build anything. It ****. The reviewers never even tested this out, shoes how useless they truly are."
Rookie2222,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"EDIT: modifying my score from a 4 to a 0 due to more issues with only the primary player being able to do things around the island. I do not recommend this game

I don't want to review bomb a game, but I do want to voice my opinion. This game is fantastic and I even enjoy the one island with multiple people (it should be an option but that's how I intended to play it anyway) but the fact the first person has the entire control of the island is egregious. I bought it and let my roommate play it first while I finished up work and by the next day I loved the town already at which point I discover (which had not been mentioned anywhere prior to the games release) that he had all the control in perpetuity and there is nothing I can do about it. Now I'm five days in and not going to delete it but oh my god please Nintendo, let us at least switch the island representative if not let everyone spruce up the town. And while you're at it let everyone have there own island to keep that dream alive for the rest of the reviewers here.

PS. I agree with the other people that mentioned it's odd none of the official reviewers really mentioned this."
Cooltop101,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"This game is honestly so great, with everything going on in the world right now it's nice to have a peaceful escape, some users are leaving bad reviews about limitations of multiple people living on one island but fail to realize new leaf also limited non mayor's of what they can do. Besides how calming the game is, it looks great, there were a couple things in the beginning of the game, like donating a single item at a time to blathers, but if you progress it'll get better"
Hinklink,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"A 0. I bought a Nintendo Switch just for this cause all their other games are terrible. But ti turns out this one is terrible as well. It looks horrific, ultra low quality and of course 1080p. The Switch itself is a nightmare to use, max 5mbps downloads bad connections etc. Multiplayer is done horrific, takes forever to play with someone and when you do you wonder why? There is nothing to do, just a slow and boring nerd game. So sad I wasted 400euro on a console that performs worse than an iPhone and with barely any games on it.

Edit update: I sold the switch for 430eur so no loss. The game is SEVERELY limited and bottle necked by the Switch's terrible hardware. Load screens inside load screens lmfao. Got a new room in your house? Nice load screen, so sad. Hit boxes are so huge you feel like playing Minecraft. Place a lamp and you can't walk around for 1 meter lol... It's a mediocre game at best, but of course the Nintendo fanboys think it's the best thing ever."
Anynamewilldo,"Mar 23, 2020",1,****. When I found out I couldn't do as much as a second player I instantly turned it off. I have no reason to play the game now. It's ruined the whole experience

Thrazghul,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"I am not the kind of person to throw a big fit when I can't get my way. I understand some games are just not my style, and that's fine. My problem here, however, is that this *is* my kind of game, but I can't play it because I had the audacity to give it to my daughter for her birthday.

Oh, don't get me wrong, she loves it. But she gets to do anything she wants on it, doesn't she? I don't. I had the unfortunate luck to be the **** that is player 2, and for some reason unknown to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence, Nintendo decided to gate EVERYTHING behind player one's progress.

I can't even get an axe right now. And I am not going to yell at my 10-year old to hurry up. She discovering the game and loving it. I don't want to ruin it for her. If I had the chance to ruin the day/week/life of the developers that thought this was a good idea, I'd take it in a heartbeat, though.

If you want to play an amazing game, live by yourself, or have no worries of completely screwing over everyone else in your house that might want to play this game, go for it. If you have multiple people, make sure you buy multiple copies of the game. Oh, yeah. but multiple switch consoles (one for each person that wants to play) because it is one save per game per console.

Absolutely freaking infuriating, Nintendo. Five games in my house that want to play this - myself, my husband, two of my sons, and my daughter. I already bought the family online account that you force to be a year in length. I've already replaced the freaking POS joycons that are prone to stick drift, and then sent both sets in to get repaired. The console has lost sound from anything but plugging into the dock for HDMI. The left hand rail won't connect to the controller. All of that, and you still have to bend me over and penetrate me with this decision on Animal Crossing.

I would ask for lube with how much you have bent us over, but I am not sure my daughter has unlocked it yet."

gunshy99,"Mar 23, 2020",0,This game **** me and my brother wanted to play on the same island but because I am not the island founder I cant progress through the game.I cant unlock any of the shops and museums just because I am not the founder.Also you can only make one island per switch so I cant even play on my own island and get the full experience on MY **** why would Nintendo on purpose make their game worse?For money they want me to have to buy my own switch just so I can also play the full game well guess what Nintendo?I'm not going to give you more money you just lost a customer because of your greed and anti consumer bs.Also the crafting system is annoying I cant even tell when my tool is going to break what kind of horrible design is that?They also took out the measuring system so their is even less stuff to do!Yaaaay make the game have less content!This game can pound sand if you are playing by yourself I still would not recommend it just play new leaf or townsfolk those games have much more content and don't have that annoying tool system.
rafaelmsoares,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"It's ridiculous how only one person can enjoy the game per console, my partner tried to start it after me and couldn't do anything in the island... Only gather resources. It's ridiculous that Nintendo goes this far to push for multiple consoles per household"
Doc_Marion,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"As an relative starter for the series, I started playing New Leaf on the 3DS to decide whether or not I should buy this game on launch.
Oh boy, I was hooked. I absolutely love every aspect of the game, and playing it makes my day so much happier and more calm.
This is not a conventional game. It’s definitely not for everyone and people should know what they’re getting into before buying. But if you have patience, if like a tranquil, gorgeous experience and enjoy the little things in life, this game may be for you."
Nyron45,"Mar 23, 2020",0,You can only have one island and you have to share it with other profiles on your switch
Lozalien,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"I am an hour and a half into the game before i realize that I'm playing on my wife's island. Nintendo made a terrible decision to not have an option to have your own island on a separate profile. This is obviously a ploy to force your clientele to purchase another copy. Shame, I've been looking forward to this game for a while. Needless to say i will not be buying another copy and not reccomend this game to anyone who has a friend or family  who wants to play"
jamrt,"Mar 23, 2020",0,No way for me to experience the full game unless I go on someone else's account (and even then There's still stuff i'd miss out on). The shared island and representative systems single-handedly ruin the game.
Buky92,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Going to Join the down train here. I returned my copy of AC:NH due to the single island per switch issue. Oh, you want me to go buy ANOTHER console and ANOTHER copy of the game if I want my own island that I can maintain and my girlfriend wants the same? Seriously Nintendo? If this **** gets fix I may get the game again."
moby323,"Mar 23, 2020",5,"Game of the year, one of the best installments in the whole series. Anyone who has enjoyed this series will absolutely love this game. It is very deep and well paced with almost endless ways of having fun."
DanBob,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"I hate to say it but this is ridiculous: being unable to progress in the game if you're not the Resident Representative is frankly unacceptable for a game that so strongly encourages sharing and mutual enjoyment. On top of the restrictions this puts on households with only 1 copy of the game, you're also restricted to 1 island *per console*.

If you're playing alone and are the sole user of your console, go nuts! 10/10. If you're planning on sharing? Wait and see...
I will gladly change or remove my review if this issue is ever resolved."
FatalS,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"I spent months counting down to getting this game. I love playing Animal Crossing. But so does my girlfriend, and with one shared switch that means one of us is basically a glorified NPC. One person gets a game, the other gets to visit. And if players don't share the same island preferences, too bad, only Player 1 matters.

I'm sure Nintendo meant for situations like mine to get people buying another switch, but instead it's just killed the game for me."

Aie,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"Very disappointed you have to share one island with multiple people. There was no excuse for this to be the case in this day and age and as such I'm forced to give a score of 0, as this greatly impacts the gameplay. Hopefully they come to their senses and fix this issue"

adanmoran,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"The single-save system ruins the game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you are sharing a switch with others.

Only the first player to the game can make the most decisions/progress - the rest of the players are left with the remains. In the old games you could buy a new cartridge or use a different memory card, but you can't do that here - the data is saved directly onto the switch and can't be moved to an SD card. The game is only worth it if you are the sole player, otherwise you should not buy this game until the horrible save system is removed."
AsrielDreemur,"Mar 23, 2020",8,"For those who are not familiar to the animal crossing franchise, Animal Crossing is a life stimulation game where you take your time to relax and explore your island as well as forming friendship with the villagers while doing outdoor activities such as bug catching and fishing.

As for New Horizons the game is just pleasant to play. The control feels right, there's more events to do, the atmosphere is much more lively and what's more with the addition of terraforming allows players to build new path or destroying the edge of a cliff in their island to how they see fits. Veterans of the animal crossing franchise fans will most likely appreciate all these new addition to the games.

The games does everything right in term of the gameplay but it does have some cons to it as well. Nintendo have set restriction where you only can have one island on a switch which means that you can't have multiple islands on the same console. It also restricted other profile users in your switch to perform activities in the island if you're not the owner of the island. Therefore New Horizon single player aspect is fun and all but if you're looking for a co-op experience this game does really poorly on that aspect."
Nonoo,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"The user score is almost ridiculous. Sure I understood the problem, and the ""1 island blah blah"" is a bad thing I agree, but could u make a REAL review and speak about the WHOLE game too? Because it is amazing and doesn't deserve a 0 or 1 at all, that's a fact. It is beautiful, charming, cute, colorful, full of old and new features. Clearly the best Animal Crossing game in my opinion, you can do so many things and I'm having a really good time with it and with my friends. And did you go to the museum?! It is incredible, damn! I give the game a 9/10 for sure, but 10/10 is for counterbalance a lot of stupid rates ;)"
SpiderBiff,"Mar 23, 2020",0,I was super excited about this game until I discovered that you can only have one island per Switch. Player 2 can't progress until player 1 does. Lame!
timobeerke,"Mar 23, 2020",1,"To actually review this game I think you'll need two scores. The first score being the game when you are Citizen Representative (you booted up the game first) and the second score when you are an additional player.

I was unlucky enough to boot the game second and am not a Citizen Representative and to be honest I stopped playing the game after two days. You always have a feeling you have an inferior game where you are nothing more than a character on someone's island. You don't get to name the island, you don't get to build the structures on the island and you don't get to contribute to most of the ""story"" which Animal Crossing has to offer.

My brother who is the Citizen Representative enjoys the game and it is really polished and has a nice gameplay loop, but I feel ripped off. To me, this game deserves nothing more than a 1 out of 10, because I really cannot live with the fact that my game is limited. If you pay €60 for a game, you want to fully enjoy it. Now I just can't because of these restrictions."
emiplaynintendo,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"This game is relaxing, fun, and a fantastic way to escape from the awful things that are going on in the world. Fishing, crafting, selling, catching, it all just feels really rewarding."
JanisB,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"Amazing. I don't understand all these criticisms that you can only create one island per switch, if I were you I would confirm by researching the features that provide the game. This game has infinite possibilities, it's perfect. I love everything in this game"
i_mush,"Mar 23, 2020",0,"This game has been marketed as a game for family amd friends where the multiplayer was encouraged, yet if you don’t get to start the islamd, you’re basically a roamer that aimlessly collects fruit. You give no contribution to the development of the island and are bound to the progress the first player decides to male, it feels like you don’t matter at all, you don’t even receive recipes or anything.   Factor in the decision of one island per console and you can easily jump to the conclusion that nintendo wants every engaged player to own a console, and since the Nintendo switch sits on a price range that’s way higher than that of the Nintendo 3DS this is just absurd.    If you’re alone the game is fine and perfect, if you share the console with other people the game will be cool just for the first player, and utterly boring and discriminating for the remaining players. Also, if the first player stops playing, everyone is stuck and the only option is to restart the game from zero."
Blundell92,"Mar 23, 2020",9,"The one island per console is pretty stupid, but I really enjoy the game. Probably a much bigger issue for those with families or multiple users on the same Switch but for me it's not too much of a problem. Really great way to unwind, the Nook Miles are a little gimmicky but keep the game interesting for now. Kinda wish it wasn't locked to real time but mostly because I'm impatient. I can see myself logging a metric f-ton of time into this game. Good way to calm down after ripping and tearing through Hell in Doom Eternal."
Saaka,"Mar 23, 2020",6,"Gameplay itself is great if you are only user of Switch, but if you have to share the console, expiriences may vary. Forcing players to live on one island is questionable decision. This should be players choice."

walt,"Mar 23, 2020",4,Single player seems more of the same as previous game. Couch co-op don't buy. 1 island per switch coop partner has limited stuff they can do and just follows main player around. We gave up as bought for coop. Should have done more research first. Money wasted

IRhodes,"Mar 23, 2020",9,Great game and so relaxing. If you liked the previous ones in the series you'll this. Many new features and enhanced but still charming graphics. Must buy switch and switch kite game
REKT,"Mar 23, 2020",10,Really fun and chill game. Encourages playing daily but not ALL day that is a nice change of pace. Easy to lose yourself in. Better multiplayer would be nice.
buffmckagan,"Mar 22, 2020",8,"I think it's a really enjoyable, addictive game. The graphics look really good, and doing chores for Tom Nook doesn't feel like it. The criticisms about one island per console are very valid, and understandably frustrating. I can see how families and couples would have a problem with it, though, even if it is something I do not. Just don't think that's worth giving it a zero. Anyways, buy at your own risk, but do your homework first"
Mihra,"Mar 22, 2020",1,"I was super excited for this game... and then find out it’s a single shared island for everyone on the switch. My husband has pretty bad anxiety, and wouldn’t touch anything because he was afraid to mess something up. Definitely a no from me."
jtking96,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"Not only is the game limited to one island per console, but no player other than the person who started the game first is able to progress the game at all. They can't contribute resources to building, they don't unlock things naturally as the game progresses, and they have no accomplishments they can achieve.

Many people giving positive reviews argue that it's fine because ""its always been this way"" and that really isn't true. No AC game before this one has limited you to one town per console. If I could buy a second copy of the game and get the option to enjoy it as much as my wife is, then I might be okay with it. But the only option would be to spend hundreds of dollars and buy a second console, if I could even find one in stock right now."
Broski2K18,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"It’s amazing, great, good, fantastic, incredible, awesome, brilliant, splendid!"
hazsch,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"It seems all the negative reviews are about the fact that you can only have one island per system, regardless of how many users there are. If this isn't a problem then you, like me, will absolutely love this game. It's Animal Crossing - on the Switch. Things from the older games have been streamlined but it feels different enough to be a worthy sequel.

The game looks gorgeous, the character customisation is at a series high, the villagers seem more alive than ever before, the progression is satisfying (albeit slow in the first few days), and all in all, the game is just fantastic. I'll be playing it for years, for sure."
Sage_the_Husky,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"First off let me say that the ""1 Island per Switch"" argument is completely invalid. All the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now. Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.

Now enough of that.

This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.

The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda **** in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the ""1 Island per Switch"" people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way. Hope this helps!"

Pikkewyn,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"I mean, I kind of understand why most of the negative reviews are just against the one island per console thing that also happened with the rest of the entire franchise and that was clearly said in the AC Direct and in the back of the game box, cause it's still a bad thing. I get why people are punishing the limitations of multiplayer cause it was one of the main things in every trailer/announcement and in some aspects it can be really poor. But I just can't understand all the 0/10, especially the ones saying it's like a HD New Leaf.

Are we playing the same game? I've spend my last three days around my island in a 4K monitor and I think it's one of the prettiest games I've ever played. Every franchise has its style, you can't make this game with the details of Red Dead Redemption 2 because you could destroy what AC means: simple but cool relaxing folky ambients to spend your life on. New Horizons maintains the style of the saga with new and more detailed than ever graphics, amazing lightning and weather effects and the perfect acoustic soundtrack for a walk in the woods (plus a lot of new and reinvented features that combine very well with that ""deserted island in modern days"" feel of everything).

It came out a few days ago and I don't get why some people are asking for big things at the very beginning **** that's supposed to be played day by day for a very long time. In the third day around the island I had sooooo many things to do I really didn't know where to start. The way you can decorate everything step by step, and the way you feel when you finally unlock every little feature... I think it's the best AC ever made, or at least one of the great ones. And for all the missing characters and features for the fans like Brewster or the gyroids it's all coming soon with free updates.

Maybe you're new and you were looking for a different experience, maybe you really didn't know it was limited to one island (which is a very bad point but it's not something Nintendo has tried to hide with this and any other past Animal Crossing game), or idk, maybe you want a Grand Theft Animal... What I'm just trying to say is that I believe this is a pretty good game that doesn't deserve all the hate it's receiving here. Just calm down. Times are getting very weird and this is the perfect game to stress out :)"
DankHEShells,"Mar 22, 2020",0,This is probably one of the weakest entries into the series to date. New mechanics have seemingly been added at the expense of older great mechanics. I'm around 20 hours into the game and have my town setup along with several house expansions. The worst thing about this game is the complete and total lack of Gyroids. Why would Nintendo remove a major staple of the AC universe. I am seriously considering returning this game at this point because I could honestly go back and play any other AC game and have more fun than I have with new horizons.
xlenny,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"I have to rate this game a 0 like many others have said for the same reason is you cannot have more than one island per switch.  The local multiplayer is a joke.  The first person that does the tasks,  gets the rewards and everyone else don't get share that joy. If you can have 4 people on an island on local coop and 8 people with online multiplayer visit your island.  There is no reason why this game cannot be patched to give the same experience to everyone.

its the same story as others have mentioned already.

Nintendo the year is 2020 not 1985.  Multiple game saves do exist.  The Nintendo Switch do have on board memory and a SD card slot for extra storage. No worries it can handle it!

Nintendo have designed Animal crossing this way.  They did this on purpose to force people to buy hardware and a second copy of the game. shameful. Other than that is is a great game, too bad its not equal for everyone.

Here's how the game should work with a single switch : Johnny signs in with his Nintendo profile,  Plays Animal Crossing,  does his tasks and game progression.  once done Jane signs in with her profile, Plays Animal Crossing, does her tasks and game progression.

Want to play on the same island together? no problem,  Choose which Island you want to play on and  when the 2nd player visits they can take some resources with them to share. Both can continue to play together and farm resources that they can keep or trade.  Sounds simple, but Nintendo don't want it that way.

Bottom Line is :  To truly enjoy this game multiplayer you need two Nintendo Switches and two copies of the game."
Digibutter64,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"Retains the relaxed and addictive atmosphere the series is known for while also offering many quality of life improvements, such as choosing where other villagers live and the ability to place furniture outside. These factors contribute to an excellent amount of customisation and ensure that I will be playing for years to come.

I have two complaints with this new entry though. The first is the crafting mechanic. While scavenging for materials to build things ranging from tools to furniture is interesting initially, the novelty wears off quickly and it becomes a chore. This is especially evident with tools constantly breaking. The second complaint is the lack of cloud saving, giving me no current way to back up my save data."
GayleBeech,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"Played first 3 days (20,21,22 March). The island starts with TWO villagers and only Nook 3.  Can't even access the whole island.  Can't buy tools. No clothing or furniture stores.  Extremely boring

Nook miles gives alerts when you do basic tasks, but it just insists the game is fun.  The trailer is way further into gameplay.  You have to build everything yourself and you aren't even mayor anymore.  No personality of other games and this cost 60 damn dollars"

Policcio,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"Boring, repetitive. In the live-services era, Nintendo decided to launch a game UNFINISHED, just to ignore it two months after the release.

I'm almost sure i will sell it by the end of the month."

kmcdevitt,"Mar 22, 2020",5,"I bought this game as soon as it came out since I have always been a fan. I started my own island an character and fully expected my sister, who shares a switch with me, to be able to play her own game too. We find out later that she can not have her own island and that she is extremely limited to what she can do in the game. The whole point to animal crossing is doing stuff in the community. What is she going to do? Just walk around in a world she cant even dig in? Great job Nintendo. You made what could have been a perfect game into a dud."
Babiel,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"First things first: sing the petition to don't restrict the number of islands per console:  ****/Bz2kfWTc4y.

Apparently, Nintendo is still in 1997. One island per console is one of the most disgusting things I have seen in the game industries. It completely ruins the experience for people who share a switch, not to mention no cloud saves, and no way to transfer data to other system. And it doesn't make sense in absolutely any point of view. If you share a switch, DON'T BUY THIS GAME unless you are okay with sharing resource, no tutorials for the second one to play, and a billion things more"
LifeHistory,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"Just like others have mentioned on how Trashtendo wants you to buy more than one system. Its sick how greedy and how they've became as a company they are the worst. And people keeps supporting and buying their expensive garbage? WHATS WRONG WITH YOU?

I remember when I never understood how they could get away with selling Handheld systems without a charger and I still cant understand how that was possible and people were OK with it. Also their discounts are the worse their games are so expensive. They sell you a 6years old game for 50-60$ in the Shop. They think their games are something from heaven. PLEASE Trashtendo go to hell."
Gralle,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"One save per console and local coop is somehow worse than playing alone. The second player cannot even access his/her inventory and if p2 is fishing and p1 opens its inventory the fish will disappear. A shared camera view with the zoomed in camera demands that you stick together, but there is rarely anything for two players to do on the same screen. P2 just tags along and watches, while also causing an annoyance for p1 because the camera view is shared. I bought this game to play with my gf and I wish I could return it now."
Shippuden64,"Mar 22, 2020",9,I am loving the game so far. The only setback is the limitation to just one island per switch and that the local multiplayer player could be much better.
Jjdm11,"Mar 22, 2020",8,"Animal crossing new horizons is a brilliant return after the disappointment that was amiibo festival.This game has you start on a desert island where you live your life.Nook miles are a new addition that makes and breaks the game at the same time,the game has things to work towards something previous entries lacked this is fun however it can get grindy and greatly limit freedom with things locked behind nook walls that ought to be unlocked.This game has it’s polishing issues and bafflingly poor implementation of some ideas life travelling to new **** loading times are some of the worst in a video game 1-2 minutes the standard this is to load some of the best visuals in a switch game it looks like ps5 or even pc how this runs on a switch I’m unsure .This game has the foundation of an excellent game but falls short due to a lack of polish despite this ,this is still the best one in the series topping new leaf."
CygnusiaX1,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"I find it funny that there are those here complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per Switch. First of all, help the first person choose your island layout. Secondly, two heads are better than one in getting the first stumbling blocks out of the way so you can do whatever you want. My wife and I have our own Switches, and only one copy of the game. Mine is a day-one purchase Switch and hers is the new AC:NH themed version. We swap our single copy back and forth between our two consoles. Once we get a second copy, then we can do standard multiplayer. Right now, with the insanity going on outside our doors, this is SUCH a breath of fresh air. It's relaxing and sublime, and takes our minds of what's going on right now. And it has so much eye candy, it's ridiculous. I only drop it one point because we can't figure out how to trade fruit between our islands, what with us only having one copy of the game."
FU_AC,"Mar 22, 2020",0,i'm sure ACNH is amazing for player 1 but player 2 is gimped to all hell and has barely any say in what goes on. there is no way to play 2 islands on one switch and i refuse to buy a second switch to play it.
lambdafish,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"As a ""player 2"", Nintendo has essentially told me that I can't ever play properly on the game that I share. In theory, sharing an island works, and many games have succeeded in this. The resources most definitely should be independent per player so that everyone has stuff they can do, the fact that it doesn't literally makes the game unplayable in large households and families that share a switch because one player will perform all of the activities, filling their NookMiles, leaving nothing left for anyone else to do. Sharing an island at all should be a choice, and the game itself should be designed around sharing, with safeguards allowing every player to fully enjoy the game. At present this is far from the case and it leaves an extremely poor play experience for ""player 2's"" and even Players 1's to a certain extent. Unless this is changed, the game is worthless to me and many others, therefore I can't give any score other than 0.

And to anyone saying that people giving negative reviews over a single, ""minor"" feature/complaint, and are trying to counterbalance the score to ""drown out the whiners"", remember that the people reviewing these low scores literally cannot experience the game that you are giving 10's for because of this problem."
Drawnimo,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"Almost every negative review I have seen for this game addresses the ""shared island problem."" And it is causing the user score to plummet. However, in the midst of all the controversy, people seem to forget that this problem doesn't even affect everyone, and that there is a stellar game past this one issue. I would have rated this game 9/10 for its slow start and lack of camera freedom, but I'm rating it a 10/10 to counterbalance all the reviews that forget to actually review the game and its merit rather than a single one of its flaws. I do not believe that a game so fun, heart-warming, charming, and immersive should receive such a low user rating solely because it doesn't specifically tailor to your needs. I can acknowledge the problem, and sure it really ****, but it isn't representative of literally everything else about this game. In my mind, this game is a near masterpiece and I cannot wait to continue playing it. If you have multiple people that want to play on the same console, I acknowledge that your experience will be hindered due to Nintendo's admittedly greedy policies. However, Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a game, as a social experience, and as a Switch title, deserves much more than what the user score would initially lead you to believe.
My final score: 9/10"
NorwaySpruce,"Mar 22, 2020",5,This is a game for people who love doing chores. In addition to crafting your own tools that break after 20 uses you also have to craft all the stores and the other villagers houses as well.
HunterXJacob,"Mar 22, 2020",7,Very disappointed with how they are limiting multiplayer. My wife and I are managing to share but this is not going to be good in a household with children. Changing my rating as the game is wonderful. But it is so hard not to be upset with how they could employ a few things to fix this.
Anonacon,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"Me and my girlfriend bought this. Turns out you can only have one island per CONSOLE, not even per user. The second user basically can’t do anything... can’t trade, can’t place buildings, can’t even get recipes unless they have been unlocked by the first person who played the game. Literally the only work around for this is to buy another Switch. It makes loot boxes look moral. So I have to give it zero because guess what, until my girlfriend is bored of it... I can’t even play it. Thanks, Nintendo."
sunnyh,"Mar 22, 2020",4,"I'm cool with the one island per console limitation, but its insane that progress in the game is restricted to what player one does. I recently started an island with my wife. What if my wife quits playing the game? Will I have to start over? Crazy."
Giboultou,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"First of all I want to admit that yeah, it’s true single console multiplayer options are terrible. The second character gets dumbed down to a sort of follower that can only be in the shadow of the main player. Truth is tho that this feature has been true of New Leaf as well. If you wanted multiple villagers, the second wasn’t mayor and didn’t have as much freedom. So I would say that this isn’t a step back, but rather a lack of step forward from the developers on that front. However I don’t believe that this condemns all the amazing other features and steps forward. All furniture has been remodelled with great details, textures and lighting effects for a game with such a simplistic artistic direction. The museum is sublime, and the hourly music is memorable (for some). Animals now do lots of activities too and feel more alive than ever with witty and varied dialogue. Crafting is simple but well implemented, and it is a pleasure to slowly build the island into the little village the previous games had gotten us used to. I am ready to take off two points for the limitations created for families/friends with one console, though it does not concern me personally, but that does not entirely condemn it for all the wonderful things it has to offer and the great effort that was put into designing the game. It can’t be enjoyed by all, but for those that are planning to play solo, go for it, there is so much to get out of this experience!!"
NomNomAutomat,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"It totally **** that you can only have one island per switch. My boyfriend tried to make an island of his **** NO. So now he get to sit beside and just watch me play.
Do it again and do it right Nintendo."
undertal,"Mar 22, 2020",4,"1. Crafting is extremely poor - really basic combinations without meaningful depth.
2. Interactions aren't good either - chop wood, gather some fruits, go fishing - its no better than simple game from Appstore
3. BE AWARE, BECAUSE IT'S A NIGHTMARE! - Annoying animations. Did you catch the same butterfly for the 20-th time? It doesn't mather - you are forced to watch same freaking animation ""yes, I catched it, wow!"". Would you like to sell something? It's good but everytime you are forced to read the same text all over again. It's going to be like 1000 times throughout whole game.
You can play it, but be aware that whole bunch of your time would be consumed by meaningless conversation, and animations you cant skip. Without any award"
TeddyBear0-0,"Mar 22, 2020",10,can't stop playing this is what I've been waiting for btw if you don't like animal crossing then don't buy it because its more of the same so yeah if not its amazing
Skyrapture,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"Super jeu. Seulement trois jours dessus mais je m'éclate, il y a toujours des choses a faire et le système d'objectifs permet de renouveller l'intérêt après la routine quotidienne effectuée.

Ceux qui ont noté 0 par rapport au multijoueur sont des trolls.
Nous jouons à trois sur l'île et souvent en simultané net nous avons aucun problème avec les ressources.
Achetez le jeu et jouez y avant de critiquer."
Hotbeanjuice,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"As everyone else has said, it just ridiculous to only allow one island account per console, clearly a money move. Didn’t think Nintendo would stoop to being so disrespectful to their fan base and a beloved game."
Feels64,"Mar 22, 2020",9,EDITED: After 3 days it's gotten a lot better. Everyday there is more stuff to do. Boosting my rating from 7 to a 9. Love this game and am going to play it every day.
Stubbzy48,"Mar 22, 2020",0,Unable to create more than 1 island per switch and no option to even move game data to be able to get around this. A complete cash grab to force you to buy another switch and game to be able to enjoy the game to its fullest if multiple people want to play.
JonnyDepp,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"A bad joke, just one island per Switch really playable. If you are a family with one switch, you will be pissed
Off. Nintendo, shame on you. Once again you give a **** on happy customers."
Fumiko,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"One island per console is unacceptable. If you share your Switch with anyone else, don't buy this."

ChaseU,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"Amazing game, gameplay, vibes, ALL OF IT. Don't listen to the whiners leaving 0 star reviews. Well worth the buy - the best AC game yet!"
Eine,"Mar 22, 2020",2,There are no events in the game. Even the holydays. The world feels empty and grey. All provious parts of AC series definetly better
Relativokay,"Mar 22, 2020",10,Definitely the most expansive and fun Animal Crossing entry! All my expectations were surpassed.
Ifrit004,"Mar 22, 2020",3,"While the first player in the house will have a great time on this, all subsequent players will have a muted, limited experience.
I wasn't aware of the one island per console feature and this really does ruin the game for everyone else. I would not have bought this had I know, hopefully Nintendo will do the right thing and patch this out."
ErnestGamingEC,"Mar 22, 2020",9,This game is really beautiful and **** people at Nintendo really put effort into this and it is worth the delay that it gets. Every time you build something it felt like an accomplishment but things like getting material from rocks tree and other needs to take a day to replenish which is disappointing and waiting for a building to be build makes me really impatient all the time.This game could been benefitted from less waiting time it felt like eternity to wait for things to be done
khu,"Mar 22, 2020",4,"-no cooking
-almost no interactions with furniture (ex: you can't play the guitar or watch tv, they are just there)
-1 island per switch
-incredibly bad co-op
-item durability

Everything is there to prolong your game time and sell more Swtiches. No depth or mechanics, only shallow visuals.

If you're not after collecting animals for your island like Pokemon, you'd be better off playing **** Valley. If this was not a Nintendo title critics would rate it 6/10."
DrLightning,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"New horizons is charming, has great music, and brings new ideas to the series without messing with the animal crossing identity."
BrushedRed,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Such a great series! I've been playing since the first one on Gamecube. Taking what we already love about the series and building on it, this game will be just as good as we all hoped for, no doubt about it. The crafting aspect is very welcome and being able to shape and remodel your island to your will is such a step forward for the series. I've only put around 5 hours on this so far, but I'm already in love!

After spending 5-10 more hours on it today, I can say this is easily the best animal crossing to exist! They really covered everything, and everything is turned up to eleven. Each and every aspect that could have gotten better has gotten better, just look at the museum for instance! It is incredible!"
RyanElliott,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"This game is pretty good,  it's good to see animal crossing back at it's feet (after that one garbage game on the wii u) the games charming, funny sometimes. and just everything animal crossing."
Earthquakemass,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Pretty fun game. Relaxing, adorable, and simple. I dont see why people are coming in a review bombing it with 0's metacritic should do somthing about this because its really becoming a problem."
Neeeenah,"Mar 21, 2020",4,"This game feels like it's trying to force homes to buy multiple Switches rather than letting separate accounts use one Switch to experience separate game play. No other game is set up like this. It also restricts content so rather than letting a person binge play, it encourages you to frequently check in on a regular basis."
Operation-Z,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"So far of what I played, I don’t think it deserves all the hate it gets, however some of the problems especially early on can be a huge dealbreaker to some such as 1 island per user, co-op, and the fact that it starts off super slowly, which could turn off new fans. Also why do you get hourly music later in the game? Hearing the same track for the whole day gets really irritating. Also I don’t really like the piece of music, but that is a me problem. Hopefully Nintendo listens and fixes some of these issues. Overall, I highly recommend this game. Gorgeous graphics, fun and addicting gameplay, and the amazing charm the series is best known for."
MintyEthan,"Mar 21, 2020",5,Why one island per switch? That’s so stupid and that doesn’t work for families who share a switch. That’s awful
AB6785,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"I honestly think that this is one of the best games I’ve ever played. There is so much attention to detail with this. I hope that they continue to update everything as time goes on to add even more content.

My only issues with the game so far are:
- It’s slow to start so do everything you can and then skip your clock forward until you have the full museum and the store.
- The cut scenes when people join and leave your island are annoying after a while and are far too long.
- The island tours need to provide more of a benefit because if you have enough friends, you likely will have all of the fruit anyway."
Scutch1980,"Mar 21, 2020",3,This game could really benefit from respecting the players time a little more.  It's a decent enough time to gather resources and craft things.  But the worse offender is no way to retrieve your save file to a different Switch?  I mean what do I have to do if I buy a new switch and have to sell the one I have now? No one at Nintendo knowss how to respect people's time?
NatJacks,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Absolutely loving the game so far, I love how it's equal amounts of hand-holding and letting you do whatever you want. Can't wait to play this for many years like the previous games. But Nintendo really needs to add more than one island per switch..."
dlwatso15,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"I want to preface this by saying I do enjoy this game when playing single player. The only problem is I play with my wife and anyone who wants to play this game with one or more people will have a horrible time. Couch co op in New Horizons might be the worst co op I have every played in any video game. Anyone who is not player 1 is unable to access their inventory, interact with villagers or even go into buildings. How can a game have local multiplayer without split screen in 2020? It’s pathetic and it shows how low Nintendo will go to sell more consoles. If it wasn’t for this the game would be rated much higher but this is a definite deal breaker. You dun goofed, Nintendo."
SpiffyStan,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"Started the game, played for an hour or so and then came back the next day only to have to start the entire game again, I'll be trading this one in."
Kloz,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"Only 1 island per switch... come on... if someone else in your home wants to play this game they are restricted to the island of the first account to play, so that destroy the experience to the second player."
bat201,"Mar 21, 2020",3,"i'll update my review as I play. but mannnn this game is boring.
2 hours into the game and I got a house... that's all I feel like I accomplished. Games are supposed to bring some short of enjoyment, whether it be story, graphics or gameplay... This has none of that so far.... Just kill me now please......."
McKrakalaka,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"Devastating. I bought this for my boys, and our family of 5 was excited to play! Guess what? 1 island per Switch. BROKEN. I went to give artifacts to the owl and I couldnt hear the delightful descriptions because one of my boys had already completed all the requests for unique objects. Nintendo needs to fix this. Requiring 1 switch per player is BROKEN. I don't think I have ever been this angry with a company before. I am willing to buy 5 copies of Animal Crossing, but not 5 Switches. What a horrible launch experience for a game that we have been dreaming about for years."
melkorsmaia,"Mar 21, 2020",2,"Don't get if you plan on using the switch as it was intended, aka a portable console you can use while you travel, because surprise surprise nintendo is so overbearing that holidays will be released as updates that you need internet to install AND to play. Good job nintendo, you really got those evil time travelers that were SERIOUSLY cutting into your bank- oh wait, time traveling affects no one but the player who might otherwise not be able to play due to travel/work/school.
Game feels unfinished, hundreds of items cut, many characters cut (so no point to the amiibo features to get your fave villagers unless you're lucky), swimming/gyroids/paintings/99% of special npcs cut, everywhere you look theres cut content that we get to hopefully wait for nintendo to drip feed us while a chorus of people repeat that ""HEY. This next update in a week/a month/a year MIGHT be the one that gives us a few more basic features. MAYBE you should just stop complaining since now theres SO many new things **** wait, the furniture placement stuff is from hhd, and crafting furniture from harvested material to place outside is from pocket camp so. nothing new except this stick i can use to cross rivers i guess.""
-2 points for unfinished game at launch, -2 cut content over all, & -3 for nintendos controlling attitude & fans acting like just because they personally didn't LOVE a feature/got lucky the things they liked are in game means the cuts dont matter. 3 remaining are for graphics, which are a vast improvement from other installments."
heyGuysItsPete,"Mar 21, 2020",4,"It's a solid 7/10 cute little game for killing time on a chill island, but only one person per console gets to fully experience the game.  It's designed to push you to buy a second switch."

Ofdas23,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"It’s great! Nothing else to say more to describe the game. You always have something to do. You always can relax at the beach listening to the game‘s beautiful OST. Great, it indeed is a must play!"
Derkleton,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"You're only allowed one island on each console and even you're ok with that only the person who plays and creates the island first can enjoy the full experience. Other players that have accounts on the same console are extremely limited to what they can do.

Nintendo has said before that they wanted everyone in a household to have their own switch and it looks like this is one of the many ways they plan on doing it. All under the guise of ""to prevent cheating"" even though the main way people cheat is changing the internal clock on their system and they're already doing it."
Gokuro,"Mar 21, 2020",0,music is kinda boring compared to new leaf. souless game. this **** is so boring
Janimalz,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"Game is awesome, but Nintendo thinks it can convince households to each buy their own switch by hampering local play. Super annoying."
Purplezzzz,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"i really hope that one day they will translate the game into portuguese, they will make commercials in portuguese direct subtitled in portuguese but the game is never in portuguese, after the representative from latin america said that it is not a prority to translate console games, just translate those of mobile games, in short their priority and only the money, you know they do dubbed commercials but it doesn’t translate the game for us, we are the biggest country in Latin America, I think they should listen to the fans more"
Supernatastic,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"Very upset about this game. Loading times too long, I don't like waiting 10 seconds everytime I leave a tent. I hate the noises the characters make when they speak. But the worst part of all. MY SHARED CONSOLE MEANS ONLY 1 PERSON CAN PLAY THIS GAME. I share a switch with my boyfriend and because of the ""one island per console"" bull crap we basically can't both play it without one person having severely lacking boring and depressing game play. So I've let him have it. I'm very upset that a 60 dollar game only allows one save and not allowing separate games for separate profiles. Will NEVER buy another animal crossing. This was my first animal crossing ever and I'm glad I never bought any of the previous. They don't deserve my money."
gabrielthorn,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"This is a personal experience. Relaxing game, although the pace is a little too slow sometimes."
Munchie03,"Mar 21, 2020",10,By far one of the most charming games of 2020. The game offers a variety of tasks and adventure to explore with its new deserted island theme. The DIY crafting mechanic allows you to build new items instead of buying them like in past game and offers new uses for existing material on your island. The characters are charming and have unique personalities that keep the game refreshing.
shishibosslv100,"Mar 21, 2020",10,esta buenardo ya que es super adictico y divertido amigo las mejores rimas en mi reviews
Reallynintendo3,"Mar 21, 2020",0,Leaving it at 0 until nintendo fixes their 60 dollar game. This game is no fun if your a second profile onto the game. The 1st to log on has more privileges and fun than anyone else in the game
bkbckaebkcj,"Mar 21, 2020",10,All what was good in Animal Crossing is right now even more thrilling and fantastic. a 10/10 easy
Gamer4Life137,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"Only allowing one island per console is terrible and Nintendo should be ashamed of the state this game is in. Storytime: two days before launch, I read about this one island policy and was terrified. I don't have a lot of money, so my girlfriend and I share a switch and don't buy many games. She doesn't play much, so I was thrilled when Animal Crossing was announced because it looks like her type of game. Fast forward to me learning about the island, and I expressed my concerns to her. She said to me that it would be okay and we would just share. To my dismay, sharing is not an option. Only the primary player can progress the game. Any big progression moments must be done only by the one player. Any additional players just have to exist and not partake in progression. That is evil. This is the worst thing I've seen from Nintendo. I played for two hours and decided to stop and let my girlfriend play. Again, I couldn't believe how terribly the second player is treated. No new resources spawn for each player. I only played for two hours and it was enough for it to be impossible for her to progress in any capacity. She has now decided she will never play again because she tried to play but wasn't able to since she hit a complete brick wall after ten minutes. We tried to figure it out on the second day, and ultimately this game is not compatible with multiple players. If you are the only person on the switch, this game is great. If you have anyone else at all who playsthe console, the game does not work. I'm giving this a 0/10 because of how disappointed and sad my girlfriend is. Games should not bring this much upset to anyone. Games are to enjoy, not to make you miserable. Nintendo is evil. This game is terrible. I hope they patch it out but I know they won't. Nintendo is just as evil as EA."
teafan011,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Incredible game. It's definitely a must buy for anyone who enjoys creativity, relaxation, and just carefree fun. It's definitely slow and low-stakes, so if you lack patience and an imagination, go play some looter shooter or something. If you put time and work into this game, it will pay off, and the feeling of accomplishment you have when you end up with a beautiful island is amazing. 10/10"
Master__,"Mar 21, 2020",9,the critics on animal crossing new horizons are I find that people are just not happy because there is only one island for me it is not a problem I but 9 because it just a little bug on my part but otherwise the game is awesome!
Jemsutton,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"I honestly think this game was incredibly well made and was excited to delve further into it. Unfortunately, I live in a household with multiple people and only one Switch and the game only allows 1 island per Switch console. Furthermore the game is designed to give the person who initially creates the island far more agency than players who join afterwards (naming the town, doing initial town building quests). Additionally the game does not account for multiple people being on the island and always generates the same amount of resources per day, meaning anyone that plays after someone else is liable to not find any wood, stone or fruit until the next literal day of the week. All of this combines to make the local multiplayer experience terrible. All other games on the switch allow for different user profiles to create new save files, why is this not the case for Animal Crossing? On Gamecube I was able to buy another memory card to create another town, for New Horizons I would have to buy a completely new Switch and copy of the game to have another island. Do not buy this game if you have brothers, sisters, parents, friends, lovers, dogs or grandparents interested in playing it, unless of course you're somehow not affected by the global pandemic and can drop another 500 dollars so you can both play happily."
Nico85,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"This is a great entry for the Animal Crossing Franchise. The single player experience is just fantastic. I can’t wait to see what other players will do with their islands. I’m loving it, it’s fun, quirky and most of all very relaxing. To answer all the criticism coming from those who gave the game ZERO as a score: true, the one island per console is a very weird choice but it was said soooo many times and it’s written on the box as well. Read a review, a faq, watch a video on YouTube before you buy! You have no one else to blame but yourself if you bought something without gathering the (readily available) and necessary information."
Chimba84,"Mar 21, 2020",10,Great game. Slowly teaches you what to do and makes it more fun then a chore.
outrageousjoe,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"The game is probably fine but you can't fully experience it if you are the second player on the same console. You are forced to live on the island of the player who first started the game. Even worse, you share resources. So player one collects all fruits, insects etc. and you stand there with nothing. This has to be the worst game design decision ever made. Until that is fixed I cannot play and therefore not recommend the game. Shame on you Nintendo. Thats not family friendly at all."
MallRat15,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Never played an Animal Crossing game before this one, and I wish I Had. Being as I am the only one in my house to use the Switch I can say this game is fantastic. So much to do, everything completely customizable and a huge island to work with. For me it is very hard to put this game down. I can see the bad reviews by many people as the one Island per switch is very dumb, but being as its only me I am rating the game for what it is and that is a Masterpiece."
giacomoch,"Mar 21, 2020",8,"It’s a great game, short of giving it a 10 because the save file stuff is crap."
YoSahop,"Mar 21, 2020",10,This game is extremely addicting and time consuming. Especially during COVID lockdown. Very advanced and chill. Highly recommend.
Dovahnoob,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"It's decent but it gets to a point were you've done everything you can really do that day apart from just grinding bells and miles and have to wait till tomorrow to do more stuff. The neighbours don't seem to do anything and it's annoying. In New Leaf I remember them doing activities with you frequently but in the 2 full days I've played this game so far, nothing.

I love Animal Crossing but this is a let down. Customising your character and island with more freedom is awesome but that's all there really is. Nothing fun to do."
CowboyBeepboop,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"I will surely sink lots of time in this game. Do not see any problem with the restriction (one console - one island), just buy your wife/kid a Switch."
hime,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"Я не знаю как, но эта игра меня не отпускает совсем."
EFYevan,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"YES, the game starts slowly, but by day 3, I have had so much to do, I don't know what to do with all my time!  This is exactly the game the world needs right now.  Highly recommended, 10/10."
Zantillex,"Mar 21, 2020",2,"Uninspired, unoriginal and any other poor adjective you can think of. The game has developed a disgusting cult following that will avidly defend the game even if it came out with trees reminiscent of trees running on the N64 (which would probably look better than this game).  Unlike Pokemon Sword and Shield, this game doesn't have the same pull that drags you away from your every day life."
JonesCanada,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"Early play review: the first 8 hours are great.  We have 2 players on our system and in my opinion as long as you have the primary player set up the island it works great.  My wife has about 8 hours in the game, I have about 6.

Sharing an Island thoughts:
So far we both find it excellent and have had no issues with sharing an Island.  I should qualify the review by stating that I played the GameCube version extensively and put some 80 hours into the 3DS version so I haven't played all iterations of the game.  Still, I have no issues with two people sharing an island as long as the primary player initiates it so player 2, 3 and 4 aren't held back.
I always enjoyed the shared experiences of animal crossing.  How one player would teach the computer characters specific words.  You and your siblings arguing over who ran over all the flowers.  Competing to get rare fossils first.  To me that was the fun of the game.  Personally, I think so long as you aren't a control freak this is more fun forcing multiple players into a shared space.

Actual Game Review:
I love it.  To anyone who has played the game before this is a natural progression.  If you feel you are ready for a new instalment it appears to have everything you would want.  If you haven't played before you need to be prepared for what the actual game is.  Professional reviews would describe it more articulately but it is a basic communication game.  This may sound like one of those mobile games where you have to play every few hours to harvest stuff and trade things but the design predates that genre by several years.  Animal Crossing is a game where you basically hang out on an island with NPC's who you chat with and just hang out.  They are like virtual friends.  They learn your speech and are happy to see you.  You gradually develop the island by changing the landscape and adding little customizations all around.  These are all small almost mindless tasks but it gives you a felling of touching up your home.  You can also visit friends islands which is much easier in the modern age of the internet than it use to be.  It is all fun in a passive sort of way.  The game is ideally played for around 15 to 30 min a day every day for years.  You do a few tasks and watch how the world changes with the seasons and holidays.  Slowly collecting things and changing the world.  I imagine some of the negative reviews are people trying to marathon the game because they are stuck inside due to the virus outbreak.  You can play for hours a day but that probably isn't the best way to enjoy things as the game clock is part of what drives progress.  If these things sound pleasant and fun you might like it.  Animal Crossing really is an acquired taste but I am happy to say that the format still has life left in it after all these years."
JackAnvil,"Mar 21, 2020",5,"The game is fun to play, but once again Nintendo fumbles online which is why my review is a 5."
BadrGaieb,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"This is 100% the best AC experience so far Ignore the 0s given by stupid people out here, the game is amazing"
KC1994,"Mar 21, 2020",4,"It’s a fun game, very reminiscent of the old Animal Crossing games. HOWEVER, the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn’t cool. In fact, only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from Tom Nook and other characters. Not even a second copy of the game will rectify this. The only way to rectify it is to buy another switch. Nintendo is being VERY GREEDY in limiting the game play like this. And for that reason, I give this game a 4."
matthewia94,"Mar 21, 2020",3,If you're planning to play with more than one person the second player is really more of an afterthought. They get their own house and items but they can't progress the story and actually miss out on some of the interactions. The game seems really fun but it is incredibly greedy to not allow both players to have a full experience without owning additional switches.
SkrubzLeaderYT,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Amazing game, perfectly crafted for an extremely enjoyable and relaxing single player experience. It's been 7 years since a mainline Animal Crossing, and this perfectly revives the series from its grave of spin offs. If people are complaining about a single island per console, or a stripped down version of other family members villagers, the game has normally had a lesser experience for new villagers, because they did not FOUND THE ISLAND. About the single island, it was announced long before and is disappointing, but doesn't break and ruin the game.

The graphics are lovely, and every little detail is crafted for a long running fan of the series, like a love letter to us. By far the best Animal Crossing of all time."
keecommander,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Mucho mejor que new Leaf, es Genial como te mantienen ocupado con los tickets, en verdad hay gente que se queja por que debe pasar dias reales para hacer cosas, ¿Acaso solo compraron el juego por el mame?"
jahan,"Mar 21, 2020",3,The one island per switch is way of an issue than I'd thought it would be. Others not being able to progress since I haven't played it enough makes it less fun for both them and me.
ThisGameSucks_1,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"For those saying we don't understand animal crossing was always 1 island, THAT IS NOT THE POINT. I fully support the idea of having 1 island, the point is that player 2 is extremely limited (I can't even get an axe as player 2), and cannot progress without player 1 finishing everything. Player 2 can't craft certain items, can't build, can't make decisions, need I say more? All I'm doing as player 2 is paying off my debt to tom nook. Don't know if Nintendo did this on purpose to buy another console, or if they actually dropped the ball on this one.

Only buy this game if you play alone, or plan on buying multiple consoles and games."
SimoneLink,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"Il gioco è fantastico, ma se condividete la consolle con qualcun'altro diventa terribile! Solo il primo giocatore potrà godersi il gioco, tutti gli altri saranno costretti a dipendere da lui: non si può costruire, gli strumenti non si possono sbloccare e tante altre limitazioni assurde! Non si capisce perché Nintendo non abbia volute dare la possibilità di creare diverse isole su una consolle. E attenzione, è inutile comprare più di un gioco, il salvataggio sarà sempre lo stesso. Quindi se volete godervi una buona esperienza dovete comprare tante consolle!"
REDSAUCE,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"This game is amazing.
I'm a fan of animal crossing serise.
When I heard new animal crossing in switch, I'm worried because previous game is very good.
However, This game is really good.
must play."
SibSkullcracker,"Mar 21, 2020",4,"Unfortunately I have to rate this game twice lower. For a single player this is game is nice but it’s totally not recommended for a household with one console. You can only have ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH and only the first user to start the game - the founder - gets full experience. The rest can get no quests, no proper interactions with NPCs and are limited in many other ways, such as the progress of the founder. You also have to share all the resources. I don’t see anything relaxing or social in this, only disappointment.
I hope Nintendo will fix this and do it ASAP. It’s totally inappropriate and inhuman to make people buy an extra console and I think no one in the right mind is going to do so."
ONEIsland,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"It's been said 100 times **** one Island per switch is straight trash. The gamecube version did better than this. How can you take such a big step back cheating the core of your fanbase- young families who grew up with this game & now have partners, kids?! I don't understand this, even looking at the business side. No one is going to buy this, if they have anyone else in house that wants to play. CO-OP is garbage as well."
dagallas,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"I love the animal crossing series, and ACNH is a perfect addition! Countless islands to explore and everything looks great, lots to do and it is so relaxing just chilling on your personal island. Definitely pick this one up if you enjoy relaxation and fun."
GIVEMETWOMAPS,"Mar 21, 2020",0,This is the evolution of Ninendo making you buy two copies of pokemon. If this doesn't get fixed I'm ready for a class action lawsuit
Kazem,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"The game is almost perfect! I must say that the only flaw is really the fact that you can only have one island, (many review bomb confirm that) but other thant that, the game is perfect! Can't wait to put 100 more hours in it!"
Hawakn,"Mar 21, 2020",6,"El juego está bien, pero lo que me molestó bastante es que solo sea una isla por persona. Esto limita mucho la cantidad de cosas que podes hacer antes de que se renueve el ciclo."
Ayylice,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Game getting review bombed over nitpicks and small inconveniences, sounds about metacritic."
Taylo226,"Mar 21, 2020",8,"This game is just further proof that Nintendo refuses to understand what people want from an online experience. Only one island, combined with whoever leads gets all the items picked up. Bottom line is if your not leading your not progressing."
Mikyto,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing is an absolutely perfect game in all areas. I beg you, dear reader, ignore the entitled nature of the negative reviews. The decision to limit players to a single island has been made for artistic purposes and was very well communicated to the playerbase before they could have made their purchase. At the end of the day the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite consoles are portable devices that most of the time support only one player. Expecting anything else is straight entitlement.

In the graphical department Animal Crossing: New Horizons is astonishingly amazing. It's gorgeous to look at. The gameplay is fantastic and a lot of fun. This is exactly the game needed to let go and relax during these hard times."
ReviewMike,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is an amazing game by all accounts. The graphical presentation is superb, so the gameplay. Now it is absolutely impossible to rate an Animal Crossing game based on only 2-3 days of play."
XingJiNiuZai,"Mar 21, 2020",1,"Perfect for one player. Coop ****, but what KILLS the game is that you can essentially only have one player PER SWITCH. Your SO/sibling/kid will have to play on YOUR island on YOUR profile.

I cannot think of a single other home console game with this limitation. Not being able to share this with my family makes it a return."
Ellinov,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Having a total blast so far! All the animals are adorable and the music is soft and calming. My friend visited my town and we played instruments together for like 10 minutes. This was definately the kind of ""sit back and relax"" kind of game it was hyped up to be."
Elboo,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"great game great fun, its colourful and chill i like it a lot, perfect for 31 years old guy (me)"
Goodnightmoon,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"What's wrong with people here? All this outrage for the 1 Switch = 1 Island is nonsense, first of all Nintendo was very clear about this so people acting surprised about it have only themself to blame, but also every single Animal Crossing before was like this, so how is possible the best one of the series is the one getting bombed? Ridiculous. If you are the secondary player you still get like 90% of the experience and you are supposed to talk with your family and organize yourselves to make the important choices and share the resources, how is this so hard? And how is people judging the gameplay experience so negatively after just 1-2 days of gameplay? This game is not designed to be fully enjoyed on a couple of days. Grow up, the game is fantastic so far."
HardpointShadow,"Mar 21, 2020",10,Wonderful game to just sit down and relax with. Beautiful visuals and a great aoundtrack.
Taiyuabi,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"It's beautiful, is definitely more than I was expecting.
I can't wait for the upcoming events!"
dangerswlf,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"dont listen to any of the 0/10's those guys have no idea how scoring games works, I havent played the game but im just here to help the other people who wanna see if the game is good or not, the game is DEFINITELY a great game that is a must buy, it is fantastic, but you can only have one island per console, but keep in mind it was like this for new leaf as well and me and my sister were able to enjoy this game completely fine on one 3ds console, the way this game works is no different, people are only mad that the other people that wanna play would have a downgraded experience since they cant change much in the village, while I do agree that they should've fixed this since the switch unlike the 3ds, is capable of having multiple accounts, while on the 3ds there are no accounts, it is only one game and one save file and when you start playing you choose your villager, it was a missed opportunity, I wish they wouldve made it so on the switch, each account has its own village and if people want to share a village they make their own villager in that account and if they want their own village they go in another account, but its definitely something ive experienced before, but back then a 3ds was pretty much the same price as a switch lite now, so if you want them to have their own console and their own village just get them a switch lite, people probably did that with the 3ds so why not with the switch? when I played on the 3ds I was the mayor and my sister was a villager and she enjoyed the game almost as much as I did. so the people with 0/10 are outright dumb cause one flaw in a game shouldnt change it from a 10/10 to a 0/10 that just makes no sense, besides, if youre forever alone or if youre the only one in your house that wants to play the game, it would most likely be a 10/10 for you, so if you like animal crossing games or **** valley, this is a must buy."
konus43,"Mar 21, 2020",10,The best animal crossing game so far. I love the beautiful graphics and everything
adrianojimenes,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons é sem dúvida o maior jogo que chegará ao Nintendo Switch este ano, chega como o mais novo lançamento de uma série amada.  Realmente vale todo o hype! Vamos mergulhar e descobrir mais o que tem a oferecer!"
lankgod,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"This game is so goddamn good. The additions flesh out stuff that has existed since the first Animal Crossing but has felt underutilized in the past. The Nook Miles incentives give it a kind of mobile game feel, but without predatory monetization in place (yet?). The progression is very natural so far and I have total faith after just a couple days of gameplay that this game will be generous, chill as hell, and enjoyable for a very long time. Anyone who can't vibe with this is a straight-up hater (or maybe you just don't like crafting in games, which is fair)."
Yourmumsbills,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"I like many people and  across several platforms, share my switch with my partner. practically  Locking the game to one user per console is absolutely disgusting. That's all ther is to say."

AlexKidd,"Mar 20, 2020",9,"As a first timer to the animal crossing series, it was a bit hard to get into at first, but i really enjoy it now. The music, the graphics, the vibe, it's all so relaxing. The only downside i can think of now is the crazy amount of dialogue you can't skip. Great game! Can't wait to play in other seasons!"
Pigeondirt,"Mar 20, 2020",0,It's absolutely ridiculous that the 5 members of my family that all share a switch have to only have one island. And on top of that the first person is the boss. You have really let me down Nintendo and hope you get this fixed. Also how is there no cloud save??? Welcome to 2020
GooMatt,"Mar 20, 2020",10,This is my first animal crossing game I’ve ever played. I am seriously addicted to this game I cannot stop playing. Maybe the best Nintendo game yet
simondobie23,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"my girls were so excited to get this game. I read nothing about because it doesn't interest me. Once they started playing it they realised that there was only one island per switch, and my god, do they hate that!!! My girls are years apart and what appeals to one doesnt appeal to the other.

This limitation feels arbitrary and ill thought out.

I hope a patch fixes this"
CelesteH,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"I’ve been a fan since the original GameCube version and this reminded me of why I loved Animal Crossing so much. It was so much fun to build up my own island from scratch, have everything exactly where I want and I feel like there’s endless things for me to do. It had me wanting to explore and try everything and it was so visually beautiful to look at. I can see being lost in this for the next long while. Zero regrets purchasing and blew my expectations out of the water!"
Adikia,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Ive seen a lot of these reviews saying, why is there only one island per switch. This was told to us way before the release, another thing, Anyone reading this debating whether or not to get it, please take the editors review more serious than these ones, as theres a group of Facebook switch members downrating the game on purpose, because they want another game to be higher rated :)"
dlguiga42,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"One island per console ruined the game for me. After my girlfriend set up the island, I realized I'm basically a guest in her island for pretty much anything now. It's not even proper sharing - she's the owner and I'm her guest in the Island.

I'll just let her play the game on her own and I'll play something else instead."
ThornBattleborn,"Mar 20, 2020",8,"Would be a perfect 10 if it weren't for the unnecessarily clunky couch co-op (especially considering how well the first animal crossing implemented it) you have a primary player who can play the game as normal and a secondary player who can... Sit there and look pretty? They can pick up items, albeit slowly with an annoying animation playing each time and items are sent to the recycle bin instead of your inventory. You can fish and catch bugs, but only as long as they're on the same screen as the primary player (they are often much more spread out so there is only one at a time on the screen)The only saving grace is the fact that you can switch who the primary is by simply shaking the controllers. Otherwise this installment of animal crossing is vastly improved from the previous games, with better visuals, customisation and more quality of life improvements than i can count. In older animal crossing games i only found a couple hours of things to do per day, in New horizons there seems to be a plethora of activities to take part in with new activities opening up the more i play. The new ability to Terraform the landscape and really shape the island to my liking is a more than welcome addition and makes me feel like I'm really starting a little town of my very own! If you are playing on your own, you won't be able to find a better animal crossing experience! If you are buying this to play with a friend, however, just keep the limitations of couch co-op in mind before you buy. Nintendo should have been more transparent about this clunky co-op pre-launch but i know exactly why they weren't (and Tom Nook would have done the same thing)"
Audeclis,"Mar 20, 2020",2,"It's immensely disappointing to purchase the game and learn that there is very little value for a family. Whereas I can share my other games with my children, the fact that only one of us can make true progress in the game is a letdown and just another example of Nintendo being completely tone deaf and out of touch.

Beyond this, though, the fact that few reviewers discuss this fact is abhorrent. The game simply does not deserve the praise it is receiving from the media in the face of such a glaring misstep, highlighting their own massive blind spots.

At this point, while an okay but slow game, in the face of its price and the limitations its value drops far below far more mediocre games that are at least enjoyable more broadly."
sknight1213,"Mar 20, 2020",10,This game is absolutely amazing as a constant side game for one's day. It a great game to relax with.
CryBabySeann,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"The looks, the feel, and the improvements from the other games are amazing."
Aladis,"Mar 20, 2020",8,"this game is great and similar to other life sim games. It’s unfair to rate this a 0/10 because Nintendo doesn’t cater to your 10 person family. However, I do think that you should’ve be able to buy more than one copy per console. But the idiots out there who think that you should let 10 people start their own island per copy is kinda dumb. Overall, the games has some heavily needed QOL updates and for that I can only rate it 8/10."
Doublematt23,"Mar 20, 2020",10,People are over reacting amazing single player meh multiplayer simple Nintendo has meh multiplayer
manute12,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Best AC game ever. It combines all i´ve loved of previous games and added new features that makes this game so much enjoyable.
dr_heartless,"Mar 20, 2020",10,An amazing game and the best AC yet! If you don’t understand there is only one town per system sorry you don’t get AC.
iamlegionWEARE1,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"The game is broken bugged right out the get go. I started a game,progressed my Island, etc. Later in the day, my wife gets on the family console to play, and is totally confused. The game only allows one person to play it on a console, the other profiles can only get a severely stripped down version of your island. No way to have their own profile. Some fanboys claim this was on purpose, but I cant imagine Nintendo would make this big of a mistake on purpose. Once this huge bug gets fixed, I'm happy to reevaluate the score, but this is a solid 0/10 for blocking other players from playing beyond the first to start a game on the console."
Kelanisnot,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"People obviously dont understand the crossing if they think couch coop is a thing and you dont need multiple switches!! Amazing experience, best in class, best crossing game yet!!! Live love love!!"
Scarbelly,"Mar 20, 2020",9,This is easily without a doubt the best game in the series! It adds so many small features and the music is super chill.
Fliff,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Probably the best Animal Crossing has ever been, and to fans of the series it does enough to update the core gameplay loop to keep it fresh and interesting.

The negative reviews all seem to be people who have never played Animal Crossing before. The one island setup is intentional and has been a thing forever."
imoviesreview,"Mar 20, 2020",8,An overall enjoyable and relaxing game. It's basically an expansion of New Leaf mayor system which I enjoyed very much. So it cool to see a whole game around that.
novaaaa,"Mar 20, 2020",0,You can only create one island per switch and anyone else that joins the island literally cannot progress until the person who created it does. Greedy Nintendo at it again.
Heikki,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"An amazing game, that will make you forget there is something like a real world out there. Excelled in the good things New Leaf got right, and made an even better transition from handheld to console. 10/10"
Icraftfirestars,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Its a great game especially to play during the pandemic. Im really enjoying it. Stay positive and be safe out their.
Lazariel,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"Only ONE island per console!

You can't create a different island per user/account.
Once you have created an island on your console, all users have to share it.
Good luck if you have two or more kids...

Nintendo got away with forcing us to buy one game per user for years and years with Pokemon and Animal Crossing, and now they want us to buy one CONSOLE per user. They had the ""excuse"" of lack of memory space with cartridges, but with the Switch, there is literally NO GOOD REASON to do that but CORPORATE GREED.

That kind of practice shouldn't be allowed.
Seriously, shame on you Nintendo!"
hacazevedo,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"BEST GAME OF MY LIFE!!!! THIS GAME IS THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN, PERFECT GRAPHICS, PERFECT GAMEPLAY, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT, but if you see some negative reviews is why they didn't feel the classic game that was your friend play and advance some parts and that's a good and nostalgic thing. So my grade is 10/10"
Tma0405,"Mar 20, 2020",9,"There are no words to describe the flawlessly, gorgeous graphics and detail that have gone into creating this game. As an Animal Crossing fan that has played every game since gamecube, I am utterly amazed at how far the series has come. Does it have a little bit different feel? Yes but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable than any of the other games I've played in the series. I have read all other people's reviews and the people giving it a bad review either new absolutely nothing about the series or did absolutely zero research before purchasing the game. I would give this game a solid 10/10 but I have to give it a 9 just because the game seems to start out more slowly than any of the others in the series and parts of the game feel a little more like work and more tedious than previous games. I would have liked the game to have started out with at least 3 villagers instead of 2 but all these things are very little complaints. Overall, the game is great and I look forward to playing it every day for the next several years to come!"
Tim0900,"Mar 20, 2020",9,Exactly what I expected from an animal crossing game. Great atmosphere and gameplay. The controls are intuitive and the game just works.
Gravy_Dreamboat,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"You can only have one island per Switch. If multiple people play on the same system, you’ll be tied to whoever started the first game’s island. Kinda kills any sort of independence."
Roachant,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"My wife and I were looking forward to playing this game when it released. I bought it, I let her play first she made an island and played for a bit. Then I decided to play only to discover that Nintendo only allows one island per switch! Not only that, the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do. So, if you have more than one person in your home that wants to play the game, you need two switches. Worst decision I have ever seen, this even beats EA.
Congratulations Nintendo, you have officially become the worst video game company this year!"
ProfessorFox,"Mar 20, 2020",0,BEWARE!  If you have multiple people in your house that want to play this game they can not each have their own account (island).  ONLY ONE customizable island can be played per Switch.  Even if you buy two copies of the game you will still only be able to customize ONE island.  I have 3 kids that want to play this game and they each want to customize their own island - AND THEY CANT!   This is absolutely unacceptable.  Maybe the dumbest thing Nintendo has ever done.  I have owned every Nintendo console since the original NES and I can not think of a worse decision by Nintendo.
Houndf,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"We need equal values and opportunities for all players on the island! My wife is the first player, which is great but I do not want to wait for her progress. At the same time, I do not want her to have a a second class player experience if I am the founder. Fix this Nintendo!!"
favouritecommi,"Mar 20, 2020",1,"Alright, so first things first the game itself is alright, HOWEVER, if you have more than one person in your household only the FOUNDER will be able to enjoy it as supposed to. Not only you can not have multiple islands (not even sure how to react on that in 2020), but also the first player gets all proper interactions, quests etc. If you share a console other players will be limited to the progress of player 1.

But what's worse is a local coop, the second player is basically a slave of the main one without inventory and even being able to proper pick-up stuff (so you have to jump around the main player for usual exchange). Not to mention the second player animation every time it picks sth up from the ground (like ""hey I found this"") especially annoying when you have those quests like collect 200 sth. Also, the second player is unable to do anything while the first one is in the inventory menu.

Also, small things like not being able to rotate the camera or change the location of the tent are annoying.

IDK to it seems like Nintendo tried to make ppl buy more consols or sth. Disappointed."
Skideye,"Mar 20, 2020",8,"It's a very slow start (a few real-time days), but once you get past that **** world opens up massively. It's a peaceful game to hop into whenever you feel like it, and rewards those that play long hours, or even 1 or 2 at a time. Highly recommended to those looking for an escape (and if you truly want to customize your character, get the pro editor in the nook miles store"
ZachPack,"Mar 20, 2020",10,This is the second best looking game on the switch in terms of art style and graphics and the game play is just like good old classic AC and i love the new mile system to keep doing daily activities in-game i hope the future updates keep the game going for years.
SprinkleBunn,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Best animal crossing game. Just everything I wanted for so so long. As a big animal crossing fan I'm giving this the yes.
Can't wait to experience so much more."
killunit,"Mar 20, 2020",9,"Absolutely charming and relaxing game for all ages. The game is made primarily with single player in mind, but can be enjoyed with friends. The game is meant to be played in short bursts and is wonderful for sharing with the whole family. Daily and seasonal changes are sure to keep players coming back to see what's new. The changes to the franchise give more control than ever before to let the denizens of an animal crossing village customize to their heart's content. Finally the DIY system has completely overhauled the game allowing for crafting a multitude of useful new items. This is a must buy for fans of the series and a strong recommend for anyone looking to enjoy casual bouts of exploration into the once again fresh world of animal crossing."

shadowmancer66,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"An absolutely awesome addition to the franchise. Everything about this game has been tailor made for longtime fans of the series. There's a ridiculous amount of quality of life upgrades to the game, any fan of the series will adore the game!"

You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable."
Pmango0312,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"People, stop freaking out about the whole 1 town, 1 switch thing. Honestly, you probably have two switches/ switch lites if you really want to play with anyone in your family. Everyone is just looking at the game’s one multiplayer flaw and immediately giving it a zero. No one is looking at the game by itself, and I see a extremely polished Animal crossing game that me and my brother are having a blast with. There are some quality of life issues, for example selling stuff doesn’t let you select multiple items to sell at a time( same with buying), but those can be easily overlooked. It’s probably one of the best looking switch games, and the music is phenomenal! Definitely a game you can really sink your teeth in until Nintendo eventually gives us another great game to play. I haven’t gotten to try out the online yet, but it does look really fun going to your friends islands and helping them too. Hopefully this has convinced you to get this game, and don’t listen to the whiners
complaining about one problem who don’t see the game for what it truly is."
HappyHermyHype,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"By far the best Animal Crossing game yet. Sure, one island per system is oldscool (it was there in every animal crossing game), but it should encourages beeing social and sharing one island with your family."
RocketRon,"Mar 20, 2020",0,This is so annoying. Only one player has the ability to play this game because only one island. Nintendo doesn't deserve my money anymore.
lolo2178,"Mar 20, 2020",5,"While the game itself is great, really relaxing and gorgeous, i can't ignore one thing that ruins the whole experience for me and a lot of other people as seen by the different user reviews.

That thing is that you only have 1 island per console. This decision limits to one person being able to enjoy the full experience. It also nukes any creative control of the island, since you have the other users
house and furniture. I hope nintendo can soon fix this big issue, because for now, this killed any intentions i had to play the game."
tb726,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"The limitation of one island per Switch (not per cartridge, per Switch) is nonsensical. It‘s obvious Nintendo is just trying to sell more Switch consoles. This means only one person in your family can enjoy the game to its fullest extent. Player 2 can barely do anything, and their progression is blocked until player 1 progresses further. Player 2 can’t make any administrative decisions. Players 1 and 2 have to share limited daily resources. I had to delete my save so my brother could enjoy the game.

Sorry but this is an instant 0/10. The Switch is a family-oriented console and this is not a family-oriented game. This is a colossal failure on Nintendo’s part."
LucianoBR,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Excelente game! Divertido em todos os aspectos! Um prato cheio para fãs da franquia!
CDizzness,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Best Animal Crossing game hands down, graphics are gorgeous and gameplay is addicting as always (the moment I was able to pick objects up, I spent an hour picking up weeds XD) So many trolls talking about a horrible co-op experience, more than likely mislead because they don't research a game before they buy it, they just buy into the hype. This game lives up to the hype for this long time Animal Crossing fan. The co-op experience reminds me of the good ol' DS days. I haven't gotten too far into it yet, but I am already addicted and see myself coming back to the island every day, even if it is for a short amount of time. Also, I am the only person on my console playing this game, and I don't time skip because I am a patient person along for the experience. Thank you Nintendo, sorry people are review bombing your game because they clearly didn't watch all of the videos you put forth in preparation for the game.
Update 4/4/2020: This game has officially consumed my life. With the coronavirus bs going on and everything closing, this allows me to ""hang out"" with friends and family. It scratches the itch for social interaction, and I literally cannot stop playing this. Soooo much customization, you can literally recreate your entire island. This game deserves a much better user score than what it has,  I would say at the lowest an 8.5."

Doovde,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"A fantastic little game that will eat up your spare time. Whether it be decorating your home, growing and tending your garden, socialising, adventuring, shopping, teraforming the landscape, crafting or interacting with the wildlife, Animal Crossing has something for everyone.

The game works in real time so times of days, seasons, deliveries, and events change depending on what's happening in the real world. This creates a slower paced game and allows you as a player to take your time and let your little island grow organically with every decision you make. There are some complaining about island sharing with others on the same console but the fact is it makes the game better. Islands are sizable so there is plenty of space for everyone but most importantly this is a social game and multiple residents makes it easier to harvest and share resources which is ESSENTIAL to progression. All in all a wonderful game and highly recommended."
Elleeooo,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"That's a fantastic game, the beat animal crossing since the first hours player i can't ask something better"
Drud,"Mar 20, 2020",7,"Im Currently 18 hours in, with over 2 months worth of time skips. Game seems worse than its predecessors, Overall its a fun experience, but its limited in ways that i can only believe are to allow more copies to be sold before people can see the lack of content. Im on my 4th house expansion with a town of 6, shop upgraded. And it seems like im at the end of the museum collection. The little things that made the previous games feel special are missing, while new mechanics are in place to create a facade of advancement. Tons of things are missing from previous games that have become staples. Removal of the stat system for catches also removes half of the excitement of catching the same stuff over and over since you cant get a New best because size simply no longer exists. Controls could have been improved alot for this game, There are no touch functions despite having alot of use in many areas, such as home design and patterns or basic inventory management. Information is sparse. The game expects you to understand what your doing and why your doing it with zero direction for majority of the game. Honestly if this was any other game it would score much lower and i haven't even gotten into the multiplayer aspect both locally and online."
Rankaku,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"As a vetern New Leaf player, I really enjoy this recent release. Its really relaxing and fun to play each day. This type of game isn't for binging in one sitting, it takes time to fully play it.

Defo recommend it for any switch owner!"
eliasstosve,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Made a metacritic account just to give this game a 10/10
Today is the day my Animal Crossing addiction began."
mercurysmessage,"Mar 20, 2020",6,"An awesome Animal Crossing Experience. Being able to build out your island the way you like is an awesome feature. It's almost like having a crossover episode between Minecraft and Animal Crossing.

The only negative is the one Island per console. If we could have even one per User I would have given this game a higher score."
flori_vld,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"The long awaited hype for the sequel to Animal Crossing New Leaf has been met!
The short delay was well worth it and I'm happy Nintendo took their time!"
necai,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"Forcing there to only be 1 island per account completely ruins multiplayer for any family or residents that share a switch. The only way to enjoy this with your family is purchasing multiple switches, and that's completely ridiculous. There's no reason not to have the option of starting a new Island. Just shady business. The game is fun, unfortunately, not everyone who lives on the island will get to experience that."
chokkaku,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"I love animal crossing and this is the best title
everything is beautiful, everything is improved, and every animal crossing fan needs to play just say that.
for people who are saying that nintendo didn't warn about being an island by nintendo switch, it's a lie, everything was warned, we even had a nintendo direct of animal crossing talking about everything in the game."
FavorableGamer,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons was one of the best first-party games exclusively published by Nintendo. Packed with new and interesting content, it is something worthwhile for individuals looking forward playing the next series of Animal Crossing. Recently, they showcased so much information on Animal Crossing Direct, and there were exciting things we can do. For instance, the ability of being able to terraform and waterscape the land, achievements, 8 players online, customizations, and so on. While playing it, one of the honorable mentions was the writing itself, which may be referred to as the character’s dialog. Because they were willing to add variety of words when they talk, it seems enjoyable and natural to go talk with different characters in the game. However, there are downsides. You might have only one island per console, which means you cannot have multiple islands in the game. Besides, the incapable of not supporting cloud-saves. It needs to be supported, so people won’t get their internal data lost. Although, the game fully meets expectations with a good gameplay in which it is intended for hardcore audiences. At last, this is beyond the next level of Animal Crossing game, and a must-buy title in 2020."
supman,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Best animal crossing game of all time. This is so beautiful. So comfy. Yeap GOTY.
Veodok,"Mar 20, 2020",9,Super fun! Would recommend to any animal crossing fan! The island progression is really fun to go through and the book miles tasks are really engaging!
aperoll,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Imagine rating it one star simply because you don't like one design choice. As if all of the good was completely wiped out simply because you can only have one island.

It **** that that's the case, but at the same time the game is fantastic. I mean, it's the best animal crossing experience so far. You'll love it."
MrsPandora,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"This is just my Happy place game along with breath of the wild and Fire emblem three houses, all relaxing and chill, nothing about it feels unfinished or not fun, everything feels like it belongs in animal crossing and easily took over my life in the last few hours, and I know it won’t wear off"
Outryder86,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"I was very excited for this new installment of the Animal Crossing series. And I wish I could say that all the new bells and whistles and pretty graphics have made it the best ever. But Nintendo made the worst decision they could have possible made for this game.

You can only have one island per SWITCH. Not per user profile. Not per Cartridge. Per SWITCH.

This game is supposed to be Zen. It's not supposed to be the reason for a spike in domestic homicides. Having to share limited space with multiple family members competing for limited daily resources basically makes this game unplayable if, like a reasonable human, you only have one of these consoles in your family because they already have multiplayer support and you shouldn't need more than one for everyone to enjoy a game.

Nintendo needs to patch this, or else refund every person that isn't a single person household with this game."
revan4ik,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"this game dragged me too much, I can’t live without it ... help me please."
Myohmy,"Mar 20, 2020",10,This game is already a 20/10 just playing less than 5 hours. It’s already blown new leaf out of the waters.
Thomas0968,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Невероятная игра с уникальной атмосферой. Точнее то нужно для релакса в 2020!^_^
Не понимаю тех, кто ставит это милой игре 0 баллов. У вас нет чувств!"
Subby89,"Mar 20, 2020",0,It's 2020 and for some reason Nintendo has decided that only one island is available per Switch console. Meaning my fiancé cannot progress the game beyond what I have done since I started my game first. She cannot place buildings down. She cannot obtain better tools until I've done it myself. Why is she hamstrung? She has to have a lesser experience because of it. This is an utter joke and I expect my money back. I'm being pushed into buying a new console just so she can have the full experience. I will NOT be buying a whole new console just for that. This is shameful.
chankills,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"I purchased this game for my household (me and my GF) and she started playing the game first. There was no advertisement or clear indication of this but each switch console is limited to one Island and the first person on that Island has a much better gaming experience than anyone else. Anyone else that joins the island cannot build and building, set any mandates, and cannot progress in the story (e.g. getting tools) until the owner of the island does. There are also restrictions on what the second player can put in the musuem. There is no reason for there not to be a second game file for each profile on the switch and Ninentdo attempt to push people to buy seperate consoles for this game is extremely greedy. Gameplay is actually great but the severe limitations and no forewarning leads me to post this review to tell people not to buy this game if more than one person will play on the switch."
Brittlehollow,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"If more than one person plays on a Switch, even with seperate profiles you are forced to share not only the island but all the resources as well.  Anyone playing on a file after the first person to create a file is extremely limited as well.  It is an absolute nightmare to play with more than one person."
BabaYega,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Carismático, relaxante, e com um esmero absoluto.

Um carinho absurdo da Nintendo nesta obra.

Obrigatório."
rafilks182,"Mar 20, 2020",1,"they heavily marketed this game as a social experience. a game to share with your friends and family. but heres the catch, you will need 1 nintendo switch for each player to get the full experience. I bought the game to share it with my girlfriend but the first player is considered as the FOUNDER of the island, and he is the one that will progress the story, that will unlock stuff and do all the cool things. The second nintendo switch profile will act merely as a villager, with little to no impact on the game and not able to progress without the founders progress. Game ruined by greed, want to have the full experience? BUY 2 PHYSICAL COPIES AND 2 NINTENDO SWITCHES, yeah thats what nintendo requires of you to play a social game if you want to be social."
leetl1,"Mar 20, 2020",9,Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a significant improvement over the tragically bad Amiibo Festival as it  goes back to the classic gameplay that we know from our childhoods.
sooners11,"Mar 20, 2020",0,One island per console is a pretty terrible and greedy design choice by Nintendo. Whoever is first on the island gets the full game experience and everyone else is gimped and cannot progress or do the same things.
kiddxan,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Ich liebe alles an diesem Spiel. Auch das neue Craften ist so eine gute idee gewesen. Die Musik ist auch wie in allen Vorgängern schön und beruhigend. Es fühlt sich einfach an ein perfektes Spiel
BennyFastFeet,"Mar 20, 2020",9,"Wonderful game, my first Animal Crossing. Nintedo Switch graphics are stunning. A lot like **** Valley, but more Nook! However, please let me pick up multiple items at once!"
septimal,"Mar 20, 2020",9,"I absolutely love this game; however, both me and my brother would like to have our own islands but this is not possible without the purchase of another switch. This is extremely disappointing as Nintendo intentionally did this; they could have just done the save files similar to games like BOTW or SMO, but they didn't. So, despite this being one of my favorite games this year; I feel Nintendo made a poor decision in forcing players to buy multiple switches to have multiple islands."
meritum,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Best animal crossing game. Beautiful and fresh game. You want to spend more time in the world you create with likable characters and lots of things to do. Minecraft of Switch era. So much creativity. Loving it so far
SuperDelphi,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"A brand-new Animal Crossing experience! And a fresh one. The in-game content seems endless, while the typical atmosphere of the franchise is fully present.
Nothing to say. Awesome"
Mathioso,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"What a great game just to relax and have fun, I already can't stop playing!"
no_uu,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"After some hours of playing,i can say my **** a good game,its really relaxing,and with this game you can take a break.this game is really good in this period because of the **** bad thing is that at the very first hours you can't explore that much because of the 2 rivers; also this game is not for everyone,not everyone can appreciate this **** anyway,its a really good **** has some really good graphics and i didn't see any graphic **** yeah,i reccomend this.(p.s this game is is even better with headphones!relaxing music+high quality sound effects is the best!you should try if you have some headphones.)"
Fakers,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Очень хорошая игра, мне очень понравилась стилистика этой игры"
Sorites,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"I haven't played animal crossing since Wild World on DS. This game is HD and a great step up. I've enjoyed every aspect of the game. This game is the best animal crossing game to date. People who are review bombing because they can't have seperate islands per switch are just being childish. The game wants to create that social experience and that decision is a creative one. I personally and glad that it's limited one island per switch. Get the game, you won't regret it."
FunkyVerb,"Mar 20, 2020",1,Same-console multiplayer is severely limited. The game was designed so that only one person per family can actually get the full experience. Do NOT buy this game if you want to play with multiple people.
skai90,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"This Game is perfect after a hard day of work to relax and have a good time.
You can play it 10 min a day or 4 hours a day - its a lot what you can do.
When you like NL you also will love NH!"
AmiigoCD,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Unique concept, pacing and vibe. A true open world game where you dictate the pace and even the plot. One of the all time great games."
Lumostark,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"The graphics, the gameplay loop, the music, the personalization options, the dialogues are all really charming. It's the scape from the world I've been looking for."
Arfon,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Countless hours of fun awaits you in this fabulous game!!! It has lots of new stuff and new mechanics that will keep you playing all day and night, but the effort is rewarded. You never get bored when you do all of the features like fishing, crafting, completing challenges, etc.
100% recommeded and truly a ""Must Play"" if you have a Switch."
Phantafun,"Mar 20, 2020",4,"A good game, for sure, but only 1 Island. With this limitation, to keep the interest longer, only my wife play.

Half the payer, half the rating. I Hope a change soon"
000PLAYER000,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Cant stop playing!
Edgery95,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"From my first 4 hours of playing, I can tell this game is an absolute master class in creativity.  I don't normally enjoy games like this but there's just something about the charm and progression system that fills me with joy. If you're on the fence and want a completely lax, joy filled experience, then I can't recommend this game enough!"
